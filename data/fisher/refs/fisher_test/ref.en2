hello
yes yes i am soon finished here
so there are various things like that so everything depends about the course but
um yeah here yea there is and i never write anything in general so it seemed a bit weird that i had to write
but um what else and now i'm sure you don't like it right
its really cold here right
yeah
nah yeah
hm
pe
but in peru they told me there are regions were its very very cold right
hmm mm
but but what
hmm i see
well i'm in wharton
so business yes and but then your are studying for phd is master's that is exactly
oh is undergraduate oh okay okay
oh but you are here now
but you live in peru then
do you live in peru
oh
so you are a freshman or
hello good night who's this
oh oh okay so you are not an exchange student you are a transfer
ah ah that's good
ah that's good and you think so far
yes but english is or is
however all the work
yes yes
yes
more than in peru
mm
hm mm
ah guillermo
mm
oh okay okay
yes yes
yes its still a lot
yes its hard
um it depends in general five sometimes its just that sometimes the past cycle i only took four but i'm not taking five
but in general in college people only take four
i think yeah but in wharton in general people take five
uh
yeah i have too i mean i have a small job at the library i work study but its like there i don't work when i dont go
ah i am jose
i study so its not really like that
mm
ah i would do that sometimes but where are you in which part of the library in
mm okay okay
in lippincott
is it's in the wharton library
yes it's in the second floor mm but yeah it's there it's a good job because i only work and i don't work a lot five hours a week sometimes i work ten hours a wee but
it is always like that i do my homework right so it's not much there are times for the final there is some more work because
there are more people who need help and the whole world
he is doing his investigations but in general it's a lot right i don't have much work
ah pe i live here in philadelphia
but if here it's eh but what i have seen is for example sometimes in latin america but you see that in europe
in the universities they give you during well in general there isn't much job until the final right so the professors
eh yeah in europe in general right
hmmm
hmmm
yes yes yes
yes well well they they don't give you a lot of homework but eh generally they want you to well you to
you to be reading everything to be solving exercises and to keep doing all that right
understanding everything right and then in the end they give you a test and that's your grade but here in america it's
different right because here in history you have to research and then an essay then something else and another and a test
yes yes and you
it's better in the sense that you okay there are less risks but
the work yes yes but
yes
yes
yes
yes but also all the work they gave us you know each week you have one think and other
other work then
each one each system has its cons and pros but and in peru how is it in general
hmmm
mmm
ah what do you study
mmm
mmm
mmm
mmmm
yes
hm mm
yes yes
yes yes
hm mm hm mm
yes hm mm mm
ah i am an student here too i am ah senior
yes yes
yes
yes yes
if wharton is also different because also depends it depends because for example classes that i have in general don't have
so testing or research generally only have two or three tests but there are classes for example that have more one has the two tests but also has projects
like case studies type
in groups in general in those days almost everything is in groups and of course they give you tasks and stuff because otherwise
because y like it that way for example each week have a little job to do that you have to present because in that way
you have an obligation to study
but yes i like this sometimes they do that but in general there are exams or projects but in
of university of pennsylvania too
each class there is always an exam i've never had a class with only projects usually two exams and maybe one project
now in marketing class we have a project that is like and i do not know how they did
they created a whole software that is like a simulator and then for example every order there are five or six orders then
one have a group
and then everybody to each group they assign a company
so one has various products this company has various products so one has to decide for every base for each product cause when we go what type of
how are we going to sell this product we are going
put more yeah yeah yeah like one but of course its nothing like real life but
it helps yes yes its not interesting but when its done you have to write various reports you have to make an analysis
of what one did the errors from what someone did it correctly
hello
ah how great
i would say that even um i remember once i went to the mountains of peru and um it was like vacations with my family and yeah at night
it could even get colder to what i've experienced here
and what are you studying
mm
is no undergraduate
mm mm mm mm mm mm
pardon
me sorry what did you say
i mean i lived in peru til three months ago
of course
no what happens is that i studied two years in the university of peru and then i transferred here in other words i'm an international transfer
how are you eh i am guillermo how are you
of course is eh eh in other words i'm going to graduate with a title from this university
a difference a an exchange student for example right
hey this a little hard truth
and well english english is in fact one say
it's difficult to study many parts of english but i have the time i know some of the difficult english expressions
no that is that's uh very clear to me
eh but otherwise if in the amount of work to me i'm told is also a
i do i think if you send more
more than in peru even last season peru this i at my university take six courses eh one semester
and and even so i think i had less work than what i'm having now taking five courses
yes
but hey what happens is that i'm giving five courses but also work
i don't know sometimes its equivalent to take six subjects something like that
its sometimes a little less i don't think its so so demanding like taking six subjects but
i think so yes yes i don't know maybe in the future they will
i i i would like to take less subjects i don't know how many subjects do you take
yeah and and you
yeah
i understand and you work as well
or do you study full time
oh it seems so good that you do it in your own workplace in the library but i'm a shelver
how are you where you from
hence really i don't get the opportunity to study
in the fifth floor of van pelt
you where do you work
where is that
ok
hm mm
hmm mm
ah in england for example
yes i've also heard that the quantity of for instance of the numbers of hours that take during the week
they're i think they're less than three
in philadelphia
then you have a lot of spare time i mean you don't have a lot of classes
and besides that i think i mean they don't give you a lot of homework no i'm not sure
sure hmmm hmmm
hmmm
yes yes that definitely is an advantage right there are less risks
because imagine that for example your whole grade was to be decided by a test maybe the night before you couldn't sleep well
anything could have happened and then
you don't perform well in the test you might have studied a lot but for any reason you didn't do well in the test then
i mean let's say that the grade
it lowers your grade i don't know i mean
me i am peruvian uhm i am studying in the university of pennsylvania
yes yes
well i would say that they make us work we don't have the equivalent midterms
but they are at most reading controls
spread l mean spread all along the semester
and for some courses they ask at the end of the course to present and essay an investigation paper
and besides that you also have a final exam but let's say you don't have to make as much as you do here
so you don't have to write that much
here they keep you constantly writing papers and reviews right
there not a lot o be there more well what i had to write for example i wrote in an exam or to deleiver an investigation
at the end of the semester but out of that no no no have to produce a lot
eh i study history
and well or this could be seen like ahead in the sense that you don't have they don't they don't they don't ask you for much or be
one can live a little more relaxed
but to the point the disadvantage is you do not get you manage to practice you you you you no no you are on a constant practice from the labor this
from investigation and also of of how to describe not real or is at times one for not writing as much so a little loses easiness not true to writethen
that is why i said or is more is more easy or is
is more easy but i do not know if is lets say yes if it form you as well that they form you
but it has costs that you formor sea the the cost is that aaca they better form is fine but at least i for example this weekend i'am full of things to do so
you live a little more well at least i lived a little more anxious let's say a little more
stressed
but i don't know how it's gon na be in wharton
of what university
yes
and there are personal items or in groups
of course
hm mm
hm mm hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
ah that's interesting
but you mean it at least works on something
hmm mm
ah yes
hm mm
yeah
what
well yeah yeah yeah it was raining on tuesday
i froze yeah i mean i have to go with my huge jacket i mean i have i bought a jacket that helps a lot
and i have i mean i always go out with it but sometimes maybe while wearing the jacket i get cold but oh well inside my room its well um
its manageable the issue inside the dorm the temperature is enough
its warm right
well of course if you go to the mountains
also at night in conclusion even if you go to the mountains during winter winter nights are very cold yeah
hello my name is gloria
of ah ok am i am catholic so i believe in my opinion am they separate people for example i have a nephew who is gay
really ah yes i think she is from georgia
yes from atlanta yes yes yes
ah in ah
ah okay okayyes one of my nieces lives in georgia but she moved she still lives in georgia but sshe had to sell her house because he got divorced from her husband
so she had to sell her house and now she is alone yes
yes my niece yes she is about forty something years old
yes
then they in the catholic religion they do not accept gays
because god didn't make them like that but if i remember when i my nephew was born at one year we knew that he that he that he was going to do it
people don't believe they are born like that but he was born like that and only if you have someone in your family then you know then he
has lots of problems with the catholic religion because they don't accept them and he knows that they don't accept them but in the end he found a church on thirtysecond in new york which accepts homosexuals
mmh aha
mmh
aha
mmh
exactly
oh from new york
mmh
mmh
mmm
i see i see
yes like this one what should i have said me at night me to the girls where i work three
i bring a book from joyce myers everyday scriptures i read it to them and then they said it it's rubbish and i said but
listed what she is saying listen and learn to treat nice your neighbor like you'll want to be treated oh but i don't have to treat her nice
i don't like her i say to her that we all are created like god and we start the fight then i say look i want peace why do all this happens why don't we talk about
about the day's topic but forget that it has become a they still look for me for reading everyday
because it's like a rocket i was saying that i don't want to be with her because she takes away
from long island
all my energy she is always criticizing everyone and i don't want to be in that environment she says if a read all days the other ones is saying
right five things about why you are thankful to god she is always reading about religion
i think that this has saved my mind because if not i start to criticize that everyone criticize me and i know that i'm a god person and god loves me as i am
if i let myself go with people say i would have jumped from a window
and that's what is happening to her she is being criticized i told her look god loves you as you are but you can't keep criticizing everyone
yes
yeah
yes yeah
yeah
yes yes yes yes
from long island
yeah yeah
it's that the uh precisely the catholic religion everyone is leaving like my my friend who went to another church she tells me
this that and this and that and i tell her you have to find the church you want the one you believe that that completes you
or that i won't tell you go to the catholic church if it's giving you nothing just because i go to catholic church
so then she she found another church she tells me maybe you should go with me i tell her no leave me be i'm very happy where i am
and you know i go to charismatic groups so i i i like to go to other churches i'm not saying i don't but i don't want her to
i have gone to that church already a long time ago and and it takes the whole sunday and i don't have all day on sundays to be there
three or four hours
yeah
ah eh i think it's christian science something like that
aha
yes yes yes they're like born again christians something like that
something like that so you know i she was catholic but her husband goes to to the catholic church i in my house i'm the only one who goes to church my son doesn't like to go i'm always arguing with him so he'll go
and he doesn't think god is helping him so i tell him i tell him every day god gave you that like today we were talking about
katrina and he says ouch god did that
and i couldn't convince him it wasn't god that was an act you know an act of god as they say but it wasn't
god himself he doesn't although the bible said things like that were going to happen so i was telling him maybe read the bible it teaches what
hmmm
yes yes
yes
yeah yeah
oh from georgia oh my god
exactly they sit there and when the priest stops they leave they run
yes
it is yes yes like lately i am going to a charismatic group so i am understanding more even though they say it in spanish and i don't understand i can speak spanish but i can not read it nor write it
so then they gave me a hispanic bible as a gift and i forget it i am reading it but i don't know then i go and explain it to them i red this and this and this
that is what then they read it in english to see if i can understand it but it becomes very difficult the bible is is
eexactly exactly so i find it very difficult so i they give me some some passages and then i read it and then they tell me this is this and this and this
you know and and they start to use it like in our lives and i say oh okay then i understand
i am puerto rican
yes yes yes yes i was born in puerto rico but i grew up in new york what they call el barrio in east what they call the barrio in manhattan
yes you _ you have always been from georgia
i didn't understand what she said
oh from chile oh okay
but i saw aha
ah
wow wow wow wow
wow
aha aha
aha
wow you travel a lot
aha that's good that's good to move like that you see i live
i lived in manhattan then i lived in the bronx and now i moved to long island and we stayed here even though when we retire we're going to live i guess
something about religion she said to talk
in florida because my boy my oldest boy and my grandchildren live in florida
so i would like to go i would like to go to florida to be close to them but by the time i go already my grandson maybe he has already gotten married
because he's already seventeen years old by the time i retire it's ten more years he'll be twenty seven maybe he's going to get married
i am going to be right
yes
right
oh where there's work and what do you work in there
oh oh you're at home with your children oh that's good
oh my god yes yes that's a lot of work right i do i do children parties i dress like a clown and now i'm trying to imagine how can i make elmo's head
because i have the the bodysuit but
no
the head is my friends so her and i did a party so sometimes they ask for two and we couldn't go only one can go
so i'm trying there my friend is making me one but the head is very heavy so i can't even imagine how we're going to make that head
so and and through that because i wasn't listening to what the lady was telling me because a tape of and i say oh i'm doing a lot of things i have to focuse
all at the same time because sometimes they call and they don't call and sometimes i pick it up and i don't pick it up and there were they gave me this discussion last week and i don't know why the argue about the same thing
you know you have done that a long time that
oh like me yes something like that yes
oh okay yes
ah i found i have a friend that's named norma i think that she lives in georgia also
yes yes yes she is peruvian yes
yes yes yes every i have spoken to her four times
hello
she was talking about religion what is the opinion on religion if it unifies people or if it keeps them apart if all should belong to the same religion or what do i know
aha
ok well i think that regarding religion that if people followed their religion there wouldn't be so many problems like when they go to the extremes be it any religion
if people followed for example the ones who follow jesus christ if they followed the teaching of jesus christ and if they acted as jesus christ acted
there wouldn't be so many problems
but when they start to fight that's not what was taught
jesus christ
where there are problems
same with muslims
or jews the principles of of these religions and what they teach
hello gloria i am paulina where do you call from
yes those are good things but when people gets really fanatic they don't accept other people we respect differences
i think that that's when division starts problems
nice
yes
and it's true it's the same when
in relation with everything like religion as a people look whats happening in israel between
between the palestinians and the
and the jews
it's sad they fight all the time
because they both have sacred places but they don't respect
new york i am in georgia
other people
ah yes
what religion is she your friend
oh
i see
hmmm
hmmm yes
that's right i find that about religion many people go only in the name of tradition
when you go and seek for the the truth
and you really seek then you find a religion that
ah
you like but many people go only only for tradition but they don't know what their own religion is about
yes or don't study the scriptures by themselves or anything
yes it helps when one starts to study that what one believes in is their own religion
the bible yes the bible is difficult the vocabulary it uses anyway it doesn't matter what language i find
hmm where are you from
puerto rican but you grew up in the united states
ok i don't know
no i am from chile
yes i grew up and was raised in chile and when i finished middle school of high school i came to study to the university to

and i have a list on the contrary for me to study i can't have that type of music on i can't be listening to classical music i need music
that has lyrics because if there are none if it doesn't have lyrics it's like it bores me i nee i need something to distract me
25
eh eh with i work with viruses
in biology
so that i always need something to distract me that that keep a attentive
yes yes if i play classical music i don't
i i fall asleep i on have m i only play classical music when i have many times when i have to eh if i have to write a paper that i need to be very very very concentrated
so then but always since i was little when i had to study i was always listening to music and while i was singing i could be reading and my dad always criticized me that
it's impossible that a person could read and sing at the same time but i don't know it always worked for me i always got good grades so
i i supposed that
no
yes that doesn't that doesn't attract me at all the the music i mean eh you can
okay pardon
28 ah me too
good evening
yes
and you
and also live music i also like it
live music
yes
ojay
yes
exactly
exactly
right
yes how are you
right right me too because i play my instrument and my husband plays his and at least maybe some festivals and so
there is a bar close to my home where many people come to pley every night people just sit there and play their instrument
and there are open circles every night and songs from where people play and then in the weekends come here several music bands
to play every night in the weekends and it's very cool
i like everything
to me that i dom't like i think rap hip hop and pop music
so i don't like britney spears and so that doesn't call my attention at all
i do like i do like spanish rock very much i have a lot of spanish rock and bluegrass
well i like in spanish rock i like fito paez a lot
who is from argentina
ah i am josma from philadelphia
yes i like him very much
and ah mm and i the american music you have a guy who's name was is very good
and the one who died that was too a good singer at least around here where i live you have allot of people that perform
lots of our friends that perform and sing and have groups
and all the groups they have are very very good indeed
right and at least this year i did go to a concert of ah willi nelson
and bob dylan
and you had people of all ages like sixty seventy years old and children of eighteen years too at the concert
yes then yes right then they had it on a small stadium baseball one and you didn't yeah didn't had lot of people but
but yea it was really really good the concert
how is it going
more yea more than anything we but music but also we buy a lot of music from groups like that that aren't very popular that it's like that people that we know
yes because we're members of a of the ah the society of folk music in philadelphia and so there at least there's lots of musicians
that are members and they give concerts in houses and all that every month
there's a concert in in a house of one of the members and we buy all those cds
from groups that we see there that that who are that aren't super super famous but that yea they're good
and so sometimes we've we've seen at least some groups that we
we knew we were famous and all of a sudden we're listening to it we're at a festival or something like that
and all of a sudden we hear a song that is famous
but
no no no my husband used to play in a band but that group's not together anywhere maybe they're going to maybe they'll get back together
of the music good i listen to some latin music and some american music and yes folklore and bluegrass music country
but no we don't play for any band or sometimes my husband that plays with his friends but what happens is that we don't have much time like to
like to commit with the people
because of work and that doesn't and and we don't have time to commit with a band yes with a band because if you have a band you have to practice at least one day
week
ok
so yes you can to dedicate a lot of time and the at least there is a band that wants my husband to play with them
but where they meet they meet on wednesday nights around ten at night and the they practice until two in the morning on wednesdays
because he has to work and the school and that doesn't have enough time
mn
it happens to me if i don't sing a song for a log time i forget it but i i was the other day i was talking to a friend and
25
and we were with her we listened a song on the radio that she hasn't listened for about eight years and she remembered the hole song
and they played a song that i haven't heard before i hadn't listened to that song for four years and i know a song and
i knew the song but i didn't remember the lyrics i remembered just a bit not much i don forget them if not
if i don't listen to them often i forget the lyrics i know the tunes but not they lyrics i forget
aha
aha
exactly
ah and to study
yes
what what do you study
mm oh 28
ok
ok
exactly
mm
i had a teacher
that said that when no when you're studying something that you need to something that you need to learn that if you sing what you need to learn you learn it better
faster than if you read it normally
28
ah
hi do you speak with fabiola
yes i say the same
we bought them through jcpenny
they are arriving bit by bit first there arrived some curtains last night another part arrive a part for the top
then after i got another top part and there are still stuff missing i still need three curtains that still need to arrive that have not come yet
the ones in the dinning room i didn't put because how do you say i didn't put perciana
no because the the rest of the house i put percianas but not the dinning room because the windows are not windows they are small windows
then they don't make them that size unless you get them specially made for that
ah yea the best thing that's happened to me was meeting my husband
and the second and the other great thing that happened to me was to have my kids
to be healthy to be healthy
yea really
yes
why it's ok all of that about nice subjects that well you can find interesting things to talk about when you talk on here because they also play music for you yesterday the music was
eh yes and it's fun you talk twelve minutes and then they cut off your call
yes they tell you you've got thirty seconds left to say goodbye
and so we have twelve minutes to talk about whatever we want because they're using it to recognize our voices
right and that's how it works and and they pay you
you have to talk about you have to talk about what they tell you to or whatever you want to the idea is to talk because that's all they're recording the whole conversation
who is who
by the accent the system and the form of speaking and
by the speech tone and something are already invented
then they need people that have different voices
and the
yes the girls they all connect with this number
and talk at the same time and hour
and they connect and good
yes but i don't know if you can make two calls at the same time
brilliant or not
aha i don't know that you can listen the voice of those kids pretty
yes i can hear you very clearly
yes they are and what are you doing to make them laugh
they're looking at each other and laughing and saying you look like me oh no you look like me
kids are entertaining and oh my how they're growing and are you talking to them
do you have to talk to them now or not
are you talking to them are you talking to the kids
in english
oh
in english that's good because they're going to speak both languages and
about all the best things that have happened to you in life
yes
he picture geni with both languages but he also uh talks to me in both languages and he can read both languages but he has an accent and has troubles with spanish
and despite that since she was little and has her first 3 years she was born here
but when she was two and a half months old i took her to chile and in chile
she learned words by herself she couldn't say full phrases because he
we came here every year on vacation and one month here
and the dad always spoke to her in english
and yes and then he uh and when she listened she heard bad spanish from michel
or bad english from myself
now i speak a better english michel speaks a better spanish and now she can read in both languages and she's getting better but they get confused when the dad
and how has your life changed
speaks with an accent a strong accent
but isn't that bad
it is not good no
yes starting at four months old children start to
and do you have plans for christmas or thanksgiving
ok
yes
for christmas are you already planning the gifts and all that
the gifts are you planning for christmas or not
not yet
and what is the best thing that has happened to you in life
so then the the children are going to be grown up for christmas they are going to play already
that's gorgeous
i'm thinking about buying uh we're buying the tree
a live tree like every year we buy it alive
um we'll see i don't know look i bought michel a car
yeah
a big remote controlled car
uh of about a hundred and sixty dollars i got it on sale on fifty dollars
uh like james bond's
but it's james bond's and with a remote i'm gon na put it as a gift from santa claus
but the best you feel has happened to you in life
and for jenny i don't know yet i'm looking for something there's something she likes a lot it's a game boy but a new one
that you you don't use keys you touch the things and they start moving
a super super new one that came out
so i think i'm going to get that for her that i know that's what she wants
a karaoke machine
aha she loves it is good because at her age she's reading while the letters come out and get darker changing color
so then she is singing the song
and it entertains her a lot i tell you that's good to read faster that's that's super good for christmas and for for my fatherinlaw
i bought eh a gift on behalf of jonathan
that is a
that's a good subject
for the computer it has eh to move the mouse
you move the mouse and you have a calculator
no no no the place where you move the mouse is a little square
and that one
so i bought one for my father in law and one for us on behalf of jonathan
eh and he thinks that another good idea and i don't know why else
no we already bought the tickets we're going to arkansas we're going to arkansas to spend eh fifteen a week
mhm all the years we go for a week
oh yes
no but still it doesn't start
yes
sure but maybe it's not true that not and it's not true that
they told him that is there they have the personal in any case they are going to let him know
is like we call you later
but the work in chile hasn't started yet
still there i also was touched i told michel michel if it comes out we go
michel yes yes but
it's the same as what i think i say how we going to go even with the new house we bought how they tell me
we'll sell it then and it makes me laugh because for him it's so easy like nothing more to get rid of it take the stuff and get rid of them
and for me it cost me a lot of work
yes and after to put it together i tell you i haven't even put up the curtains those curtains are arriving in a bit
hello hi
i think that everything starts knowing someone because if i wouldn't have met him then no
yeah
and they are are they those in the living room
ahh you didn't put perciana
ah
speacially for
these kids wouldn't be here
yes because like
yes
for yes because if not because if you hadn't met the boy you you wouldn't be here
also i wouldn't have had these kids i wouldn't have known you either
if it weren't for him or
yes
hey i like them
ohh
and they connected you and that is how it worked
but uh what's it called you don't have to talk about what they tell you to
ah so that after the computer know that eh
and by the by the accent
mm
yes by the
ah no idea and i didn't called because i said it could be done
earlier
yes
ehh
then i would try to call later then or at noon best don't know
oh look also
the same day
yes i can hear it's that you're here
they're both laughing
they're right here the two of then are sitting on my legs one in front of the other and they're looking at each other and laughing
and one of them has the pacifier tied to the bib so he throws it at the one who's holding it and he throws it
ah
what
yes yes i'm talking to them i talk to them all the time and i speak to them in
in spanish
and you speak to them in english
then let's talk about the memories
yes because that way later they grow up with the two languages
just because and also because they grow with uh without an accent
eh
m
and where did she learn to speak did she learn to speak when she was in chile well yes
ahh
ah
so she was like confused
m
ah
ah
the bad part is i mean when i speak to them in spanish but the bad part is that for example when i'm with someone else and they speak english
i speak to them in english i understood
because no but it is bad because no because my accent is not i understood
and i know that they are small now they are not going to they are not going to speak now but what oh in any case they are recording all that then
it is that
for thanksgiving we are going to go with my with armi's grandparents they come back to eat because i
my motherinlaw is fixing the house
so we are going to have to go to his grandparents and they together
what
mm no not yet not yet no

mm
oh
mm
for the
ahh
eh
the mouse has a calculator

ah ok
eh
and will you be here for christmas or will you go to
a week
oh i christina told you the other time that they were thinking of going to to chile for work
and from there it didn't work for them
but he told me that maybe no and everything that
if i know someone with these kids
mm
yes
something like that
ahh
would go
m
eh
because it cost you a ton to find the house
yeah
hmm
hello
yes
well and which subjects the most
oh
ah okay i see
yeah
yeah okay i see
mm
yes
yeah
mm
yes of course
yes exactly
ah okay
yes but it's like i say in high school subjects start to get more specialized i mean chemistry and physics are more advanced
aha
yes
yes
yes yes yes
yes no
mm
mm
yes i've heard about that
do you study or work
many very good lots of luck
but like you also say i mean they are barely two no you don't have to think too much about that yet
okay
uhumm
yes okay
okay
uhum
yes she reads
yes
yes she knows the order
oh wow that's nice
yes that's good
yes that sounds that sounds pretty interesting
i don't know anything i don't know so if i were in that situation i don't know what i would do because i would never imagine how
give classes to my son i could not because also i tell the truth i'm not that i mean no i did not have an education on how to give classes do you understand
i imagine that you have studied something like education or something like that no
what did you study
yes no
aha
of course of course of course you adquire all the classes offered
um
yes well of course
yes of course too much work at home i imagine
that's good but very happy i imagine no
yes the boy is four days old
wow a very few
that's young listen and this then why do you live in the united states have you lived there all your life or
who is speaking
ok
mh mhm
mhm
okay
ah okay
uh huh
ah okay
ah very little
ah okay
yes
hello anny i am arturo
yes yes of course
and now you are married with a latin guy or an american
oh i see
oh ok it's from miami i guess
ah ok
ok
oh i see very well
and
so in which language do you speak with your well at this moment they don't even talk your children because
he has 24 moths no
fro where are you calling
23 well he is
mm
okay
ah okay
know them
ah yes
ah for real
wow yea
very fast
also no or what age do children normally start talking i don't know really
from miami very good i am speaking from
okay
right
yes yes
yes
yes
ah
yes but
of course yes it would be more difficult but well i think well in the longrun it would be good too right growing up with these languages is an advantage
really
mm
philadelphia
yes yes i can imagine
yes
yes right the kids are very clever after after no
you know
mm
then yes hopefully she remains that way because when she start growing more and lots of her friends talk in english she will practice more of it i think
ah okay
ah
aha
yes that's true
yes where are you from
but but what do you think about the fact she will not have school colleagues and such
that's an experience too no i mean
aha
ah ok
ah ok
the
ah ok
yes
yes of course that's what i was thinking because if i mean it's part of the experience no of being at school that you meet people
so i think that also that's important its not that is not that you miss that when your a kid because truly your friends are very important
ah ok
i think no
but if with that is having contact with other people it should be at least one weak but
yes there are many the thing is that here there is big support to the community really and that
yes i see
yes yes yes yes i like anything in mexico that is not common understand me absolutely does not happen
then i don´t know people who comes from that kind of schools understand me and always i have big curiosity on how they do here in the united states because here yes it is much more common there is lots fo people that
graduate from the school at home oh well at least before right now i don´t know
yes yes yes yes
yes and that can be very bad as well really
yes sure but we have to be careful because later it will be wrong to overprotect them
i am mexican
it can be very bad
yes
yes yes
yes it's true and until which year you think give him home schooling
yes
with time you'll see and know
but you think you're planning give him all primary right
okay
oh yes
so you have teach all they way up to high school or what
hello
are you studying here in the united states
so i was teaching everything
so i you know the thing is i if i don't know something
if i don't understand the subject or whatever i'll teach it to myself so i can teach the kids
so you know things like let's say algebra
it's not that i don't know it but it's more like i've forgotten it
because i don't use it
so eh you know before teaching the class what i did was like i reminded myself
what was it that i had to do
so i could teach them
so for me that's not really difficult i know that for some other person it could be but for me
that's good
and also that time i know that now
they even have classes that that the kids can take or the students can take on the computer
and they can go to a a high school let's say on the internet
so you know there's many many many options that are not only of
you know that one has to
put them in a public school also
you know i know that the universities here
have classes for kids also in high school that they can take in the university
so you know we have many options
and that
no eh i have a daughter of twenty three months and i have a son that is now four days old
no as my husband says you know that i am a teacher
and i'm always reading her books you know singing her songs
so that she wouldn't be you know so that she's always having fun and at the same time not uh she's always learning something
just so that you know i'm not schooling her formally
but i'm providing for her or educating her
little by little she knows her abc well she knows the song
yes okay you know the numbers too
just a little bit you know if i tell her one she tells me two three then the next she knows eight comes after seven you know stuff like that
yes not all of it but little by little
so you know that way
so no i'm not working but no
yes
um
well this
i did study education but they did not teach me exactly let's say how to teach a kid to read
i had to learn all those things while i was working
therefre i'm using my experience
yes but for that reason is that you know for my dad i did with with my sons
it's not a problem because i already have the experience i don't know you know like the other people does it
not outside the house
yes
yes a bit tired now but very happy
four days
yes
yes eh my parents are from the dominican republic
my name is anny
and in nineteen sixty something i don't know exactly when it was
ah i think that was the seventythree i'm not sure
but a revolution in santo domingo
and they went to live in puerto rico
then they spent twentyfive years there
then from there my sister when she went to the university she came here to the state of florida then we moved to miami
and i had like i think i was five years old
yes my sister is ten eleven years older than me
then from there we you know we stayed and
eh me i went to school here and you know we made a life here
hello arturo
and
an american
yes i met him at college
no i went
eh
so i met him there
then
after taht ah
well
it has 23 months and the other one 4 days
from miami
and what we do is that when he is not here when my husband is not at home
i speak spanish completely to my daughter
when he is here we completely speak english
and that way she will know both languages
and and me i am surprised because many times she says things
that i didn't even notice that she already learned
can be in english or spanish
she is already getting it
yes
and mm i believe that she was lets say fifteen or seventeen months
from where
like shes learning english and spanish
eh that gives up the kids who do that that gives them a little more time to speak
so my daughter caught it you know her friends or whatever her little friends
eh they would speak clearer and more than her
ah not long ago
so now her i knew she was understood and she could talk
but since she has two languages it was harder for her
yes yes
so eh but you know her i know she understood
what i was saying to her in english and spanish
philadelphia
and now you know i know especially she understands me because when she doesn't want to do something like she plays silly and you know
and i see her face and i know she understands me exactly
yes yes
so then you know she understands she speaks
and
yes and no eh we will not send her to the school yes i will teach her at home
because i was was a teacher
then i think that for me to go to work and teach them you know the children's of others for that reason i prefer staying at home
and i can teach my own children
so then
eh puerto rican
good
yes they have many here in miami programs for people that that teach their children at home
so eh normally once a week they they get together
so it's like a school it could be that that eh he has a class in a church or in a university or whatever but it's like a school that meets once a week
so that and you know too with his friends and all that y have many friends and families that have done that
mhm and and they don't have any problem
you know but also it's not something that
because that one to me that worries me also i want her to have friendships and friends and all that
yes yes
yes yes
and you
yes yes
and also you know they have the sports the the in the eh i mean the places at the community
yes you know thinks like that makes the how you say they socialize
like that you know
yes
yes eh he that one you know it is like any other experience it is like one takes you know it can be good or bad
but i also think that is common for the schools here also here the way the young people are
yes that i would also like her to have you know friends and all those things but at the same time i think i have to protect her
yes yes
yes i don´t but for that reason is that i want to teach her because i can teach anything but it depends how a present to her
ah
you know
it's a little bit different we are going to express it like it's presented at school
oh i don't know i haven't think about that he is only 2 years old
i haven't started
yes so
well it will probably will be until at least 6th grade
then from there well keel because you know i can teach here all they way to high school
oh
yes yes
well i was a special education teacher
good afternoon my name is lorena i am here in san antonio texas
porque because ahora ya son grandes ellos me han aportado bueno tantas cosas bellas no que tal vez yo misma por mi cuenta no hubiera sido suficiente para darme tantos recuerdos y tantos
positive and negative emotions eh well then not everything is beautiful not me precisely because i have a child that has some pro a health problem and that is also very painful it
and and well ehm but however they are the emotions more maybe more loving and more tender and more ehm well and the husband is there right the husband
that also has a lot a lot to do with
in in one's lie no and ehm
but yes i i would think that it can not be only one only one only event
now a painful event a painful reminder like the death of my mom for example
yes yes yes or the disease of my son also no that too
it is very painful but like i say one can't one uhm say that ust one but it is beautigul to try to think about it no
uhm yes
hola eh the the topic today is the most touching eh
exactly exactly hmm
mhm your husband you met him where
yeah because you are spanish
yeah yes
yeah
yes sure what yes yeah
yes yes and for real so many things and stages
is but well this age when they are small is so loving
mhm it is the most loving and well once they grow up they make their own life for example is really pretty but you no longer receive one like the
today mom i did very well i'am and oye mom well this is like a level of conversation like a level
exactly right now i will be the memories i said good memories are as precisely the most important one that can happen in life because one lives as memories
there is not a lot of dependency there is not a lot of closeness
this but is real nice the truth is really nice and then for you what would have been the best thing that happened to you the best memory
aha
yes
yes true it's what i also now it has been immediate i thought that like more has happened well you have very nice memories in life and the achievements you've had
well as a person in sports in or in academic life or at work no
like that exactly
exactly exactly and nevertheless you go on accumulating
memories in photographs of christmases and in the photographs of school fairs and in photographs of sports festivals of your children
it's like precisely keep on putting together this life because it's like made out of memories no
ah
m because this is like very complete you don't study to become a mom you don't study that
the human does not study to learn how to love but finally it's the most complete and deep experience
it's difficult to explain
but it's nice to have a kid because i would have hated to miss that
plenty of energy that's right
yes
yes because she for example is really active
yes yes
that's right
and then you understand why they are in that ways and everything they will accomplish with a strong and active personality
so is well i'm the best mom
she will accomplish a lot of things i believe
yes with all the hard things in front of her the challenges
well my younger daughter is like that and besides being really good in school is also an excellent athlete
her personality and having a way to
orientate it
and get tired
they need to get tired it's madness
where do you live
ah in philadelphia i have my oldest daughter studying at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia
yes yes yes it is well in philadelphia
and maybe if if i wanted to think the best thing that happened maybe it is that having had my children i remember when i was holding it when i said this is the best thing that ever happened in all my life then i
yes of course
yes but of course she's going to do it what did you study
aha aha
hmm hmm
that well is a good choice
i support you one must take many vitamins to have all the necessary energy
and you'll see how when more time passes by yes myself already my youngest daughter turned fifteen yesterday
so then when when you look back you have still many more memories many more recollections more experiences of all her achievements too which are yours because
they achieve things thanks to the support that parents can give them and to the supply of well of everything you are supplying no as you say well you're leaving aside
perhaps your more personal things your career your profession
i say be consistent with that comment that i hize myself at the time was going to have yet other things
wonderful and such can not select only one truth
yes yes yes i won't like it
my name is mariza
yes
yes and it is that no yes yes but the children the children
yes
no
sure
sure yes the death of a family member or of a loved one has to be the worst thing that can happen to someone
too
sure like the second part of the question it was that what what would it have been from his life that not if that had not happened that negative or painful event
that is that it would not be that that person would now be still for example in my case my mom is alive but my my two grandparents both of them passed away some time ago
and i didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to them because i lived far then maybe the would be what what would it have been if my life would have been different of not have because of course they couldn't meet my husband nor my daughter either
hi
so then yes
sure life would be very different
here in united states by chance
and me yes iam spanish
and i came here to study but i met him and ended staying and it has been twelve years
and nothing i have a five year old daughter i can not say that well my life has changedsure because children change your life but she is still so little that she still needs some
and then well nothing don't know is different when your children are older they became more independent but i still have to go through that
yes sure
yes the yes everyone tell me the same
yes
yes i too think cost what is the best and what is the worst
well i think that the the same as you the having kids eh well i have only one and i don't think that i don't know if i'll have more
it was no no i mean i don't think that i was ready to be a mother maybe because it was a very big change and ah the pregnancy was very difficult and the ah
the we have raised her my hus my husband and i are here on our own so it was a bit difficult but also it was of course having a child and your life changes so well it's the best then that has happened to me i say
for now
eh you can't compare anything with that i say
sure
sure and and that's why the other question was if it would have been different if that had not happened maybe if i had not been a mother my life would have been very different
i would have finished my studies all the same i would have
sure achieved a more important career or i would have traveled more or known a different person but of course you never know that you can only imagine
yes but
exactly so eh with so much time and no more passes but memories are or would not know which to choose to start
oh
exactly yes all the photographs that i have are thousands and thousands they are all of of my they are all of my daughter that's why of course the
it's easy to say that it is the most important because besides that well i have not travel that much i've met interesting people but i don't know if their comparable with
with kids i guess
no
yes that's what i say to my sister she doesn't have children i say to her that she is going to be a complete women until she becomes a mother
i say complete because my sister and her husband have been married for 20 years but they don't have kids and i don't think they'll ever have so well it's difficult to explain
yes it's difficult to explain you are nothow do they say
i have a child because of that i get to my thirties i said that was about time it was now or never because
for raising a child you have to have plenty of patience and energy plenty of
for example the best
my daughter requires plenty of patience and sacrifice
and
she is really active she is not like i was as a child i was more quiet i always did what my parents told me to be
she is like that sometimes
i end up tired after everyday but well she is like that you have to accept your children as they are
and
that's what i think and hope for her
yes i compare her with my nephew they are so different i think that my daughter has a stronger personality and that might help her to get better things in the future
of course
exactly that's what we want we want our daughter to get into some sport but maybe we should wait to get her a little older because 5 years old seems a little to young for me
yes i too
she has the body for being and athlete and that might help her to develop more
yes
she might get quieter
i really need that sometimes we hit the bed earlier than she we just can t do it more
i don't know someone tells me it's their age
right now we are in philadelphia
oh what a coincidence it is a good university
yes yes here it is a city where many people come to study many young people one of the most important ones which is another important thing education
eh and right
of course i would like for my daughter to also go to university but i have many years left for that
ok
me criminal justice well psychology but i didn't finish my degree
well after i got pregnant the child we want to raise her at home we don't want to take her to a daycare because we want don't know it's the most traditional way how i was raised they had me in each my parents they looked after me
we don't want to leave her on her own in a daycare so in the
yes yes it's good eh
yes as long as it's possible right now yes yes yes and
wow
yes
i was thinking that clear and also wondered if i had not thought of that as his life had been different if you have not had their children
is is
hello my name is juan
hmm i don't i haven't paid a lot of attention to those ratings
in the end i don't understand them very well either
i think they're a little complicated they should have instead a little more information about what they have
but since i don't have small children anymore
eh kids i don't worry too much
about those ratings i worry when we go to watch a movie that it's a movie that's worth it that has something of interest not any movie then the rating
doesn't interest me as much as the quality and opinions i hear about the movies
that's that's what draws my attention a little i don't know if the same happens to you do you go alone or with someone else
yeah
yeah
nice to meet you too where are you
aha
ah yes
yes
ah
aha
yes
yes
there is always something
if it had nothing to do with it
yes yes i think that in that sense you may have a point
ah where are you
ah for me how curious
what i worry about most in movies is the language and violence
regulary because like you say when there is an exxageration in the language
o in the violence of most equal
so when the movies like so r well evidently they will have scenes of that type
those are free and so betterr they seem more restrictive like you don't have much information of the movie are exxagerated in all of the elements
yes
mhm
yes see that
recalling the movies that we had seen lately all of them are
aha
pg thirteen or something like that i don't know where it came from because we had them here
there not available at the theaters
there there no good
then no we worry a lot because of the informacion since my sons are adolescents we always go together to the theater but
we mostly go for the quality of the movie then
he in that sense the classification has to be for orientation about the movie since they really don't give information no
we don't take then into account
mhum
yes
yes i see
ah okay i'm in texas in san antonio
what
yes
here it those cases for the education of our kids
we have never censored anything
what we have done it's commenting the scenes if they are strong scenes
we comment them and we decide if it was strong or not only it's when we are worried
we analize it and then take something to educate our children
in general it works for us because or it worked for u no now they are grown now
and what happens at this time is that they have very good judgement over the movies no and
oh i see
aha that's where i'm mhm
oh i see
yes
yea
yes
of course
yes no and the thing is that they will encounter it in life they will always have the opportunity to see all of that
but what is what speaking of those things is that censorship or information that that supposedly should be censored or
that sort of thing i have never thought it was good because
there is a lot of other information about movies that are good to watch with your family
and then after the movie talk about what happens and educate them around this type of movie the message the quality with which it was made and so on and so on
no yes
because the restrictions they place man like you say there is violence that is eh in cartoons
there are cartoons that are for kids and they have an exaggerated violence no
aha exactly and the and in the and in general i think that eighty per cent of the movies are so bad that you shouldn't watch them
no and of the other well maybe some are mediocre and less that five per cent are worth watching
no but with those you have enough to have a an idea of what is what you're looking for no
there is enough it doesn't mean that they don't make enough movies but they make so many that you don't have to go and watch all of them it's it's
no and then
if we try for example to eh know who they are before going to a movie to inform ourselves
about the critics about that movie and then we go
that's not that's what we try to do when we go to watch this movie
aha
we already have made a decision about the movies and since my children since they were small they have they have had and education because we really like the movies my wife and i love the movies so
never even when we were they were little
if there was a movie sometimes we would take them even if it was for and older age than theirs no
and they could see some scenes no stronger but a scene doesn't necessarily make up the whole movie
then we tried to talk about the message no for example many war movies no
many war movies are for example respecting the soldi
aha ah
well my name is claudia ivette who am i talking too
more like pg pg pg13 i've noticed that
so i don't really understand it
yeah
yeah
yes it's true
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
no i'm married i've been married for 3 years and i do have a child he's 20 months old
oh nice to meet you juan
then he's just a little under 2 years old and i am worried about what we do well my husband more than anything
for example if we watch a movie and we love to do that we like the movie if it's pg or pg13
which is what most see we do not really like him or his adult movies
it's pc13
it's like this sometimes but the truth strikes us if there is a movie that we like
sometimes we buy it and it has some nude scenes in it i grab my husband and he deletes that part
and what makes it more important that neither my husband and i are going to keep it is because the kids can get a hold of the movie and see it
and my husband is going to burn the commercial or something
then you can really watch the movie because you will not see better pure truck action
but for example you just delete the part that has a little pornography because the movie is a good but it has some nude time
where from excuse me
and sometimes it has nothing to do with it
we have movies that have cars and action and suddenly something happens that has nothing to do with it
then we will have to wait because we have other children then so we have to be sure that we're alone before we can see the movie
no there won't be a problem but
yes
yes
eh yes because really
yes
yes
no yes
ah i'm here in idaho
yes no yes in part for example we have found movies that are for that are for children these aren't for children but to see
passing for the children that are supposedly pg thirteen that are for children of thirteen years that can see them well the vocabulary and sometimes there are scenes
of nudity and so i say it is like they are seeing well
i don't know i am mexican
still for example on the television they protect you also in the movies they still protect you a bit
but i say um i don't know i don't know its very
very fast mhm
mhum mhum
mhum
no yes
this place is called robert where are you calling from
mhum
yes
no sometimes they don't tell you anything because sometimes for example they say
and they change for example the things and when you are already seeing it is different from what they said
oh for example it ways that is really violent sometimes it isn't that violent it doesn't provide the real information
so sometimes doesn't
not even myself put attention because of those examples
those things they sell for example those commercials on television
they remove all the bad words on tv sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't well i don't have one really
but i have a friend with one of those things and she says sometimes it works but other times removes words it should not remove and leave the really bad words
wow a little far away
so
yes
yes
yes
yes yes
yes
yes
yes notice that it is true that is the best idea that i remember of my mom when we would watch a movie anyways we didn't see a movie after ten at night because
we knew that we would be able to find
or my mom would risk seeing bad movies
yes yes well you see we have to speak about movies
of the type that is not appropriate for some kids but for example sometimes she would say they wouldn't show a movie and i don't know any other one then some vulgar thing
or something that is not as naked but it is the same for example small amounts of clothing and when we were girls for example my mom
no daughter well you guys will already understand more and she would tell us
because anyways if one says to not turn around you shouldn't see that then like to an adolescent or to a child it will begin to sink in and but why doesn't my mom let me
if it is a movie of the house and i am going to see because my mom doesn't let me see that part
so then i think not yes yes
yes
no yes i believe that
yes
yes yes it's true
well i really don't know much about movie classification i don't really understand it i know that there are some movies that are pg13 pg
aha
uh yes and that is not so much in the light of day really
yes not anymore
yes
yes
that's right
that's right
aha
yes
aha
i really have watched some that have lots of bad words on it and they are pg13 eh eh they are kind of violent and more
aha
yes
aha
aha
yes
good good evening i'm joe
always here aware of what she watches i don't want her to see programs that that will give her nightmares or bad ah motivations but there are many
many permissive things also like for example the movies out well each time are more i think now they are move violent i don't know if
already sufficient in order to classify it because violent movies with many themes come out
yes
clearly
clearly
like that movie that is allied it already came out of the war in iraq and i believe it's about the soldiers that their experience
there is this actor of color jamie he's called i think jamie foxx
and so there is another white guy that seems is traumatized or something when he is in his experience in iraq those things are very real and that happens there every day
and yes true
joe
yes
yes transferring many things outside of the lie that he told in order to invade iraq which is really now that one looks at it well really
it is not worth having done that and already two thousand soldiers have died
yes it's true
yes it's true well i think that classifications now are really relative i know they have from pg13 the have the r rated which
are obvious right but i think that the r rating is not very well defined about they can or can't have i agree that
many movies right don't make any sense for example there are many gangster movies so many of the real gangster go and watch it because they
need to see violence
yes really bad
and glorifies it in a way
yes and what's your name
and that is not for sale
because some younger boys start dressing the same or walking of talking the same they watch because it's like a hero
that's not right it corrupts the young people those programs those movies they teach wrong values and that is not good but also
society parents families they have a lot of the work in helping children to understand those things right my kid when she
when i'm watching something like that if i don't want i mean i don't force it in that ways saying like okay don't watch that
or i try in a educational way to teach her why this show isn't good for her instead of forcing her en other words
mm
oh yes
yes it's easy
yes
alex where are you from
yes exactly at home i have the basic cable so there is not a channel which is over the line
no i have a five year old girl
then there is a disney channel she really likes to watch we also watch discovery channel she likes it and there is also other
comedy show which isn't over the line that we both watch she likes to laugh she likes the funny things
but when there are somethings over the line well i don't let her watch those things because i don't want her to learn some bad things
this is made when it isn't morally or socially correct
yes e
the culture is more
the videos
yes all of those things
oh yes yes yes of course i remember i remem
yes
yes
the teenage years are a critical age
exactly
it's just that the way of reasoning and thinking they say we were teenagers too i remember how i acted back then in
that i had my rebellious spirit and all that but it's when you need your parents' guidance the most
yes and if one comes to see it is how when they are alone with their little friends they can watch what they want since there is no one to forbid it
eh but if one helps him by setting a good foundation in in regard to what is good and what is bad that helps him a lot to think before acting
taking a wrong action
exactly
eh what a memory yes yes i remember of course
yes
and they think they are more independent that they don't need their parents
yes
yes the influence of young people nowadays is very large i i agree although i remember i also had my my influence from friends when when i was a kid an all that
but i can see that because of the technology and all that stuff well it is even greater because really the movies from the time when i was a kid were not as violent as they are now
there were no video games television was much more restricted no none of this modern violence was shown at all not the blood and the body like in csi and all those shows that are pict classics
that show stuff as if they were real
well what it does is that the adolescent brain gets used to seeing those things as it grows these things are learned and it has caused chaos
in fact it wasn't permitted in all cases but it is true the mentality is changing and because of this eh the youth have a great influence
large and negative that these things are permitted in society and i well
i'm from colorado ah denver colorado
i i believe that when my daughter gets to the time of of adolescence that i am there
yes i know time goes quickly
i remember when she was a baby and now she is jumping and running all around and learning many new things and is curious and asks a lot of questions
well what do you think of tonight's topic
yes me too i don't pay too much attention to the classification besides i'm in a class of adult no of course i have a daughter that
yes good evening
yes no i think that i am interested in the movies and the television through the theme that it has
now it is a violent theme and it has no quality and it is not a good movie but yes it is a bit violent and it is teaching us something
like a documentary or something about life then has value
because one can not deny the truth of life
one can not live life with blind eyes
yes
and those movies can also be political critiques
of the bush administration perhaps it has always been an administration obsessed with war
with iraq and fooling the public
this people are important because many people are really ignorant in the things that happens in the their live
what's your name
because there is not information
the information we have is propaganda so it's important to look for the other information about what's happening around the world no only the bush administration side of the coin
mm
those movies are bad
because they teach violence
yes and they don't make them for values it just for sellng
to certain people
uh so do i i have a fourteen year old soon
and each time he comes visit i have to setup parental control on sex channels
because he is obsesed with that each time i go to work he is watching that
joe
tehn when i setup the parental controls he is unable to watch them but he is controlled only because i wanted to place those parental controls
not because ratings then is the work of each mom and dad to control what their children are watching is not fair to blame the classifications
do you have teenagers
oh a girl
yes you can teach your kids but the reality is that we as parents can't stay with our eyes closed specially when
they are growing because they will have more temptations than the ones we had
not because we're good parents but because the culture
because the culture nowadays with teenagers they're more ah gangs ah hip hop music lots of sex lots of violence
the videos
and ah it's not easy to control all of that you try to and you i tried to explain him what i the consequences of what can happen if he gets into all of that
alex
if he does that if he has sex with a girl there can be lots of consequences that that he can hav that can happen you know
you have to uh talk with them constantly because some things i've seen with parents because i i'm a substitute teacher in the schools
they take care of their kids really well when they're five six seven eight nine ten years old but when they're growing up and need the most help the parents are doing i don't know what
they start to fail and these kids have lots of temptations and
and at that age when you're a teenager is when you have to get into life more and the kid
no just when you're five or six years old
e exactly exactly therefore everything depends on the education of the parents the the way in which they are involved in the life of the children and not not on the not on the classifications
a classification is only a number
yes
you have to give the boys foundations about what is good and what is bad not just when they are five or six years old but also when they are fifteen sixteen eighteen years old
ah eh i'm here in los angeles i think we spoke before about religion
and it is more important when they are fifteen years old than when they are five since when they are five they are going to follow rules easily
but when they are already fourteen or fifteen years old it's another friend
yes now they have friends now they are already involved in the culture
the father or the mother have to work they don't always have time it is very difficult
mmm
yes
yeah it will be soon my friend
time flies
we spoke the fourth of october it's been some time now
where are you from again
oh yes yes
ah i watch television based on quality not not classifications
hello marisa is carolina from here from los angeles
is tough is
the topic i was dying i was saying
why why
but okay thank god you are not alone i listen many people saying they don't talk but rant of him and i say
certainly people are realizing besides of
they think people are so stupid that they are not going to
tell about the stupid things they are doing for god sake
sure
sure look yes and you know that recently here finished the film festival and latin american
and by the way the presented a movie eh from argentina but the director were spanish
and so so interesting because you know the spanish films have many protest movies a film of
heavy and including i don't know if you just so happen to know if you know a website called eh tv for all
documentary kind eh where
and there you can watch television channels
from all over the countries of the world including spain
aha it's called like something t v uh t uh t v four
yeah four four and all a l l as in television for everybody something like that
there well there you can watch well we sometimes like to we've been watching this particular venezuelan channel
and it's a channel where supposedly the state but actually now the state it's not like it used to from the state but it wasn't like
and so then we can eh actually watch the true what is going on there what they never talked about and especially that our president is a rather
like we say here in venezuela clear and refreshing
eh well well here is good afternoon
uh i don't know if you have had the opportunity to listen to it before
exactly exactly we
aha it's the same here
it's pretty much the same in here
but you know those people unfortunately well i mean they show what they want
exactly exactly
correct that's right they even change the facts
they change the facts of what's happening and so i always come across people that say for example they tell me what do you think about that crazy president of yours and
i oh dear mother they've hit the jackpot well the truth is that i agree with that crazy man ah well what i meant to say is that
i wanted to say that they use it to say a lot of crazy things right
oh i said good heavens how is it going to be hey today we had a hard topic
and oh my god i had to be patient because it's a tricky subject
so i've even had some problems here with people from venezuela
ah people that have been living here for a long time and they don't know what's really going on in venezuela
and apart from that they are afraid of the idea that they have been sold that communism that i don't know how long fidel and that and the other
well i don't know really you have so much knowledge but for example the situation that we are living in venezuela is very special
very peculiar for venezuela nothing to do with the cuban reality with what happened in cuba they had to
adopt that system eh which necessities forced them to assume that system and what happened during the time in
which they were applying that because there were mistakes like with everything else as we have also made some mistakes right now
we have been making mistakes but we are working on that as the president says he has a complain against the
government not against the country but against the governmet from here they are the ones
oh dear because i'm from venezuela
who assume the policies that they want as they want arbitrarily eh
exactly
exactly correctly so and if not i blackmail you
aha then wow eh
exactly exactly it is a very very situation
delicate but i believe and from what i have seen i feel that north americans like in some way are like waking up i feel
that there are a few more people that are like realising what is really happening because also they're kept like in a bubble
yes
you're right
you're right
where are you from
yeah labels follow and bad ones too
that's right
exactly that's what they say to me sometimes  what are you doing here
i tell them look i could be in venezuela and not support the president i mean the fact that you are in
country or not i mean if you left your country that doesn't mean that you're taking a position
nobody knows the reasons for the people to be there
in eh at some point nothing to do with the opposition because how many people in venezuela do not live in venezuela and what they are doing is complaining
to the venezuelan government and the people
so so don't have to be here or there to support or not to support so it is a very very it makes me laught when they tell me that
because what are you doing here and well same as you thank goodness you are here no in venezuela
oh okay
correct correct rightlook with all the problem about the petrol that is has been but look
in a susprisingly big way the people can not take it anymore but they don't protest and i say my gd but what happens with the people so
supposedly when it affects your pocket then you react but it doesn't seem like that i don't knows what is happening do they change cars and buy a more economic onei don't know
i don't know what happens but they don't have in general they don't have that need to protest on some issues
but i tell you i don't know suddenly here you are in pennsylvania you told me
in philadelphia i don't know but i feel that there's a bit more of that people is starting to wake up
i feel like they are rejecting policies the policies from our current president and they are looking at things the wrong way they are presenting them to them like
me too at the beginning i had no access to that and that website was like my god is it true what they are saying there in venezuela but i would talk to my friends and
and they would say no girl what's that look i that's a lie but you see the power of television is
very big well speaking of that power
and and you know that now we are living a very critical moment precisely with the united states and the our new president
and television has a huge power
sure
that's right
yes yes yes yes
sure sure what are you doing there in philadelphia
okay
oh and you like it there more than miami
okay okay
right right and fi and here what you do
okay okay
and then oh dear
okay whatever you get right
but from how you've been around here in united states
twelve
ay mother i have six here and we are about to return if god lets us
yes right so
yes sir right so and
yes
ah oh my god
yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes you see and i would also get into that game but now i understand that it's not like that we are not we are not
wow
to blame for what our government does
so i would also look at american people and would treat them badly but now i have understood that they are not to blame and that they are people from the united states they are not americans that's a badly understood term isn't it so
well we are american too if that's the case
and and so i started to think of that and no no they are not north americans no it's the government oh well they do
they decide they do so sure it does reflect the people of the country
but it's not like that the state it's the politics the government
sure
of course of course yes no and you have you have the right precisely for being in a democracy you have the right to protest
i oh exactly exactly not me i hope this the the
not affected anything the eh the that linguistic project but at least is a really controversial topic when i listened
hello my name is name is marisa from philadelphia
of the of the united states really is
yes
mhm
it's very str
no
ah yeah
t v for all oh
oh
mhm
mhm
mhm
well i think that yes yes on television and after that the peaks of america and everything that was happening over there
hello good evening
yes yes they put it up in there in philadelphia there are several hispanic channels like telemundo univision
galavision and all that stuff
and you can listen to everything yes and
it's not like that happens here too it's controlled by the government i mean let's say
eh we only hear what they want us to hear
mhm
mm
yes
mm
yes
oh that's right is three hours ahead yes
mhn
yes sure
sure
yes well no they have become the world police they are the ones who become the
bosses of all and and tell you what is going to happen and if you don't agree then the hard way you have to agree
mhm exactly
with embargo with with whatever the hard way with violence ay with war
this
uh huh
they still miss a lot and that that's what makes me
very hard yes
makes me angry because it's very clear well if you know that two plus two equals four and you see how people are manipulated
and you try to say that to someone  look this is how it is this and this didn't you realize then they say no to you because you were
liberal or communist or i mean well you
they label you and
bad you're bad yeah you're a terrorist or you're anti anti get out of here we don't want you if you don't like it
and i say but this country the bad isn't the country it's the leaders of the country
yes
mhm
sure
mm
mm
yes
no but he it is the same in spain but it is different leftwing government but even a rightwing it is another mentality because when the
people does not agree takes the streets and and make demonstrations and you don't see that here i have never seen it
oh mhm
yes
yes
yes philadelphia yes
mm
yes
power yes
i'm spanish
yes they control us i mean yes here
eh here in philadelphia we are a democratic city everyone here is democrat but the rest of the state are republicans and the people the people from the united states they they tell you things
i don't know very radical
very dangerous so close oh yeah so
he can't it's not going to change so while that changes well
i oh well i live here with my husband we moved here from florida about a year ago we used to live in florida and
here looking for work we finished moving and
we're in process of mm well i liked that more what happens is that him the work issues is a lot better here in north there in south is a lot more saturated
and what you're going to do works is first first place
he is eh he works in the pharmaceutical industry doing clinical research ah
well
and i look i work as administrative ah voluntary and
mostly what whatever i encounter right
well like twelve years
mhm
yes when i got here they had bill clinton and the country was like it was in like a incredible phase with lots of work every one happy the economy was going up
afterwards the republicans got in eh with bush and it all started to fall down like they say
it's going to hell little by little it's i don't know the world when i'm in spain
when i go to spain everybody the my husband is american and people look at him in anger they have lots of hard feelings against them they tell him look your country is
destroying the world they are taking over everything and
you think you feel you think that you know you own the world and
yes
there are lots of hard feelings of their power
sure
aha
sure
mhm
and i don't like that i'm like i'm from spain and i'm american and i here need it would seem that i like it but i
eh and i have to wait and have to wait what he does government but i don't know either i don't like it he is a
of course well but theory practice don't say anything or else
mm it is like a regime yes
very
yes well something similar happens to me what i have to say about the united states is also not very positive because ah mm i'm also not from the left anyways so well
me
i say i am going to speak about bush because see that i have a lot a lot of anger that i have to speak about bush and leave to him bad because
yes yes yes
that is that
mhm
no stupid things and then and and everybody takes takes the hands to the head oh my god this can't be true anything
and not to the next week they forget the situation because
the newspapers and the tv they show you other thing let's say to to to distract something to distract then people forget
mhm
mhm
mercedes speaking
mmh
and some time did you have a difficult break up
yes
it is always difficult
mm
mmh
that's good
i mean you've only had two boyfriends
that's good better why why involve yourself in problems
when there's no necessity
from honduras
well i haven't had a date in a long time i don't go through that but i think i've had a difficult experience before
i was with this guy yea with my first boyfriend we were together for two years
mm i remember we just chose to stop dating i don't remember when though
but um this was ten years ago
i was nineteen he was eighteen
yea
and after we well we stop seeing each other after it was not easy because
after with another guy who i used to go out with we went out a few months also he did not live where i did where
we were in the university where we were and he went back to his country of origin
and that one was also easy because by done one stops seeing him and rapo that is is easy well right
mhm
in that manner
eh what else let's see what else after that i had no other formal boyfriend until smore then for real the experiences that i never had any maneexperience like i do not even know right thank god
mhm
mhm
yes
right
yes
uh um
thank god
you say that it's nothing well everything can be perfect it's true always and also
ah from where
because there's people who are mistaken there's people that thinks oh marriage is the it's according to the time of uh and it's all peacefulness
but you live with the people day and night and you look at the peop i mean
it's impossible to maintain a right a situation like that like
if you always love the person well it's impossible for it to be only peace that's what i'm saying right
because one because i i'm one it's human and one has to things that very upset other people right and
see to anyone alse well i'm not saying the person you're with particularly but anyone else what do i know
eventually well like that we have a saying no not everyone's penny all the day twentyfour hours a day for every other day well
yes
hmm
and to treat
oh how nice
yes yes
hmm
yes
oh no yes that bu and what what is ehm ironic is that ehm those are usually the ones that there are times that those are relationships that are more difficult
for that for the people that are in involved in that type of relationship
because usually well ehm people do when one is in that type of situation it is there is like a selfconfidence that is too low
and then they think in that that people think that this is what is the best that i'm going to be able to some time ehm what i will be able to get
i have to put up with it i have to continue putting up with it since
and then ehm it really that it is not so easy like on thinks that oh he already did this i am going to send him to the tubes no
it is difficult rather because uhm it becomes like no is like it not to say addict but if to the to that type of situation in which
and you where are you from
the drama is __ it is ehm a lot right and and then people don't know how to leave that cycle of of abuse right that is what happens
yes but
mhm
ah
mhm
oh
oh no
ah from where the city eh capital
and what do you think about today's subject what if it's more eh it's easier to break up with someone young or or if the age makes a difference
uh huh
well my name is ibet with whom do i have the pleasure
i feel that it's difficult when you really love the person when really you don't love her i think that it's like anything okay it's fine let's break up okay
each for their own part
the i believe that when you really love the person but in this case i imagine that it is because you didn't get along with the person
or or because really i don't know maybe they didn't want to get along between the between the two people i believe that there must be more than anything
a communication in relationships
i mean between in the relationship and if there is one une of the two parts starts to lose the there is going to be lack of trast and starts
to deteriorate the communication then i believe that can can cause a break but yes i know that i feel that it hurts
mm well eh really yes yes yes because for example before i married my husband eh i was with someone and for example eh
in any case not very long time but the first my first boyfriend
then this
hi mercedes how are you where are you from mercedes
i lasted a bit of time with him it was not long but it was the first illusion i had i don't know and and i already was i had said well and i even said no well i am going to marry him
eh i am going to have three children and i was already building castles on air when one time he cane and said you know what not i here it ends
how
i believe there was he had more experience of saying here it stops what do i say uh then i believe that for him uhm
it was not so difficult but for me yes
and after that now yes everything was for the better because after that i met who is now my husband and wow it is much better
the truth
so i don't know
yeah that's right
what about you
oh from honduras
yeah and how did it happen to you
ha
ha
ha
wow
are you married
oh
yeayea
yeah
yeah
wow my brotherinlaw's wife is from honduras too
yes
yes
yeah noyes is that sometimes don't know well for example i believe that in in my case eh with the first person i think that i had too many feelings for
well it was a lot
more then the the of then he fell for i believe with and it was not a long time i think that it was two or three months
but same i was flying because they said ah this is my first boyfriend and i would probably marry him and that stuff
and inand he i think he did not think the same he said well her i do not know if i was his third or forth fifth don't know
but i said yes well i'm not gon na marry her i'll just hang with her and meet her and that's it instead well i think i was the one who made illusions about that
and yeah it really hurts
er yes it hurts because i think that you're excited and you have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and says'no' well it just
ah no no eh i don't know but i know that she is honduran too
but i think there must be it must hurt a lot more when you're living with that person as a marriage
i thing that must be the worst experience i think of your life yes and i hope i hope i never have it because we don't know right
then i hope i never until now i've been married for three years and everything is working well not perfect but everything's fine
a lot of communication and stuff like that
yes
no
yes
no yes
yes
yes
yes she is
that's it
yes the truth me bein i think it has to be something for real eh very hard eh keeping it everything happy right but
and i think that also that and i think that huh when you're in your relationship for example you can know and as you meet the person
that of course you aren't meeting him profusely right until you're already married with that person but it's but i think that i think that
if you see that really you don't get on with that person and for example i've met people eh that hit their boyfriends being boyfriends they hit them and treated them bad and forced them to everything they wanted then
i think this relationships are never going anywhere good because if they aren't married then
and they already treat them like that how is it going to be when they're married as soon they're going to say you're my owner
yeah how they treat them then i think that that one that those relationships eh i think they're never going to work i don't know or either he changes or
or he changes or the relationship is over like that i think that if it is a relationship like that well i i think it shouldn't hurt at all on the contrary off
you should rest if you have a boyfriend that hits you or something
i'm from mexico
you are going to rest you are going to say ah that's great that we finished i don't know and i think that if for example everything starts to get along and all
everything is wonderfully and all of a sudden someone i don't know has go to for example to another country or needs to go to another school i think that there it would also hurt a little
because everything is fine but only for third circumstances since they must separate then i think that in that type of relationship well it does it does hurt but if it is a relationship like that that
that they hit you and things like that then no
that yes
aha
yes
that is true
that yes yes yes true you are right because
for example one time in when i was in mexico i met a girl that eh one time came with some black lenses to her jo job
from the city yes from mexico city yes and
and i told her and now you with glasses was cloudy the day really and she had a hit that her boyfriend did to her
and i told her you should i told her i believe you can't allow i don't know i told her but i think you can't allow him to touch you
your boyfriend and she said well it is it is too difficult to end the relationship with him and i told her why she says
in spite of everything i love him
and then wow i gave what how can be possible that you love to some person that hits you that beats you sometimes she came eh bruised or sometimes eh
he gave her slaps or something like that
then like you say sometimes that kink of relationships are the hardest and at the end when she could do it i remember that she was the one that cried and cried and cried any
any time she could cry in the breaks and such things because she missed him and so on then i believe yes in some way sometimes eh
some relationships i believe that i imagine that to her was very painful
mm look okay i already passed that stage and i'm now married but for example ah mm well i don't know the experience that i had was was very difficult
fabiola
yes i know some people from maracaibo
eh yes yes
you and i are you arepa
yes
i know a know a girl from venezuela that lives in houston
no no no no no in houston in the
texas no no no i work from home in my house
do you work
oh
that's a great job
fine and you
yes but it gives you satisfaction to have
the power to help the people
there i learned the alphabet in in
yes yes
but with signs
here they taught my daughter the alphabet eh some words
not all some like i love you and stuff
yes little words
but beautiful
what do they speak
in washington yes
without listening but let them speak let them
ah
that's so nice
that's a tough job for parents to do
and what do you think about today's subject about the
yes sure i think that it must have something more than love because love
is aquired by time
and and with win then i believe that you would want to keep a family you have to want a family because there is many people that love
and they are so young the first thing the think of whrn they get the opportunity is fight and separate
they don't work hard and they love they love each other maybe more then a couple that has been married thirty years
and you
but they fight day in and out and they pass problems they pass on top of the problems
and i believe that is what is needed people today to have patience yn
think whether you decided to stay with that person or marry that person
well it is forever now even when there are problems to not get out running on the first problen that you find
and me twelve
yes
me too
i wouldn't have cared about anything but
ah i say like that that if i fall i get up again what is the problem
but now i think about it three times
uf
ah of course i do the same
oh my god
it hasn't happened to me i haven't gotten to that
it was the pride
if that doesn't work at all
affects only
candy is as ready to throw in the towel
clear
yes
mm no isa girl and sometimes they are treated well but not love
extremes
are pass all their lives together
no they just respect each other and
and what they wanted to was to form a family and that's it
no and there are others that say love if there is not love there isn't anything
because of course nobody forces you you want to be there and and you fight and to keep yourself ___
you might have a partner it is difficult when you have one you have t
the most difficult thing after that is to maintain it
but no is that the time comes in which you know the same but the important thing is that you can get out of it
and that the system leads you to that just the same
no he's from here
chilean
so easy i say
for well for some things easier
for some
yes i think for me is easier because sometimes they are more entertaining because i don't understand what he says then it doesn't go well no didn't have a reason to fight
a lot with him because i find it funny
what are you saying oh when we were super
ehh chillan chile
from maracaibo
carolina
no no why you know people there
oh i see i see well you know they have a strong accent right like you and i mm
aha
ah yes yes yes oh good that's good sometimes is hard to find people from venezuela they say no no we really know only a few people from venezuela and this and that and i oh my god
only a few live here but in around ten um mm in the past ten years i think the number has grown
mhm
mhm oh do you work at the hilton
ah i thought you had said hilton ah oh my god oh okay okay
okay okay perfect
yes i work with deaf children
whats up fabiola how are you mm
aha well right now i'm really working with parents with deaf children mhm
yes yes it's hard
yes
exactly exactly and the same thing happened in venezuela only it was done with sign language
okay okay chilean of course no
mhm
correct but here it's oral
okay
mhm
mm okay
well well where are you
yes yes yes now i am it is in the oral part no i am like in the other extreme of the of the
of the profession because this is here they encourage the kids to speak
mhm
yes no yes they have they can hear through hearing devices
so they do they train you so that you can recognize the sounds
mhm mhm yes yes it's like a possibility that they have they can speak they won't speak perfectly you will notice the difference but
but they will have that option so some parents even mix the sign language with the oral part right it depends on the
hearing loss level of the kid if it's a deep loss where you are not able to have that possibility even with the best surgery so there
eh they use sign language as a complement
mhm it's a huge job it really is it's tough but it's it's rewarding at the end of the day they are rewarded sure they have to work really hard as we say
oh mother too far away
otherwise well they will hardly make it
oh well it's an incendiary subject it really is well i think that couple relationships are not simple you have to deal with someone that
it's different to you that comes from another world another culture another way of living and you have to work together for a common project like
ah sometimes it's quite hard right i think that love is the only thing that help us get over the difficulties just that
if there's love if there's a will of the couple to overcome all those differences then this problems that they could face over time
well they will overcome them do you agree
mhm
sure
mhm
correct
i'm in los angeles
sure
correct
yes
sure
surewell note that i mm my husband we have have almost eight years of marriage
and twelve imagine and and for real we have had well two critical moments at the point of separation and there came a time that maturity set in it plays an important role no
i in other moment of my life i would have left
aha
i wouldn't have cared about anything anything but look not even a bit
exactly
yes
of course then now really i think about it and say no but he has other things i mean i i focus on the good things he has i say he is different than me he can not think like me and i don't have a reason to get upset if he doesn't think like me
but neither do i want to let that affect me
no i mean exactly then fortunately well eh the first time was rather horrible because i thought it was the end of the world and well there we were and we lasted a good time that we were not dealing with each other until one day i said well but what is happening
we have we had almost three weeks never in life had we lasted three weeks without without talking to each other and sleeping on the same bed
mm horr horrible horrible i told him loo you know what yes it seems to me
listen no terrible a great immaturity on our part really i told him you know it seems to me that this is a trunk of immaturity
we don't have i mean this doesn't make sense if you want to continue with the project we continue if you don't have to continue we don't continue it i love you
i love you but we can not continue like this because you go on one side and i go to another and really believe me that i love you and because i love you
it is that i need for us to define this because it is stupid on our part to live like this in addition a place like this god doesn't bless so
let's get the batteries because regardless of however serious the situation might be which fortunately was not a serious thing but umm as if neither both wanted to twist the arm
we are just extremes good and where you from
the foolish pride because it
for nothing all the opposite
exactly then well fortunately we take up again the course and then had another and yet this was lower i think that was really the first part that we
and was well well what's more i was ready as we say here about candy i said nothing ends here
yes ready to throw in the towel i said nothing no no no no i will not i will allow i say do not allow it i say do not permit it i mean you are wrong
if anything i learned in this life is to find solutions for things that can be
because we're going to do with a mediocre relationship i do not want a mediocre relationshipas you say people who spend up to thirty years together that's a pigs relationship
that they are treated badly no piece of that thing what is that that i want
accurate well
yes yes yes look is that they spend thousands of things of truth so much happens in couples it is a very interesting topic because you say
from where
there are really people looking they take it super of the best but do not want as good i used to live with it
exactly
exactly there are others that don't there are others that defi definitely do whatever they feel like doing and w and they maintain a good image
there isn't anything there isn't anything it really must be a great a great love that's why i say because i feel that in my relationship what could was love
because to tell you the truth with a situation so so difficult like the one we live in if there wouldn't have been love right there there wouldn't have it no it would have ended as simple as that because it really did not make any sense
it didn't make sense to continue something that eh where there was no love so i feel that yes lots of love and a lot of that compromise that you talk about of loving for real
to be there because you want to because it is worth it
exactly exactly
exactly
su that is the most difficult thing yes it is and to look for like to be constantly in that ehm ehm in that harmony that that like about new things of let's do this differently let's do now to not fall in that routine
oh chilean ok im fromo venezuela
ehm
exactly of course it is to realize it
sure sure your husband is chilean as well
oh imagine that is a little bit more i mean is not that is harder really i think that love can conquer all
you think is easier
oh okay okay because my husband is from venezuela and
and sometimes i say i think that has nothing to do with the nationality i think those are universal things
and what what was it you told me
bad
that's funny
and how do get to idaho
ah right idaho
well my mom married a gringo
yesthen that is why we came went to seattle in ninety one i was elen years then
but my dad stayed in chile and because that i go and fly like this
sure
and to
interesting
one like that i am like we live together
then sure
yes well more or less in the for example i'm here all of two thousand three
yes because i am within the city it is more city maybe i am from city or from the field for example i lived in san rafael do not know if you place yourself but
road from san felipe to the andes it is like the question more more rural and you can not imagine how
typical chilean field and i loved that
like a village what do i know oh i like being within the city what do i know more cool what know more things to do
hmm i don't know what bothers me is
then
yes
but
yes i can imagine
sure
and what's it called and of course then i went and came back but more or less the ninetyone yes and you
sure
yes i can imagine
the contact is difficult too
ah it's not so much for nothing for nothing
and from santiago surely
of course
oy i lived
of course there in santiago i lived the and in concepción
of course
yes exactly sounds good
hello
because no i don't know what i wrote the monday to do
and i didn't know anything else about that
i mean hello yea
oh i hope my phone doesn't start acting up again
no but i meant it has been it has been taking calls what do i know
well i started again and they called me four times but i only answered once
yes
well uh
of course why not
i'm telling i've been
hello hello how are you
having fun giving a theme for
no ah yes that must be
i thought i used to think that this was like this this this study to make like a phone menu an things like that
well for hospitals and theaters and things like that and then they wanted for people to talk things regarding health and things like that for example
ah because union shouldn't of because one does not want to do it
ah
ah of course ah ya
ah ok i thought because it was part of the study that they wanted to hear words in spanish or in castilian what do i know
no but no
of course with
ah from idaho very well i am alicia from atlanta
of course it is the fruit
yes
no it's no that good in idaho right now
i was in washington around the seattle area when i first got to the united states of course
and that i'm in georgia i'm south i'm good as well because the band is all here where i live in atlanta and
go ahead and set it here
but idaho is such a rural state so no
yes i guess the same is not dependent
oh yeah i guess oh the thing is that i'm in atlanta and it's a fairly large city supposedly the life here should be really fantastic
two or three years
yes
also because of all of the businesses and the bars ant the clubs that have to close in the morning
at two in the morning all are closed
well the reason is that the area like that and thing in atlanta it is called buckhead
and like and already like two three years ago there was crime and stuff and three people were killed they killed three people
there then the city now with a new mayor and what not then now people well are killing
but in any case it is but it is like like yes a city like that has to ha for the population
ah no there are lots of cars too many cars yes
well it is that
of course it is not bad it is for example i would prefer a thousand times to have a a system so so god because of the simple problem of
expensive and also that
fine and you
too much congestion
then of course it is like horrible traffic i mean it takes time like anywhere yes like
yes the car
ah yes like there
of course
ah
it's like that
of course of coures they are in o
ah ok ok
ok
that's good and where originally
mm
of course
ah how great it is the same like clearly eh and it gave a thing there like it is what is the university of washington
we were latino and
yes all ready
mhm
ah
oh clearly
clearly yes yes
clearly the wheat
really me too
no
clearly or what i like is that they believe that i am palestinian or an aquatic thing yes if i go into some restaurants
yes like food from the middle east they tell me
and they try to speak to me in arabic i don't know they think i look more like an indian or something hes but of course is there discrimination or not
oh but
ah of course
ah of course
and of course of course
yes yes of course
well here like super today that atlanta and the whole south is like sixtyfive percent black like that
yes
then it is like the fact that it is more divers like that it is like much more eh acceptable what do i now i but at the same time to the south it is the south of the
united states it has that history of being one of the most racist places of the whole united states in fact here
there was slavery and all that then in any case there is a certain minority of whites who hate any ethnic group and they have their weird demonstration and all those things but
right
yes but
right for example in the rurals parts of georgia you could see thing like you see in the ku klux klan i don't know
yes still
and that weird things but is is well well far what is the city meaning
is inside the city of atlanta the place to say more civilize then this thing no
yes by luck look what had happen then
hello
and how long have you lived here
oh okay
mnokay
okay
and then are you single now
oh okay
okay ah see and what is this called do you like it or not
oh
yes
ah
oh okay
oh okay
it's not like
coming here is a super drastic change for me
because as i was used to living in the city and here but anyways there's a city here where i could find what i need but life is
is calmer if i may put it that way
calmer and everything it's good though because for example there's not as much crime as in a bigger city
but it's kind of boring
kind of
here yes but not so much not so much even if it's small it's not so big
i am living here since two thousand two
no it was not so long ago it was a short time ago
yes from santiago
and and you where are you from
from santiago too
oh okay
look how how small the world is
and have you been in this thing long of calling by telephone
halo
oh yes
hello
oh okay
oh okay
ok are you calling everyday
oh okay
yes yes they also called me this week i coundlt pick up
week i've been kind of lazy
yes
yes
well i am viola from idaho
to talk for talking i think
yes i think so
eh
what happens is that they told me that they gave topics because like that you suppose you don't have to talk about personal things
because one shouldn't shouldn't like things that are very personal
because you never know the other person on the phone because
then that is why they give you subjects to have something to talk about
oh ok
yes the only thing they told me is that we had to talk subjects like subjects like without importance but
having like a subject not to just talk about stupid stuff
from atlanta
because yes that
that yes and you like it here
eh
eh
eh
it is a field and all of the fields are good
yes it's a medium area so i don't know about a night life so i know
eh
hello the two
oh and that
oh how are you
eh
oh
oh
yes well and like but there do people use cars a lot or is there public transportation
we ah well in any case because going out at two in the morning is not so
if you have a car or something like that
yes
oh ok
yes
here it is totally different
fine fine
well there are lots of cars people here have cars everybody because it is a necessity something like that
because there is no public transportation but
it is like no no it takes so long like to go everywhere the city were i live is like half the size of santiago but there are much fewer people because
because you know here things are like houses are bigger they are more separated things like that
and i am not in idaho falls
in idaho falls
en i go to a bigger city then
there in a bigger city but
where we are no it is country
ah
from chile
here there is not art like there are machines
there is mexican art and because it's more of a rural area
they hire mexican artists to do work in
the land and things like this
so almost always mexicans are seen the people confuse you for a mexican
besides latinos it is said that there are mexicans
so you have to walk saying no no no
i am not mexican
yes
eh
really
uh uh yes the same the same but not
i mean yes like in this area
the same it is more than anything with people who are latino but they don't know much to talk but
because in any case there are lots of people like that who go shopping and they don't know anything of
english well and then they have to go no but the same people you know like everywhere they are kind of
because there they are very discriminatory you know that
oh ok
oh
ah but things like heavy yes
the fight is strong
oh that's good
here no no is like something massive no like something like quite heavy but no no like groups things no like that
oh that is right
oh mm
eh
eh
oh oh thatbis weird
oh i married a gringo
yes i got married to a gringo i got here that way and you
oh really
mn
well oh hello juan marcela
yes
hmm
ah
so they didn't give you erm care
hmm
yes but it can be cheaper
yes that helps what a thing
yes well i think the whole system will have to fall before they do anything different because i think that very difficult to fix it because there is
the cost of the cost of everything depends on the demand and so if those costs go up and up and up
because there is more demand and people pay and then costs go up because people ask more more money and working people ask for more money it is a vicious circle an so how could it suddenly could they create social medication
yes how are you
it's impposible because all this people it's like
money doesn't stop to be like a drug they are used to a certain amount of money
and then at one moment they won't have it
yes of course it is
we should stop making bombs and going to war all that money could be used
in schools or in a medical system social security
mmm yes
well nurses are really well paid because there are not so many you know
mmm
yes like 30 dollars per hour
i think so you are in texas and i am in north carolina
mn
no but the difference is that they started well
yes like in argentina my parents have all the medical expenses paid
all the medical expenses paid they pay a little no but very little
yes
is is very expensive
in all the world in all the world
i was taking this medicine my son was taking for a short time and was not available here without the brand
eh and then last year we went to argentina went to the chemist and showed it and something which costed here more than fifty dollars
i bought there for twelve
yes nice to met you
twelve dollars same brand and all
and it could have been less if you bought another brand an unknown brand is another thing
but i don't understand
mm
mm
yes yes yes
i truly do i really do
that is that according to it if so
according to what expertise you have to operate here do you know what you should do
because don't they get you in contact with an organization that's called the shriners
yes
shriners yes
eh because they help children
now i don't know if they specialize on a specific illness or if the cover everything because maybe
you can communicate with them and tell them hey we have this boy and this is his condition and this is our situation
and maybe they can help in some way because the shriners help and pay for medical care of children who can not pay
parents can not pay
what do i know they say it is twelve minutes but their twelve minutes feel like a half hour
yes maybe i am wrong but not finding out you see it doesn't cost anything
and also if you call catholic charities
maybe they maybe they have more what do i know something that can help you in a
mhm i am cover trough my husband
mm
right
mmm of course he is growing up and maybe that medicine is not appropriate for him and they have to give him another
mmm
how bad
and you should be living in a state of anxiety
and this is a lot of stress
a lot of stress
mmm yes yes yes
hmm
and children are also covered so we are ok
of course because on top of that it embarrasses him let's see how old is he
how old is he
oh of course he is a teenager
yes do you also know where to find out in the hospitals where they teach
the doctors the medical centers where there are medical schools
over there many times the different departments
see people that not that can not pay in the situation like a normal see like us that can not go to a specialist doctor because it costs a lot of money
and we don't have it
and then they take and then they take note of what they give you and they charge you accordingly something as long as it is
reasonable something that you can well could uhm do sometimes they don't charge you anything
that is a problem right
what month and that that's interesting i had to get a test done i have add
and i was sure years ago i had it then i just got diagnosed i went to the hospital the one in the university of north carolina
and they did not charge me anything and they did all the tests
yes
oh so you are only with the
with the university oh
oh but what a thing
mm
they did not want to give you that information
so then maybe you can
mhm we are healthy but you never know
mm
maybe you can now
hello how are you my name is juan marcela
community people
and so the papers they asked for with the my home and proof of work and they finally found a pretext to to not not give it to me because they asked me
to give information about the person who was hiring me and at that time well the person refused to give information right
and and in my case i have a son who has epilepsy
and then he needed some some emergency care here things that
uh no no no they didn't want to describe me true then in the cases with him he got ill once yes he got worse
and so i had to to go back to mexico and for him to be seen by his doctor over there
and he got a prescription and i run out of the medication erm i usually buy it in mexico and
it is a problem with the prescription and then a friend who's a doctor had the samples and he gave me medication samples
isn't it yes he gave it to me so yes it is something we think that well there should be some kind of bit more flexible right so that by itself there is for the community but it is a specific type of community
listen do not we talked the other day with
yes yes
right
yes it should be
yes
exactly that's a problem it's a circle that works with profit it's stronger right
then the interest rates are worse
mmm
mmm well only with a little cut
because well i don't know how it works where you live but here people with money are nurses and doctors right
then well here you can see a 30 year old woman with a really nice car
yes i am so glad
and she is a nurse when you find out that she is a nurse well
yes that's similar of what they get paid i understand that in canada they have many medical
then any resident in canada has the right to medical services just for been there and it really doesn't have greater consecuences upon the economy
and is right
uh uh
yes yes yes that is the other thing that one could do to try to pay something
is going to have some kind of insurance but even that is
is expensive right and i don't know how the prescription drugs are here in mexico are cheaper and also
there is more competition about prescription drugs there
uh uh
i have not forget you we talked nicely right
yes yes yes
yes
the same yes
and in mexico's case for example the medication of my son comes in 5 or 6 brands
with similar ingredients
no yes yes and here you don't have more than one and second that literature is not the best and if you hear only about laboratories i thought that all the north american laboratories for
then at the hour of the competency cause here there is a monopoly
strong interest in everything no
mm
but
do you have medical insurance here are you cover
yes
uh uh yes
yes i already know yes i already know
mm
mm
yes
uh uh uh uh well yes look yes
yes i knew that listen did the time run out already or what
ah see that i knew him and i thought it was for me and i was smaller without being tired and like that only
mm i am going to crash
uh uhm
uh uh uh that is it
yes yes it is simple because really well on the one hand the maintenance is a medication that this person who helped me with the sample says no man that
here they treat us well no problem as soon as you see a community center or such and
there are a lot of options but knowing a little more about progress of medicine we believe a deeper diagnostic could improve the life of our son with
with epilepsy
because it was under control but the last two years it have come apart it has been out of control
and well yes they gave him another kind it made him feel worse and them he had to quit and return to the basic
yes he worsened
yes you know you have to keep trying
yes sometimes it's like this
oh yes we are we are not
always
you have to look up all the time
when you know it you are always expecting it don't finally happen but this is a traumatic for my soon he is an adolescent
it happens to him in school and then he feels very bad
yes yes it is a stigma it is a stigma what he has no then
seventeen
well yes so to go back to the topic i think that he would owe a few good ones here
system of uhm
ehm ehm
yes
we are not covered that is a problem because something can happen at any time
hmm
hmm yes
mm
uh uh
uh uh
oh really
so then is all great to which orientation we go now well in fact where i went in fact is called university system a healthcare system something like that but
so then that's exactly where i got bounced
i said
mm uh uh so then if they told me no well you have to bring us information i had a letter showing my income and so on right
i know the other day i went to an office they supposedly give you something like a pension for
but not that we need the social security of your employer so then that's when they did not want to
no well not me but well then now i have my social security myself
yes employed
well the same me
uh uh
hy how are you my name is juan
than the sometimes we say that belongs to the institution where you are no more like a job tool
but a more personal tool looks like is a car no
yes yes exactly besides i am here in texas
i feel that the car culture here is like a culture reminicent of the horses also
no is like a horse is something like very very very personal a close thing
in our lives they take care of them here is as important as the come on as the horses at that time
for some years ago and well so if they not say so in our time of comunication most important devices are those that have to do with communication computer
eh as permitted the information management and all that thing no
but
yes
i'm in san antonio mateo i think we already talked you're in philadelphia
exactly and here the working people have like as in those days a mule no they need one a pick up truck pick
pick up truck no
and the computers well since practically there is there is television telephone and computers in all homes no but but like there are other dimensions no about the technological question then the car seems to be
of the most important
oh what what technical question technological is more important in your life that is what we are discussing right now if it would have to be the car or if it would have to be the computer what do you think
aha exactly
aha
aha
yes yes
you have your cell phone
ah look nice talking to you again
yes look that yes that is very important what you have just said a long time ago when i worked i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important no
and well the messages were on the computer i was always on the internet the emails more than the phone neither cell phone nor anything no
the computer was the most important
but now with the kind of work that i'm doing the car is the most important the computer because the car is what lets you re th the kind of work that i'm doing is more
more physical right then the car becomes the ins the more important device and the computer well is a second level even though it's also very important right
but well it is good for the kind of work
yes yes
yeah yes it is
oh yeah
yeah uh yeah no well here because the distances that you have to cover for work the car is fundamental
listen here is all good what do you think about today's topic
but yeah in in the city i think that yeah the most impor and depending on the work too well uh it could be the computer right then
the the other question or or the communication devices right like you said the cell phone and
and that uh and the other question is if you consider that those technologies turn into more of a problem than than in
alright what kind of problems he could have like you just said the only problems with the car could come from parking
no here in texas we dont't especially where i am have that problem with the parking lots of open spaces didn't come up
we say those problems over here but anyway don't know what do you think more than anything i would say related to cars there isn't any overall big issue with them at least
we could consider an issue the interest created around car industry and how they usually seem to affect the development of the technology of
transportation no for example
yes
yes yes but yes
the topic is about technical equipment like the technology the one you most use and depend on and yes how do you consider that dependency
for
yes
exactly yes like they say too with the auto industry right if they advanced technologically like the electronic one the best car would transport us with
100 km with only 1 liter of gasoline
right and instead of costing you say 20000 dollars would cost you 2000
if that were the case no but as technology in this case the industry has its interests then no like it doesn't move forward no you see what they're saying now with the hybrids
that no a lot of them say that they're not affordable that in reality it's only a matter of image that companies manage and when it's time to see the tables of of performance
of the hybrid cars well i thought they would be much more efficient i think that what they have accomplished on efficiency is minimal
no no it doesn't seem to me that they have a real a real this that it's really a very important change like technological given the efficiency that
what
and how do you consider the issues of the technology no you daily life if it turn more of a problem than a solution something like that
no i don't think that it is so important every time that the efficiency they demonstrate isn't radically different to the one the other cars have is very little no you see i say
one to according to the tables an economical car drives you it can be thirtysix miles per gallon
and a hybrid can drive you fifty
uh well
uh huh
yes exactly and and of course and but at the same time for example with these autos of um there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance as the hybrids and they're not hybrids no
by small cars new ones that aren't in the north american market that are in the european or latin american market where they have to be much more efficient
and smaller no so if we compare the costs of a hybrid against a small european car or or from iso which circulate in latinamerica well then
n it turns out to be much more expensive to have a car at what is the initial cost and for what is going to be saved in gasoline ends
being less to what an auto has a good economic car no
it's the same as as i was thinking exactly that they should include it no
european
yes it's yes
yes i as a matter of fact years ago that was the problem with oil in the eighties or something like that i don't remember
i thought that there was going to be a change in the culture because they started to to develop smaller cars here in the united states
i though well there will be a change in the culture but that was only for the moment no it seems because it has some enormous cars they continue like
exactly how's then but i told then that yes the car look as the most important no and i think after that at best a computer too but no
aha exactly but sometimes eh it looks more like a personal element depending on the case could be the cars no because the computer already is a tool more
hey very good eh mateo here
why you have to take care of the car you know
ah
you used more horses
yes
yes
yes because in texas there yes but only there
you need the car you know to work
so
ah yes yes
uh
yes yes and you are
yes but the questions about the topic where which ones
well for me it would be more my computer and my cell phone
because you know because i have my cell phone and i am always with it
and well i have gotten used to having a cell phone you know
in before i did not have a cell phone until i was about twenty years old but now that to that live in philadelphia in the city and that i am not always at the house fo
i'm not always returning to the house for you know see my messages
well i am always always i always have my cell phone
i think that it is very is like surprising that almost everybody has a cell phone here in the united states
yes
yes
yes what you where what
but now
good for i think how good you and you were in texas and obviously you know there there's more uh how do you say it i understand you have more like farms and everything there you know
much more space
that in the in the city having a car can be an inconvenience too
because you always have to try to park and you have to pay a lot to park and the gas station isn't close and i don't know it's
it's more of a problem than a tor than than a help but obviously you know
it's better to have a car a i think
aha of course
aha
aha
no i didn't listen what is the topic
aha but don't you think is a bit magnificent the change happened in like sixty years
ah and if we look 75 years in the past there wasn't even a bus but today almost all people have it
and the same thing with pc's they have machines that would not see the market at least for 10 years because
the are very advanced and they will
charge their costs do you get me i don't think i explain very good
aha
yes
yes
yes that was an important change
you don't think it is an important change or
that includes the automobiles the cars
ah
uh huh
ah no ah yes sure sure that there are cars there now like the the ford
the pickup well not the pick up trucks because they're changing them so that they're more efficient you know
but but the expedition and those enormous cars and that they spend you know can only go like twenty miles eighteen miles per gallon something like that that is an enormous expense
ah yes
and why is it that
why is it that the united states is one of the only nations that has this that you have these enormous autos only here you know
over there in other countries they all have small cars that well different different culture you know but
ah uh huh
yes because is you know a machine
yes but
yes the most evident is the computer then but not the only one
ah
yes and that's why the same thing applies when you buy a car and you always use it and you have to maintain it you always do is part of your life
oh faviola hi
then uhm i find that i was right in the classification they have i think it's the responsibility of the adults until when the kids can see television
they're doing their job those on the movies and
it's their business you
yeah now if you want it take it if you want to see it or not is not their responsibility anymore they se
that sells
and that's what they do it's not their fault the buyer is at fault
yes
yes
yes
exactly
how are you
mmm i also believed that i am totally agree and that normally have access to children when parents are televicion outside accurate
children are alone
and there is not enseñarlle or the pope to tell you this should not see this if you see
not clear because you have no idea
exactly
shure
not and also
if not moreover that when children reach an age my son was fifteen sixteen seventeen years and i said do not worry because you did the best i could do
ah you descend from twentyfive genes and the rest is education and decision my decision in my life
sure i learned then oh wait no eh oh i was
very good with some sun or with some coldness
my cellphone was ringing okay okay let me answer
eh don't hang up because we have to speak for twelve minutes
i'm just going to go turn it off
so about the people i think the movies that i love to watch are the horror movies
but sometimes the ones that are scary to me i'm an adult
they are scary but i'm going to find out the horror movies
yes
yes that's why that's why i respect the fact that my son said ones that it's a fifty percent responsibility
of each person the person and then you did the best you could but then kids grow up and before they are eighteen years old the
some are more mature than the norm
cold
and begin to see the r movies
at fourteen or fifteen and the pg thirteen are been seen by eleven or twelve years old kids
and sometimes even the littlest ones sometimes the littlest ones because i remember of a friend of jenny that watched them she sees harry potter and is
pg thriteen pg fourteen and then i say jenny doesn´t like it she gets scared
she gets scared by the monsters and all that stuff
but i agree that most of it is the criteria that you give to them and at the end take care of them if you don´t want them to watch television when they are alone
don´t let them alone with the tv
but it is just television
you should have a formed criteria to go and see a movie
uh huh in the same school it shows movies to them
yes
they show him documentaries
to follow like like superman the little child to go out the window and is killed
that they want to fly no you i want to ask you a question
eh you read the rules that there are in this telephone game
um i was asking myself ah how is this are you preparing for christmas now
the coming birthday no
that's what i was going to tell you
cook and sew sew that which you did that which you gave to me
no that of the table
oh because you are
no i haven't gotten this topic and i had to talk about eh specifically the person when i got talked to me about violence
that's pretty
andreita's birthday is coming up too oh three
oh yes but i remember that it was like three days
what did you buy miranda
ay how cute
ay how nice
how exciting
and do you know who else has a birthday
the same date
that i remember when i was there
that they did not like the idea of going to see a movie i told them a world that is a world has violence
your fatherinlaw yes
he he juan luis sandra's youngest son
also the twenty the twentyninth also i remember that about the same date i remember that they were all on the same date
no you went to carlistos' birthday and the girl's
no you went once you went to chile and left the gift which was for the birthday
ok that was another birthday she has three
yes for a nephew of hers that came after
no but sandra will not have birthday she will not have a party this year
no i mean just for the family only because they will buy something better for the baby and
the fact is that she does parties that are too big then
they have always had and i have the experience to teach the kids with pure peace and love in the television or or of the world and then when they confront the world realize that it's the school
too much she spends too much in that and she can't buy the baby the things that
they of course have to decide between one thing of the other so this year decided the baby decided that only the family
of course to have a preset more
the youngest of all
and and says i do not want clothes
i do not want book i just want toys
they find that the kids hit him that they didn't know how to defend above all things when you have kids of your own
i am ana maria
i am in agreement that the responsthe maximum responsibility is of the parents
they're gaining their cash what's their job
doing their business yeah
of yeah
yeah
yes because in the end he likes the product that's why
with you it's final responsibility whether it's violence sex whatever there is to protect a a child the final responsibility it's for the parents even with a qualification system in place
because if there's for example a movie qualified as pg 13
and you have a minor of that age and you let him see the movie it's your responsibility
it's because you let him and you thought it could be isn't it
hi faviola
entonces why me the the the association or or or whatever that puts the uh that puts the qualifications already has it then
i think yeah look we think more or less the same on that faviola because in the end the responsibility of nurtering and taking care and what you want him to see and what not
your children or your family and your mother or your husband as a mother
exact
mmm
or go to a sleepover you do not know either
if you go to a sleepover and they put a movie watch a movie or no control in that house or whatever
not know
i think the important thing is to give children one respect these indicates whether a given good principles at home one as a family or teaches things
actually i do not like or do not like it you see it or not prepared or just going to get far
good and you how is the weather over there in your house
that because as they say you can not have in a glass box
leaves exposed or exposed
mmm
look with that
mm
okay
yes
okay ah
i see
you get scared you get scared
some sun and some coldness ah
i see but you are responsible for watching them you scare yourself
i see well i don't like them so i don't watch them i don't watch any of them that's my decision i could since i have the age to watch them but if it's too violent i don't watch them
yes
yes
mmh
yeah yes
yes thirteen yes
yeah
yes
yes because because
over here it's ugly we are too cold what do you think of the movies have you already talked about this topic
but think that you can not control them
that´s what i say you can control them you can not see this movie because of this or that because you lack of maturity or whatever we want to tell them isn´t that true
yes that is why i say it doesn´t have a purpose to say you can not see that not because there will be a time when they go to a friend´s house
oh the same school but the same school is a little more supervised because that is another thing because it goes it goes with a purpose
but what i fear more is when he goes to friends' house and they have sometimes the television right there in the room that they use it so much or the computer or whatever
and they have access to information without the parents no nor the parents have any idea and they are in the room the parents think that they are listening to music or whatever
at best they are looking at something inappropriate then that's why i say or that is that which happens it's that if my daughter or my son or whatever
faces that situation he has to learn to value and to learn to respond to that that is what i say or rather trying trying to give them the values of the house
me of course because you know that they are still not prepared
uh huh
me too i have gotten this topic before
yes okay
yes yes yes now i am preparing now i am buying the gifts for the family but now i am with all with other things in mind
yes but i am preparing buying presents for the family at least my nephews i have those ready now we have bought the presents then the big people remain no more
buy the big people something an intention anyway the majority of the presents i'm going to make them
i'm going to cook yes ah
yes and also for some children yes also
yes yes also but i don't have time yet i have to wait til the middle til the last week of december to do it
because i have no time before then
yes so that's what i'm going to do also that's why i'm going to make some gifts but for example andreita who's birthday is soon
two days before miranda
mhm
yes is the twenty fifth or twenty four i don't remember
three days then from the twenty four so i have her gift i bought her the same thing i bought miranda so eh
for the one of those screens that you draw and then you erase
because she likes it she's seen it and she likes she makes lines and then she erases them the i'm not going to give it to them yet because they are too small and they put them in the mouth
but in the meantime the pencil and screen yes
but yes because little things like that
of course you see then these things like these it is a pleasure to do them then i bought the same for andreita and with that already
ok who
who
my fatherinlaw that
mhm
yes it is true who
oh yes ok
i don't remember about him having one on i didn't know at least
i have not gone to any birthday at sandra's house i went to just one i don't remember really
eh it was in april well when i went to chile it was in april
and i left there the yes i left the present there
of course he came yes yes she told me that she had given it to her yes but what you call it no
no no okay
yes it's true
she spends too much yes
aja
what they really want exactly
and to have a more special present
juan juan is the oldest or the youngest
oh yes yeah
poor him
tamara
then what do you think about what they show in the movies the
ok
ok
yeah
no i am not at my computer i am sorry
ok
yes because there are plenty of movies like that i have noticed
yes i like hum here where i live there were some of these oh like hollywood video or blockbuster but it was like
smaller
it was then they had movies like those they are talking about ah documentaries and like that but they closed it because like the stores these big ones are always here people don't want to go to that
yes and you
but those are the best as you find movies i like yes my husband is an american but he also likes international movies movies that have more
more important things to say
once in a while as i have small children sometimes they want to watch some movies and we take them but usually we don't we have before we went like two or three times a month to the movies
but now it has shortened so it is once or twice every two months
aha exactly
i am from panama
oh ok
in then it is true is true
yes it is true what you say i here my husband and i we watch the news
because every time you watch something or they show something so stupid
i'm in the state of washington in seattle
or you have or they exaggerate too much
because when i was we were in panama before noriega left panama
and were we there and my husband you know that white guy white paper compare with my dad is black and my mom is white then i am more black than my dad so
when we went out you knew that he was an american
we both got into we got into where we had to go he had to go to the work to the base and i had to go with him or something like
and we would get home and turn on the television and we would watch some news about panama i would watch the
hey weren't we there this morning i don't remember seeing anything about it there
and the next day same happened and i said  oh exagent i believe they were showing stuff that happened last week and overreacting
since then he doesn't want to believe the things that are shown in the television
the news nothing that's what i always tell my children don't believe everything that is said on television
ah yes
because it's not true and that
aha
they spoke of a man whose head was cut off
i don't remember
aha
oh from  churillo
yes that's where it was the part of the police force was there
that's right
no no cause like i was saying i don't really pay attention to the news
tv
yes
yes theater
aha
tv or tv for all
with
okay
okay
aha
yes
pardon
no maybe but i do not recall
yes this is i think my 23th call
hmm
some
aha
yes and this is the second time i do this service for them
yes
yes i
carolina
no you got that same mail right i mean apparently this will keep going that's what i got from the mail they sent
more like yeah tell me
tell me well i am going to tell you honestly it has been more than a year since we stopped watching movies movies in regular movie theaters and we started at the theater
little conventional
we started at the theater for example in the case of theater no the same one as in tv now we watch documentary type movies hum with different kind of messages then
watch movies that are in hum how is this called the movie festivals here as an example recently ended the international latin american movie festival
hum if he was
hello
oh ok approximately a month or less than a month because as i tell you it has a been a long time since we decided that we were not going to keep wasting our time
time in the majority of cases they are really movies with a quite silly and absurd content and well we took the decision that no we did not want to waste more time and money
tamara how are you
eh watching one type of movies that really did not take anywhere
yes
ok
of course
exactly exactly
aha
ok the same we we usted to go about once a month but we used to go frequently lots lots and one good day we saw a movie but so s
tupid so dumb that i was bothered to be in the movie theatre i well and what are we doing here what waste of time is this
no no no and really suddenly we started to receive information about other kinds of movies and well we switched completely to that furthermore right now we are in one
in one of those kicks that we are even kind of intellectual now but it is that it is because actually it kind of got to that point where you feel that
fine fine where are you
what are you doing no i mean to see that honestly i rather go to sleep or i'd rather do something else instead of of i don't tell you all movies there are some that have a
a very different content that it is worth watching them but in the end i have felt that they are making movies like just for making them
aha like well we have to make ten movies we are going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter how or when however it comes out without
care ase we say where are you from
ah ok i am from venezuela
right yes
we say in that way to the  macha no like well yes do movies like you want but yes released some good released and others if they don't be released don't be released but
honestly not and the same is happening with the tv right now we had cable and now just a matter of a month ago we canceled it because not no i don't know suddenly as
we was against that we realized that was too much media manipulation they only show the news that are good for them they hide the truth
oh then that is talking about the news and about the movies then yes sure a movie really very good very good
wow i'm in los angeles
but then they show it again and show it again and show it again oh my god what is this we are paying for this then it is like a discomfort right now we have a discomfort with
with the media we are in that way reluctant yes yes
i think right
exactly
exactly
oh imagine
logic logic
sure
exactly
exact
yes it's amazing just
exactly
exactly
you see coincidentally they showed a picture called the it was something like  defending panama
that was exactly the problem with noriega and so we watched the documentary and i was shocked because i had never imagined that what happened there was so sad and so
ugly everything that happened
and oh yeah
i can't remember but i think that happened the night of the bombings and lots of people died there even these past few days they showed a
a summary of the president's visit
he was around there and people were protesting asking why the current president did nothing so the victims of that sector would be remembered
i think it was called  los de richos the chinese sector that practically the whole town disappeared and i
right now i was making a call and suddenly i i mean i didn't think that today sunday i was half more asleep than awake and i oh my god
ah del chorrillo exactly
yes but just like you say it seems that happens the same way in venezuela with the current president there are things happening that you know aren't actually happening
that already happened long time a go so they put them here in venezuela as if they were happening and what not its crazy the other day i wrote to one reporter
from univision telling them not to be so shameless asking them to not report things that aren't true people first say hey that president
and what not that's a crazy one what they are doing is distorting the information in a way that they make him seem as a monster a
dictator and we have gone through four elections and four referendums so it can not get any more democratic than that but it's his personality
he's got a personality that is uncommon and people don't know how to accept that so even him is the first on criticize everhing
and well i don't know if you've heard him
of course look there's an internet page were you can watch tv from all countries including of course panama its called
te ve cuatro like tv four all
yes yes they got me off base but you've already been doing this for some time
four all
four is a number four
tv number four all
exactly exactly there you go
is dot com yes
there you can see the schedule of all the channels all the channels in the world of course you also have panama and venezuela and there now i watch venezuelan tv
but i specifically watch the government chanel the national chanel because the other channels belong to the opposition then of course it is a litle bit more of the same
but i like to watch and to see the stupid things that they are saying
then i compare it and since i have this internet page now i don't have to turn on the tv now we are there but stuck to the internet watching the ___ channels
of the whole world a little like to compare you see that is what is going on and even what we are doing as well with the radion we are listening to community radio that you feel that it i you
wow you're almost ready i'm right in the middle this is my 10th
you are really saying the truth or at least the other face of the coin let's not say that it is the truth one hundred per cent because sometimes it is not
that is it is not that i don't know but that one can not say either that all of the ones that say the other it is not but
darn they really do manipulate things too much
i don't know if you
you got one i don't know if you saw here a movie that was called auto fox
that is a documentary that they worked at fox new
and well practically they would force them to say what was not true and then they decided to resign to the channel and aside from resigning all of them got together and started to do like a protest to a level
well on the level of of ehm locally to tell the world what was going on over there inside fox news it is very interesting it was called something like
fox workers that are outside
something like that like out on the outside
oh okay okay yes because casually i got a mail that they will accept people who'll do again the eh participate because at first you could participate only once
and fox of fox news
hello my name is fernanda
what what classification
but i think that most television shows let's say if you watch during the day time is when many times children are at home
those are things that are not appropriate for most of them
and i think hat eh americans have no like that the mo moral standards have gone down you get me so
now many things are like normal that that i think shouldn't be
aha
mhm
sure
okay
sure and
how are you
mhm
ah
what's that
and that could happen to any child watching television
and you can't be with your kid all the time you can't jump and try to see what he's watching you have to trust that at least during the day
the shows are not going to include nudity or bad words
yes
in the district of mexico mhm
i p yes i pi look i am colombian and i think that in colombia neith
television is much better than here in that sense
from washington
because they c can show let's say at ten in the evening and the programs they show are never so you don't don't run the risk no that they would be so bad like here here
what's more here when it's not e even ten or at any other time you run the risk of seeing anything
ah yes
what horror
yes
yes imagine when lets say there are babysitters and things like that that have no center and you are not even home to see
you do not know what they seethat they go to their friends for whatever
i think
yes
mhm
washington dc
right
not me
exactly
they don't care mhm
sometimes and
yeah yeah yeah
sure sure
yes one does not know how they will change
exactly
and one gets accustomed do you understand so to speak
yes washington state
like i sometimes see and one does not realize how things have changed
and where are you
yes yes yes of course yes
yes the true is that i don´t know to much about movies because
let's say i don't have children or anything like that so i almost never realize
my name is
has many dirty words and porn sometimes another one pg thirteen is more quiet
and doesn´t have such many things like nudity and dirty words the true is that to me those classifications sometimes are like they don´t
know the people who criticize those movies don´t know how to grade them or i don´t know your point of view
aha
aha
aha
aha
yes
yes
yes yes it's true because eh and it's true because eh once well i don't have cable i have the regular channels the ones you watch
hello fernanda how are you my name is claudia
but for example i once had for for a while cable and sometimes it was well why do they like it ten in the morning eleven and well y don't like to keep changing channels
to keep on choosing my program that i'm going to watch in that ra at that time
and sometimes the show movies that really uf a ten year old or a nine year old kid was at home and he was watching that he was changing channels at the same time as i was and
he stopped on that channel there things that were very very much for adults
so i said uf i said i thought about the kids i said well i'm i'm married i've been married for three years i've got a kid who is almost two years old
my son is going to grow up and this is just going to get worse so
imagine what kind of cartoons are they going to watch them i remember that i was once watching the television you see in mexico i'm from mexico city
it was around ten in the evening ten pm so i turned on the tv i had cable there the cable tv
the channel her it's number sixteen so i was watching a cartoon in english because they show some in english during the evenings some are in spanish too
so a cartoon in english was being aired so i started watching and my mom was there with me she was all calm because i was watching a cartoon
where are you talking well where are you talking from
so the cartoons started to get naked
and the guy was doing stuff to two other cartoons it was a cartoon imagine that ten o'clock in the evening and my mom said
she turned the television off and she had to explain it to me because she was surprised i mean shocked because i was watching a regular cartoon channel
so i mean i don't not even cartoons are safe now
cartoons are like that sometimes
yes
yes yes it's true but really it's not cartoons sorry japanese cartoons are the ones that have the most classification eh in mexico eh
eh tr in cablevision and multivision that would be the same as cable here so ah over there in mexico they don't have as many restrictions for example in regular television with regular channels
they have like more more restrictions eh not so much in the other cables and for example in in teles for example a regular ch channel for kids
in television like that any channel the channel for example channel five that it's for cartoons
ah which one of them two
for example after ten at night eleven and you can watch tv and they don't show such ugly programs well
before in mexico but for example if you are watching a cable channel you run the risk that the cartoon may be something that sometimes is some
pornographic thing or more nudity
so mm aha
aha
aja
yes yes it's true lo the other well eh i was with a neighbor imagine i was with a neighbor it was twelve twelve thirty in the afternoon
so her boy was watching eh the a cartoon channel and then the girl thought about changing the channel and em and it was another channel that was programmed for them for children
well there was a show there was where there was a a girl that had adventures of a girl that was that that in a hospital
and suddenly it happened right there in the hospital and they were showing how how her mom was giving birth to her little brother
ah yes because then i think there are two or not
yeah but you can tell i took and told him at her mother and she said ah no there is no problem is a channel of
of of cartoons of of that they play programs and sincerely i was i was they did not leave much to the imagination it was really a pose of well it was an operating room where the lady was having a baby
they were they were six years
because they are twins have eh the two had six years and their mon was letting them watch that well each each parent can let them see
what they want but sinceraly a mdo not want to explain to my kids too much for the moment sincerly i watch more what they see
well you see no in that aspect but uf
mm aja
yes no
yes is of those really those rating they pass ynynny primary for the televison the truth already already n
they do not leave a thing to imagination they show you
ah i see and the other one
now at whatever whatever time of the day you see one of those telenovelas i do not like to watch telenovelas but see
many momon is home and has young children three four years five or more they are at home and they see they are watching their telenovela
and always estthey show scenes were they are the a couple they are there having relations
during the day why do they put on sooperas from six am until it gets dark
and they're like that so then we stop having an imagination
then the programs are classified so it would be normal to see a pornographic on tv in the middle of day
and the parents would think its something normal
and i think that if the parents talked to that tv station and told them to put away unacceptable programs or to put privacy on some scenes from those kind of scenes
i think it will go down a little but i don't know anymore its now normal when parents and kids watch something like that together
what are they teaching them i don't like those classification things and the producers dont really care i think its only convenient to them because
yes i´m here in idaho state i don´t know if you know it
if a movie has a sexual scene or bad words people buy it or people watch it and even laugh about it
or sometimes it even gets their attention because there's a strong scene so those things actually help the
producers to sell
so no to be honest the only kid of movies i actually like are the disney ones
i like kids movies
even though i'm already tired of them but still like them i have a disney movie here but i honestly just don't like movies
hardcore movies that that have a lot of sex and all that because i repeat it to you i am going to have children so i would not be
and at least if they are going to play a movie well that at least it is a decent movie that does not have so many things
as the things are going even the disney ones may have pornography in a while right then
no no so then already the truth is that this is truly reaching too far already you turn the tv on and see a tv spot
yes but that thing about the movies the fact is than in my point of view i don´t agree with them because after all
about women pads and it appears well until almost they are going to explain how soon they will display a naked movie and are going to
show there how she is placing the pad on
because sometimes they even draw it for you i do not know if you have seen such commercials that uf they do not scare you because you are already grown up right but
if a little boy or girl is watching them and you say it the mom is there and can answer all is right and if it is the friend who is there
and she or he answers he/she can explain him/her the wrong info so
then yes
they don´t classify them very well ah for example sometimes they say is pg and later you see that movie and it really
good night my name is mariza de philadelphia
otherwise christianity is the most powerful religion in the world and they are the ones who most who have more control to have an influence to politics to countries
mhm
mhm yes
yes
mhm
really
ah ah no
so that's what i had heard yes
exactly yes there are many problems yes
no each one can believe whatever they want what happens is that they try to im impose their belief for everyone and that the bible be that they are the ones that think
mariza mariza
yes fundamentalism yes yes yes from the right but it's also the country is eh the power is in the hands of the party that all from the president to all the ones that are into in is in the white house are all right wing conservatives
whites from eh christians and those are the ones that people with power in this country the ones that own companies everyone is the same that they are many conservative fundamentalist people from the right that want to take out the law
the right to abort the right to for example like another question was about homosexuality gay marriage the right to believe in the
yes more scientific no no one should not only believe in what they say they say god created man and woman but also give the option for kids to believe
that it was charles darwin the theory of evolution and
and is very complicated also the other questions was about homosexuality yes yes if we were all the same or believed the same thing these problems wouldn't exist asked
but
yes
of course i i don't have any
mm
oh yes maybe so
yes i am convinced that is that because i know many people that are
eh well homosexuals or lesbians and i'm very informed and then that's why always i don't know why since i was since i was a girl well
like i used to accept people because i didn't think they were better or worse for being homosexuals and every one has a right to i don't know to get married to
to be with whoever they want its' the same whether is a man or a woman i don't care and i think they have the same rights because they are citizens just the same and they pay their own taxes
they deserve the right to marry to live with whomever
mhm
of course but the the church disagrees
it thinks that is an abomination because the marriage is defined as the union between a man and a woman and believe and the and people and the devout fundamentalist christians like i used to say before see that like an abomination and they are so stubborn they don't understand that
maybe that was before the traditional way of thinking in the past but now times are changing and each one so is the same as before homosexuality has always existed since the human being beginning what happen is that before was a way and right now so
it goes i don't know things are more liberal nowadays let's say people people are not afraid of say anymore so i am homosexual or i am gay or i am whatever
in san antonio yes
that's the problem that have the church has a problem but it can't do anything becaus
people are accepting the fact that people yes look he is homosexual yes and is okay very good
of course
yes
yes the re the religion would have to be something personal not something mixed with politics everyone can what what you think what you believe belongs to anyone it has not to because is
oh look because you don't think the same that i think you're not like i am so about how are blamed because they are not equal and it not that everyone can think whatever wants believe in anyone or anything wants does not have
for christians because they talk badly about muslims because they say they are radicals or talk poorly about about atheists because they don't believe in god and call them heretics or
but i don't know
that is not very christian to be like that you have to accept people as they are and each one who believes or has his or her religion but that is the problem with fundamentalists they don't accept differences
mm
yes a very complicated subject and very controversial
what happens is that yes it is that in this country when children are those families the christian families that rightwing let's say that they raise their children in such a way that since they are very young they teach them they have to be like that and like that and like that then
when they are older and they meet people who are different then they tell them no that is not that because they taught me it is like this and like this and like this and it has to be
you know that they are very radical no they don't accept differences because they were rased in a way that their parents taught them hten
i for example had the good fortune of traveling a lot of meeting people from many races many cultures then i am open to everything
and that is why when i see a person who is not i immediately know it just looking at them i say this person is not going to accept because i am not like her i am not i don't think the same i don't see myself the same
but it is that there are kinds there are people of all kinds and and well there must be radical christians there must be all kinds but i believe that yes it does influence the country a lot the religion yes
yes
yes i they are
sure yes yes yes
the message is pretty clear it's been five years with this government and when bill clinton was in the government well he was not that he was pretty open let's say sure he was leftist more open a more open person
mhm
he would understand people's problems and this government lets say they are religious christians from the right i mean the ones that
are taking the decisions of how things are done in this country that's why there's so many controversy regarding marriages it's also like that in the supreme court with the judges they want them to be rightwing they want them to be religious they
don't care whether they are catholics they just want that they they want to eliminate the right to abortion and things like that it's ridiculous at this stage in the century
they want they want us to go back to go back instead of moving forward they want things that were done thirty or forty years ago that can't happen
but that's how we are now
my family is from spain so we are catholics let's say when you are born you get baptized then there's the first communion and all that well i got married in the church too
i believe well i have my beliefs but i not attend to the church to every sunday service neither practice i am i believe
but let's say i do it at my own way let's say that the faith i have with me i don't
neither neither i am i mean i am very open i mean it's contradictory i'm quite believer i'm catholic but i'm not you know i'm not funda nothing
yes yes yes there is lot of economic interest yes
yes
that's the problem it's at first sight that they are not interested in the church members they are interested in the money and
and also neither they seem to be quite believers there had been a lot of cases of child abuses and things like that of child abuses
that are often heard so one ask himself how this can be possible that a a priest do this to a child and there is much controversy regarding this
but let's say that faith is one himself i don't know what each one is free to believe whatever wants and practice it but respecting those who are not equal
because there are a lot of religions and what's happen is that christian religion is the most plenty in all the world it's the most the one who has power over everything
yes but they don't have too much economic power that's the problem
ahh yes in reality every nowadays in this country eh in the united states there is also a lot a lot of problems with religion that is mixed of with politics and a lot of rightwing people that are the ones that want to have control
they try to control the country based on their religion also and it could be a positive or a negative for a lot of people well the help like praying or believing in something it helps them etc
hello hello my name is juan are you marisol
so they exercised a power very well very direct very clear trying to influence people there in the church
in the sermon above all it very much called my attention against the public school
directly against the public school and they prayed so that god would deliver us from the public school one day
because yes
and against the theory of that they try to see the theory of evolution no
no terrible they said why this harassment of teachers that teach the bible to explain the creation of the world
may the train take me i say well that with all reason no the bible doesn't make an explanation of the world
exactly those are fundamentalism no
yes
well i think that maybe the more alike we are the more problems no
perphaphs that is mariza we talked like in a few days i think
in that sense the differences help to compliment
the topic the topic of homosexuality is very controversial
but at any given moment is like like the tolerance the phenomenon of homosexuality should be something that that we should be well informed on me personally for example i used to think before that
it could be regarded as a deviation homosexuality but lately i've read that it's also a question of genetics
no
well yes
yes
yes yes i agree with you exactly i think that they have all the rights so we can have any other kind of people and in this case with the rights concerning the marriage
because many people think about the homosexuality like a very perverted thing and they don't have the right to get married not when is a situations when actually the marriage is an agreement
between two persons that decide to do something in common
could be i am in san antonio texas
no
yes
of course yes there is some that is very extreme about eh the family and the marriage the church institute and the god blessing to the marriage and stuff when actually
the church and religion is a form of institution it is the same as the school has
first the need of change and find new new ways to learn the things of the life
of the society and the individuals no
aha
yes well but in that case to accept differences seems to be something that has to do with a matter of humanity no
like it is a paradox not to be able to accept the difference they think but aha
yes
ok well the subject today is the issue with religion right
aha
eh yes it influences a lot what surprises me the most in this case
in this country that it is so fundamental no
with the churches there is a good percentage of fundamentalists even in the discurse of the very president there is fundamentalism
not there
aha
aha do you do you follow any particular religion
sure
yes
yes it happens the same to me and when i have some closeness with the catholic church it is almost temporal because they are so hey where is a sense of integration of community in here
well exactly like the need of religion is something something we all have i suppose
created interest in everyone seems
no then
yes
yes
yeah
therefore in the world that we living in at this side of the world no because i believe not anymore not even the christians are mayority i believe there are more muslims than christians
mhm
and that like every other need the institutions are based of
give an answer and end up being like a form of control right
yes look that in this case for example here where i live i once went to church
what they represented a whole project ideology but plain and simple they are the most conservative groups in the united states right
hi good evening
colombian
yes i've had to be honest i hope that technology keeps on advancing because i think that in ten years what else are they coming up with right
you know this has to keep on advancing right
mhm mhm
na sure yes
mhm sure
exactly yes
ah yes that's true aha
now sure sure aha
ah yes it's true
yes
oh but you talk like a mexican
mm
that's right

uh huh uh huh
it's true because he already has cancer for some years
and they haven't found a cure have they they haven't found it have they
yes yes yes
uh huh aids now that it's spread through so many places
yes that's right
aha
yes yes
uh huh yeah
no no no no it's true
i see
yes
goodclear
i think not i think that that something will arrive that that god shows for that will arrive something that can cure this cancer catastrophe the age is not important but it will be but it will arrive right
that occurs in anyone
yes already
oh my god in three days oh
ah ok of course
oh my god
oh wow
oh my god
mm
oh
mmmh
mm mmh
ah how great
aha yes
ok of course aha
good evening my name is caroline
yes because tonight's subject is technical gadgets
ya
mhm
yeah right
mhm
mhm ya right
yes
very slow yeah
yeah of course
yeah of course
what alex
mm mhm
mm ya of course
well for me as well of course and i work my jo i am an administrator and so uh my job i use it and for me the computer i mean the
the most essential and above all uh and in the new techniques no the new technology that has arrived and each day newer things come out no
then the truth is that i have adapted very well and i have loved it since i am using the computer well um before when the typewriter was used it was so slow to
type documents and reports and all now everything is done by the computer and the internet no i mean that is it something marvelous
for me it's essential i think that i wouldn't know what i could do if without the computer no so the truth is that i am very happy with this new technology and hopefully it continues
advancing more each day no
it's true
uh huh yes and for everything no i mean that it's everything that one
oh well i'm from new york
wants they find it there and well when one sits at the well i or use it for my work but well also and when i am at home and i need
some information well i sit at the computer and there is no one to stop me i don't know that when someone is already like something an essential part of one's life no
for everything because if you need to know how the temperature is outside well you go to the computer
before it was so mhm
yes yes yes
oh yes also oh
right of course and how many calls have you made already
oh and uh so you're finishing then
oh right right
right right
ha
mm right
but and the payment is made after you finish the twenty five calls right
yes oh right right yeah
oh yeah
oh ah you know the owner
oh that's good
oh he's from is he from california
oh okay
ah but you know him personally
oh only through the computer
oh okay nice to meet you
through the internet okay aha
oh okay oh yes oh no i never talk to him i
oh yes
oh
yes
i see i see i see
i see sure and
yes yes i knew and besides yes i think that they are also going to start another one after we finish this one
hmm
oh this is your second one oh is it
well we got this night the technical devices
oh oh
i see i see oh and was the other one the same twentyfive phone calls
i see and they paid you as well the same
oh i see i see
ah how wonderful
of course
mm yeah
oh uhhuh
yeah
we of course sure it is
i'm from peru
exactly aha
exactly
aha
oh but here in
of course but here in the united states
oh ya of course yes yes just know i have received one ah of verizon that are offering me to make free calls here in the us
and they give it to me and meanwhile the charge me
yes of course
ay how great
yes right
and you
how great right like so it would be excellent to make country calls there when one wants i think it will come because with that thing about the cards too right every day
it was expensive before did you remember before to call the country of
now it is really cheap of course
yes that of course
now you can speak three four five hours for five dollars
it used to be a minute back then oh my god it was like eight
and yes i remember that when i had to call i think i would only be able to speak for ten minutes and that would cost me around twenty five dollars
and so i had to be keeping track of the clock no
yes aha
aha sure aha yes
yes good evening
mhm
because there's there is a lot of demand
technology is advancing it is advancing
i would love to see
more advanced technology with medicines
you have to look for cure to illnesses like cancer eh yes you can go to the moon so why can't they find a cure for cancer yes it can be done if they can do a
super fast computer one can think why aren't they looking for a cure for cancer
i want to see some advances in cures for illnesses i think that area is way slow
i've not seen many improvements in in cure for illnesses in the past ten twenty thirty forty years
ok
yes how many people right kills
because here we speak mexican spanish
they haven't and this shortens the lives of many people
or or heart disease too
aids is more advanced than cancer in in
in the sense of being controlled because they already have drugs to fight it
but cancer goes more slowly it seems to me
have you heard of a discovery of a cure for cancer
me nothing nothing
very slow
the can improve this
yes
because of that
yes yes
i i had a friend that died young at 31 years old and had cancer from one day to the next
and he died in three days
yes but that day hisbrain was bleeding
and he died immediately she had leuke leukemia of the blood
and from this he had one day for another
mhm and there was nothing they could od
not that not it
you catch the you catch the accent from where you live
with the when i lived in spain i caught the a the spanish accent
when i lived in colombia i caught the colombian spanish from bogota especially
now it is the turn of mexican spanish
because that is what is spoken here
ay ah i believe that hispanics here are about ninetyfive percent mexican
yes
oh how are you carolina do you talk to alex
yes ah i use i use computers
ah ah i have the d s l very rapidly now
yes and it fascinates me because i like the internet fast i don't like to wait websites
so for me it's very useful because i look for jobs i do surveys look for women
a lo lots of things and and i don't like to wait for the websites you understand me
i like to do it fast and before when i was in line in the phone
it was really slow
so i had to wait two or three minutes only for one webpage to appear
and until now well i have a webcam and the webcam is really fast with d s l
the webcam is when they can see you like tv co video conferences
from los angeles
it's fast
and you
yes
mm of course i think that they have e they have done more a advances on the computer than they have on with medicine
the computer is the most advanced of the civilization now
yes
yes exactly
news sports
oh going out with women everything
no and even in this poll that we're conducting i found it on the computer too
oh okay i thought it was somebody else sorry
yes almost mm then the computer has a lot of influence
in our lives twenty two that's crap uh twenty two calls
i almost i have to do about three but o one call that the person spoke more in english so i i think i'm gon na have to replace it
bu but who knows
because i spoke in spanish so they should count it
because if you speak in english no they don't count it
yes you do a a call to replace
i went to talk to him i know the owner of this
and and i will ask him if i have to replace it
yes
i am from los angeles
yes is easy is easy talking to him
no he must be in philadelphia
but but he gave me the tele
no no no no
yes i know him through the computer but he
but he he talks to the people that are participating
yes then if you have any questions you can he's chinese
yes well i don't know if he is the owner he is
the the manager
yes that by supervisor of the project they are pursuing
nice to meet you
yes and it is that they are studying how we speak spanish
i don't know if you would kni if you knew
no i don't know it but most probably yes because i i al i have one two already
one in english and the other one in spanish
yes and this what we are doing now is technology
because they are doing connections over the telephone
and this is techonology yes something like that it was it was the same thing but in english
and they paid the same
yes i like doing this not only for the pay but it gives me opportunity
to speak spanish
where are you from
because it's the o the only time during the day that i speak spanish
i i speak very little spanish now most of my day it's english
yes
and what other technology do you use what we're doing now is technology
you couldn't do this twenty thirty years ago what we're doing now
because they're using multiple phone lines to connect many people who live in different part of the country
i believe that phone technology has made advances also because i can make long distance calls and they don't cost me anything because you pay
uh a monthly fee
and you can make all the calls you want
and that was not like th that was not like that like in five or ten twenty years
oh okay
here in the united states yes
yes
if they charged you something monthly but if you make a lot of calls it is worth it
and you know what one day they will make it international too to your favorite country
you pay a monthly installment and you can make the calls you want
yes
and it is cheaper right
and why is it cheap because of technology
yes the technology
exactly
um i am from colombia
a minute cost around twenty cents yes
mm
yes yes yes i have been through that too
yes yes yes i know what that's like yes that you are going against the clock
yes but eh with with
because it's advancing and technology is now reaching more people
so services are cheaper they are selling it to more people
do you understand
eh for example the computer five years ago they were around two two or three thousand dollars
and now you can buy a computer for two or three hundred dollars
