hello
yes i'll finish soon
then there are many things like that as well then everything everything depends on on the course but
ehm yes here if there is and i barely write anything in general then it seems a little strange to me that i had to write
but uhm and what more and now and the and the time here it __ most probably you don't like it right
too mu there is too much cold here right
ys
__ yes
um
but
but in peru i was told there are regions were it's really cold
uh um
but but what
oh i see
well i'm in wharton
so business yea but so you're studying for phd that's masters exactly
oh its undergraduate oh okay okay
oh but are you here now
you live in peru right
do you live in peru
ah
so you're a freshman or
hi good night who is it
oh okay so you're not an exchange student you're transfer
ah how nice
yeah how nice and what do you think until now
yes but it's the english or the
all all the work
yes yes
yes
more than peru
mm
hmmm
hi guillermo
mm
ah ok ok
yes yes
yes but i mean it is still rather intensi
yes it is hard
um it depends and and in general five but ah sometimes i say ah no it is just it is like but in the end last cycle i only took four but now i am taking five
and but in general in in college people only take four
it seems to me yes but at wharton generally people take five
eh
yeah i have yes i have a little job there at the library it is work study but it is eh there really it is not a job because when i am there
oh i am josé
i study then it is not like that
mm
ah sometimes i used to do that but no but in in which are you in what part of the library in
mm ok ok
in lippincott
it is it is wharton's library
yes it is on the second floor mm no but yes it is there it is a good job because i only work and i don't work so much i work five hours a week sometimes i work ten hours a week but
it continues being like that i do my homework actually then it is not so well there are there are times towards the end there is a bit more of work because
there are more people who need help and everyone
is doing their research and but in general it is very no i don't have too much work
oh but i live here in philadelphia
but yes here it is eh but what i have seen is that for example i sometimes from ah in latin america but you see that in europe
at the university they give you during eh well in general there is not that much work only in the end right then teachers
eh yes in europe in general right
hm mm
hm mm
yes yes yes
yes well well well they well don't don't give too much work but eh in general they want that you well you're supposed to right that that you are
like that that you read everything that you do the exercises and keep on doing all that right
understanding everything right and then at then end they give you a test and that's your grade but here in the united states it's
different right because here specially in history you have to re research and then an essay then another thing and another and a test and
yes yes how about you
it's it's better in the sense that you ok there are less risks but there
the wor yes yes but
yes
yes
yes
yes yes yes but the task they gave me i mean one week you have one thing then another
other task then another task
each system has it own advantages but in peru how is in general
hm mm
hm mm
oh what are you studying
hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
hm mm mm
yes
hm mm
yes yes
yes yes
hm mm hm mm
yes hm mm hm mm
oh i'm studyin here as well i'm senior
yes yes
yes
yes yes
yes well it's it's different because in wharton well it also depends well depends because for example i say the classes that i take in general don't have
essays like that nor research just in general two three exams and and that's that but there are classes for example that have more like one has the two exams but also one has projects
these like case studies
in groups in general these days almost everything is in groups and of course if they give you homework things little things so that you keep on revising because if not
because and and and i like them like that for example each week to have a homework small that you have to turn in because in that way
you hav they make you study every week right
but that that that i like sometimes they do that but in general they are exams or projects but in
pennsylvania university as well
each class there's always an exam i don't i've never had a class with just projects right but in general two exams and maybe one project
in the then now in the class of we have of marketing we have a a project that is like a eh i i don't know how they did it eh eh and
they created a whole software that it's like a simulation and then you for example each order there are like five orders or six orders then
you have a group
and then everyone each group gets a a company
then one has several products this company has several products then one has to decide bases on on each product then where are we going to from what type of
ho ho how are we going to see this product let's
place more yes yes it is it is like that how one one is in a com of course that it is not like that like in the real life but
it helps yes yes it is not it is not interesting but then to __ then it is later when that ends he has to write several like that essays to make an analysis
of what did one do of the of the mistakes of what one did well
hi
oh great
i would say that i mean i remember one time i must have gone to peru's range and it was like on vacation with my family and yeah every night
it could be even colder than what i have experienced here so far
and you what are you stuyding
hm
its um no undergraduate
hm mm hm mm hm mm
sorry
i sorry what so you mean
i mean i lived in peru three months ago
yeah um
no its just that i studied two years in the university of peru and then i got transferred here so i'm an international transfer
hi i'm guillermo how are you
yeah i'm going to graduate with the title of this university
unlike a student exchange for example no
eh the truth is a bit difficult
tight in english english in fact is one of let's say
it's a difficulty like eh i did studied in english most of my life but anyway i find it difficult talk in english compared to castillanspanish
no like that is clearly for me
eh but aside yes by the amount of work that i'm they send is also a
i yes i think that yes they send you more
more more than in peru including the last cycle i in in peru with at my university i took six courses eh in a semester
and including that way i think i had a lot less work compared to what i have now with five course
yes
it's okay what happens that i'm taking five courses and work too
i don't know suddenly this is equivalent to carrying six classes something like that
suddenly it is a a little less i don't think that it is so so so demanding as carrying six courses but
i believe so yes i don't know suddenly in the future decide d
of i i i will decide to carry fewer courses i don't know you about how many courses do you take per cycle
ok and and you
ok
i understand and besides you work or
do you dedicate yourself full time to to your studies
ah it seems very advantageous what in what to what what do you do in i also work in the in in the library but but i am a shelver
hi where are you from
then really it does not give me the chance to study
on the fifth floor of van pelt
you where do you work
where is that
ok
hm mm
hm mm
ah in in in england for example
yes i have also heard that i mean the amount of for example of the the the number of hours that they ave per class a week
they are i think less than three
in philadelphia
so one has a lot of free time i mean he doesn't have many classes
an apart from that i think that that yes i mean they don't give you too much work no i'm not sure no no no
sure hm mm hm mm
hm mm
yes of course that that that that that definitively that's an advantage no right that there are fewer risks
because really image that for example you wen to to to to to to determine your grade on a class in one test maybe the night before you couldn't sleep well or
anything could have happened and suddenly
you don't do so well in the test i mean maybe you would have prepared a lot but for x reason you didn't do well on the test then
i mean lets say the grade is going to
the grade is going to be lower i mean i don't know
i'm peruvian i'm studying at the pennsylvania university
yes yes yes
let´s see i can tell you they gave us that task must be as a midterms
i think everything is about lecture controls
let's say along the semester
and for a few courses no all they ask you at the end of the course an essay investigation task
and also the final exam but you don't have to work as hard as here
i mean you don't have to write that much
here they keep you writing all the time papers and reviews isn't
not so much over there i mean over there rather you had to write it for example you wrote it or in the exam or or to turn it in i mean the research
at the end of the semester but other than that no no you didn't have to produce much
eh i study history
and well i mean that could be seen as advantageous in the sense that you don't have they don't no they don't ask so much of you right i mean
you can live a bit more relaxed
but this point the disadvantage is that you don't you don't practice your your your your no you're not in constant practice of of the work
of research and neither of of how to write right i mean sometimes for not writing so much you loose practice right to write so
that's what i would tell you i mean it's more it's easier no i mean
it's easier but i don't know if it's let's say if they form you as well as they form you here
but it costs your form i mean the the cost is that h here they form you better it's good but at least i for example this weekend i'm full of things to do so
you live a bit more well at least i live a bit more anxiously let's say a bit more
stressed
but i don't know how wharton will be i don't know
at what university
aha
and are they products like individual or in groups
sure
hm mm
hm mm hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
oh that is interesting
but that is it is similar in something at least
hm mm
oh really
hm mm
i see
what
well yes yes yes yes on on tuesday i think at night that it was raining
i froze yes that is i have to go with my jacket i mean with my i have eh i i bought a light jacket that is quite warm
and i have for that is i always go out with it but even like that even sometimes using the jacket i also get cold no but well inside my dorm it is much more ehm
tolerable thing inside the dorm yeah the temperature is it's it's enough for me
not warm
well yeah if you go to the east range
also at night mostly well if you go to the range during winter at winter uh the winter nights on the range are very cold yeah
hello my name is gloria
of ah okay am i'm a catholic so i think i believe that they divide some and unite some for example one of my nephews is gay
really ah yes i think she is from georgia
yes from atlanta yes yes yes yes
ah in ah
ah okay okay yes one of my nephews lives there in georgia well she moved she still lives in georgia but she had to sell her house cause she and her husband got a divorce
so she had to sell her house and she is now alone yes
yes my niece yes she is about fortysomething
yes
then they in the catholic religion don't accept gays
because god didn't make them like that but yes i remember when my my nephew was born from age one we already knew that he what he he was going to be
people don't believe they are born like that but he was born like that and only if you have someone in your family is that you know so he
has many problems with the catholic religion because they don't accept him and he knows they don't accept him but he finally found a church on thirtysecond in new york that accepts homosexuals
mm aha
mm
aha
mm
exactly
from new york
mm
mm
mhm
aha aha
yes yes yes like this one what was i going to say i at the lunch hour i to the ladies where i work where i work three
i take this a book that is by joyce myers and the ah everyday scriptures and i read it to them so they say to me ah that is shit that i say but
listen to what she is saying hear that you treat your neighbor well like you you would like to be treated ah no i have no reason to treat her well
i don't like her i say but the whole world is created in the image of god ay we began to fight so i say look i want peace because what happens is of everything and i why don't we
talk about the the the theme of the day but forget about it it has become but they still look for me so so i can read everyday
because there is one who is like a firecracker and i was telling her that i don't want to be around her because she takes
from long island
all of my energies and she is always criticizing the whole world and i don't want to be in that environment she says if i read to you every single day the other days you are telling them
write five things that you are grateful to god for eh am what you think of yourselves forget about it she always ay you are always reading something religious that
i say that is the only thing that has saved my mind because if not if i was to criticize that the whole world criticizes me and i know that i am a good person and god me like i am
if i let people take me they would have thrown me out of the window by now
and that is what happens to her they criticize so to her i say look god wants you and how you are but you have to you can't keep criticizing the whole world
yes
right
yes right
right
yes yes yes yes yes yes
from long island
right right
it's just it's like he uh uh precisely the catholic religion everyone's going like m my friend went to another church she says to me
this that and this and that and i say you have to find the church where you want what you believe conforms you
or that in i am not going to tell you to go to the catholic church if it's not giving you anything because i go to the catholic church
so then she she found another church she tells me maybe you should go with me i say no leave me where i am i'm pleased where i am
and you know i go to the charismatic groups so then n n i like to go to other churches i am not going to tell you that i don't go but i don't want her to
i already had gone to that church many times before and it took all day on a sunday and i don't have all day on sunday to be there
three hours four hours
right
oh i thing christian science or something like that
aha
yes yes yes they are like born again christians or similar
something like that yesso you know she was catholic but the husband go to the catholic church i am the only one who go to the church my baby doesn't like to go i am always discussing with him in order that he goes to the church
and he doesn't think that god is helping him so i tell hime every day all of this god gave it to you like today we were talking about
katrina and he say god did it what
and i wasn't able to convince him that god did it that was an act you know act of god as the people say but
god itself he won't leave them even the bible said that is going to happen things like that so i was telling him maybe the bible is going to show you what is it
mhm
ok yes
ok
ok ok yeah
oh from georgia oh my god
exactly they just sit there and when the priest finished they go away running
yes
this yes yes how lately i am going to a charismatic group so i'm understanding more even if they say it in spanish and i don't understand i can speak in spanish but i can't read or write
so therefore they gave me a spanish bible and i forget it i'm reading it but i don't know so i go and explain it to them i read this and this and this
this is what therefore they read in english and i see if i can understand but it's very difficult the bible it's
exactly exactly so i find it really difficult so i they give me some passages and so i read them and then they tell me this is this and this and this
you know and they begin to use it in our lives and i say oh ok so i understand
i'm puero rican
yes yes yes yes i was born in puerto rico but i grew up in new york in what they call the barrio in east what they call the barrio in manhattan
yes you know have you always been from georgia
i didn't understand what she said
oh from chile oh okay
but you live there
oh
wow wow wow wow
wow
right right
right
wow you travel a lot
right that's good that's good to move like that you see i live
i lived in manhattan then i lived in the bronx and now i moved to long island and we stayed here however when we retire we'll live i guess
it was something about religion she said we had to talk about
in florida because my child my old child and my grandchildren live in florida
so i would like to go i would like to go to florida to be near them but by the time i go there maybe my grandson will be married
because he's already seventeen years old by the time i retire that's 10 years more he'll be twentyseven maybe he'll get married
i'm going to be the
yeah
ha
oh where there is work and what do you work in
oh oh you're at home with you're kids that's good
oh my god yeah yeah its a lot of work right i do children parties i dress up as a clown and now i'm trying to imagine how to make elmos head
because i have the bodysuit but
no
the head is my friends so me and her made that party and then sometimes they ask for two and we couldnt go one can only go
so i've been trying since then my friends making it but its very heavy so i don't know what to do with the head
so and apart from that because that's why i wasn't hearing what the lady was saying and i said i'm doing lots of things i have to concentrate
all at the same time because they sometimes call and they don't call and sometimes i get it and i dont and i already had they had given that discussion last week i dont know why they discuss over the same thing
you know have you been doing this for a long time this
oh like me yes me too yes
oh okay yes
ah i found i have a friend named norma i think she lives in georgia too
yes yes yes she is from peru peruvian yes
yes yes yes i've spoken to her four times i think
hello
she was talking about religion what is our opinion on religion if it helps unite people or if it divides them if we should all be of the same religion or what do i know
aha
yes good i think that as far as religion that if people followed their religion there wouldn't be so many problems like in the case of those when they go to extremes in no matter which religion
if people followed for example those who follow jesus christ if they followed the teachings of jesus christ and if they acted how jesus christ acted
there wouldn't be so many problems
but when they start fighting that's not what he taught
jesus christ
where there are problems
same with the muslims
or the jews the principles of of those religions and what they teach
hello gloria i'm paulina where are you calling from
in itself is they are good things but when the people become fanatic and don't accept all the other people one respects the differences
i think that that is when there is division problems
how good
yes
and it is the truth it is the same whe the
in a one on one relationship or like religi like village like for example what what is happening in israel between the
between the palestinian and the
and the jewish
it's sad and they're always fighting
because there are sacred places for both of them but they don't respect
new york i'm in georgia
other people
oh yes
what religion goes is your friend
oh
ok
mhm
mhm yes
it's like that i find that in terms of religion many people just go by tradition and
when you go and search the truth
and you really search you find a religion that
ah
you like it but many people who also go just for tradition they don't even know about what is their religion
yes or the don't study the writings for themselves nor anyone
yes it helps when one starts to study to believe that it's one's own religion
the bible yes the bible is difficult the vocabulary it uses in any case it doesn't matter what language i find
mm where are you from
puero rican but you grew up in the united states
ok i don't know
no i'm from chile
yes i grew up in chile and when i finished the second year of high school i came to study in the university at

for relaxation
ehm i have a ehm a list ca ehm on the contrary for me ehm to study i can not have that type of music i can not have classical music i need music
that it has lyrics because it if there are not if it doesn't have lyrics it is like it bores me i need something to distract me
twentyfive
eh eh with i work with virus
in biology
so that i always need something to distract me that that keeps me alert
yes yes if i play music like classic no
i i fall asleep i have i play classical music when i have many times when i have to eh if i have to write a a report that i have to focus a lot a lot a lot
well then but always since i was little when i had to study i always played music and while i sang i could be reading and my dad always he criticized me that i
it is impossible for a person to be able to read and sing at the same time but i don't know it always worked for me i always had good grades so
i guess that
no
yes that i don't it doesn't attract me at all music i mean eh you can
okay pardon
twentyeight ah me too
good evening
aha
and you
above all i like live music i like it a lot
live music
aha
okay
aha
exactly
exactly
exac
yes how are you
exactly exactly no yes i always i because i no eh i play my instrument and my husbands plays his instrument and at least ah maybe some that are festivals and things like that
there is a bar near my house where many people come to play every night nothing people sit there and play an instrument
and there are open circles every night and there are songs of where people play and then on weekends different music groups come
to play every night of in on weekends an it is really cool
i like everything
at least i like eh what don't i like at least yes rap hip hop i don't like or at least music ah pop
so if it is britney spears and that no i don't like it it doesn't get my attention at all
i like ah i like a lot ah this at least spanish rock i have many spanish rock songs and bluegrass so
well i like at least spanish rock i like fito páez a lot
who is from argentina
ah i'm josma from philadelphia
yes i do like him very much
and ah mm i music like american music there is a man whose name is he is very good
and he that they died ah that also he was very very singing but at least around here where i live there are many people who play
many friends of ours who play and sing and have bands
and all the groups they have they are they are very very good also
well and i at least this year i went to a concert of ah willy nelson
and bob dylan
and there were people of all ages there were people of even sixty or seventy years and there were children of ten eight years old at the concert
yes and well very fun they are in a small stadium in a in a small baseball stadium and there wasn't yes there weren't many people but
but it was very good very good the concert
how is it going
more yes that everything we buy music but we also buy many music of groups so that that that they are not very popular that is people that we know
yes because we are members from one of the ah music society folklorica from philadelphia and then at least they have many musicians
they are members and have concerts in the houses and all that all months
there is a concert in in a house of a member and we all bought all those cds
of groups that we see that they are not too super super famous but they are good
and at times we have seen for the least groups that we
us know that we were famous and all of a sudden the what we are hearing in a festival or something
and all of a sudden we hear a song that is famous
but
no no no my husband used to play in a groupbecause that is that group is not togethermaybe they will get together again
of the music fine ah i listen to some latin music and some american music yes folklore and bluegrass country music
but no we don't play for any group or sometimes my husband plays with his friends but what happens is that we don't don't have time like that for
for for committing ourselves with people
because of work and that we we and and then we don't have time commit yes with a group because if you have a group you have to rehearse at leas a day
week
yeah
so yes you have to give it lots of time and the at least the there is a group that wants that my husband plays with them
but where they meet they meet on wednesday night at around ten at night and then the rehearse like until two in the morning on wednesdays
since he has to work and in school and that he doesn't have any time
mm
that happens to me that i do spend a lot of time without singing a song i forget it but i i was the other time i was talking to a friend and
twentyfive
and we were with her listening to a song on the radio that i hadn't hear like for eight years and she remembered the whole song
and after they aired a song that i have not listened to and it had been about four years that i had not listed to it and i knew the song and
knew that i knew the song but i did not recall the the lyrics of the song bu i remembered but a little not much i do forget it if not if not
if i don't listen to it the whole time i forget the lyrics because of that i know the song but i forget the lyrics a little bit
aha
aha
exac
oh and to study
yes
what what do you study
mm oh twentyeight
ok
ok
exactly
mm
i had a teacher
that said that when no this i was studying something like that that you have something that you have to learn that if you sing it you have to learn it you learn it better
fast than if you read it normally
twentyeight
ah
hi you are talking with fabiola
yes i say the same
we bought them at jcpenny
they are arriving little by little yes the curtains arrived first last night another part arrived a bread the top part
then i received the other top part and i still need they have i need three mor curtains more that have to arrive and have not arrived
the living room / dining room because i didn't put them i didn't put eh how do you say it blinds
no because the rest of the home i installed blinds but to the living room / dining room no because the windows are not windows they are picture windows
then they don't don't exist in that size unless you have them made exclusively for that
ok the best that happen to me it would have been know my husband
and the second best thing that happen to me it would be have children
being healthy
and for real
yes
why its all right about good themes so we find good themes for talk when you speak there because they also put you the music that it was yesterday
yes i was entertaiment we talk twelve minutes and they cut you
if they tell you that you have thirty seconds to say goodbye
so we have twelve minutes to speak about what we want because they know are voice
and that's how it works and they pay you then
there is something to talk talk about what they say or what you want the idea is speak because they are recording all the talking
who is who
by the accent the system eh the form of talking and
the ringtones of you and are inventing something
so people are needed who have different voices
and the
yes all the girls connect through this number
if you talk at the same time at the same hours
and and connect then connect well
yes but i don't know if you can make two calls at the same time
cool or not that is the subject i told you to talk and they give you a topic of conversation
so i don't know if you hear the voice of the beautiful children
it sounds very very clear yeah
are being are they doing that to be laughed at
look and laugh and say hey you look like my no no no you'll like my
children are entertaining ahh they are growing do you talk to them
have you got them to speak now or not
if you talk do you talk to the children
in english
ohh
in english that is good because they will have two languages
about the best thing that ever happened in your life
yes
he imagine me a geni with two languages also eh talk to me in two languages ehh he already can read the two languages but all the same has an accent and spanish is difficult for him
and although since being a little girl and her first three years was born here
but at her two months and a half i took her to chile and in chile the same
she learned some words only but she could not say complete phrases because he
we used to come every year for vacations and stay a month here
and the father always spoke to him in english
yes sure and the eh he and when she listened listened a bad spanish from michel
or a bad english from me
now i speak a better english michel speaks a better spanish and she can read both languages and she is better but yes she she get confused when daddy
and how has your life changed
speaks with accent and a very strong accent
isn't that bad
is not good right
yes from the fourth month kids start to
have you planned what you shall do for christams or thanksgiving
yes
yes
are you preparing the chrsitmas presents and so
the christams persents are you plannig them
not yet
and what is the best thing that ever happened in your life
the kids will be big already grown by christmas they will ply already
how beautiful
we're thinking of buying the tree
alive like every year we buy it alive
emm we're going to see no we'll see michel i bought him a car
yes
a big remote control car
it was a hundred and sixty dollars i found it on sale for fifty dollars
it's a james bone
it is james bone and a remote control i'm going to give it to him as a gift from santa
but the best thing you feel that has happened in the life
and for jenny i'm still looking for it there is something that she likes a lot and it is a game boy but a new one
that you you don't use little keys you touch the little things and it starts moving
a new one a super new one that was just released
so i think i'm going to use that one for her because i know that's what she wants
a karaoke machine
yes she sings well because of her age she reads the lyrics in the screen they light up they change color
so she sings the song
she has fun with it i tell her it's good for her because she will practice her reading she's preparing herself for christmas and my fatherinlaw
i bought her a present on jonathan's behalf
it's a
that is a good subjet
for the computer it's used to move the mouse around
you move the mouse and there's a calculator
no no no the part where you move the mouse is a little square
and that
so i bought one for my fatherinlaw and one for us from jonathan
huh and you think that another good idea and i don't know why
no we bought the tickets already we're going to arkansas we're going to arkansas to spend uh fifteen a week
yeah every year we go a week
ohh yeah
no but it hasn't started yet then
yes
of course but maybe it isn't true that it isn't and it's not true that it is
they told him that they have the personnel in case of anything they'll let him know
is like we'll call you later
but it turns out that the job in chile still hasn't started
it still is i also got emotional i tell michel michel if we get it we leave
michel yes yes but
eh the same as i think i tell him but how are we going to go if we just boug the house how you tell me
we sell it well and it makes me laugh because for him it is like so easy like nothing else to get rid of take things and get rid of them
and for me it is rather difficult
yes then put it together i tell you that i still don't put the curtains up those curtains are arriving little by little
hello hi
i think it was to meet someone because if i had not known
eh
and are they are those curtains for the living room or
ah you didn't install blinds
ahh
especially for
wouldn't these children be here
yes because how
yes
yes because i wouldn't have to know the kid i wouldnt be here
other people wouldn't have these children and i didn't know you neither
if it wasn't for him neither
yes
he they like me
oh
and they connected you so it will work
but how do you called to this there is nothing about to talk they say
ah so that after the computer knows eh
and by the for the accent
mm
yes so
ahh no idea and i had not called because i said you can not call
earlier
yes
ehh
then i try to call later or in the middle of the day or at best i don't know
oh look yes also
on the same day
if you hear that then they are here
both are laughing
both are sitting here sitting on my legs facing each other and laughing
and the one that has the pacifier tied the bib and then throws the pacifier which stuck to the strip
ahh
what
yes yes i talk to them i speak to them all the time
in castilian
and he speaks to them in english
then we must talk about the memories
if it is so so then the languages will grow with god
because yes and also they grow with a not having an accent
eh
m
where did she learn to speak did she learn when she was in chile yes then
ahh
ah
ah then she was like confused
m
ah
ah
the the bad thing i am doing i mean i speak in castillian but the bad thing is for example when i am with another person and they speak english
i speak tothem in english understand
why not but it may be bad since my accent is understand
and i know they are little now and they won't they won't talk now but oh maybe they are recording it all
but
for thanksgiving we will have lunch with my with armi's grandparents of armi they come back for lunch because my
my mother in law is fixing the house
so we will have to go where his grandparents and them together

hmm
yes
something like that
oh
you would leave
m
eh
because it took a lot of time to find a home
eh
m
hi
yeah
well and what subjects more than anything
yeah
ah okay i see
yes
ok i see
mmm
yes
yes
mmm
yes of course
yes exactly
ah okay
yes but i know that in high school they start to specialize more the subjects and well chemistry and physics are more advanced
aha
yes
yes
yes yes yes
yes no
hmm
hm
yes i have heard about that
do you study or work
a lot very good good luck
but yes like you say as well that is only is two years old no we don't have to think that much about that yet
aha
mhm
yes ok
ok
mhm
yes now reads
yes
yes knows the order
oh that's so cute
yes that's good
yes sounds very interesting
that i do not know anything don't know how or if i had a situation i would not know what to do because i could never imagine how
give classes to my son i could not do it because also i say the truth i'am not so eh no i did not have an education to give classes you understand me
i imagine that you have studied something like education something like that no
o what do you study
yes no
yeah
sure suresure what aquire in all all schools gave classes
mhm
yes that's good of course
yes of course a lot of work at home i imagine
i'm glad but you're very happy i imagine right
yes hes four days old
wow that's a little bit
hes young hey so why are you in the united states have you lived here your entire lie
who's there
okay
mmm
mmm
okay
ah okay
i see
ah okay
oh a really little girl
oh okay
yes
hi anny i'm arturo
yes of course
and right now you're married to is it to a latino or to an american
ah okay i see
ah okay east of there in in miami i'm guessing
ah okay
okay
ah i see very well
and
and what and what language do you speak with with this with your good thing that right now you don't even talk yet your children the truth because
the other one is twentyfour months old right
where are you calling from
twentythree yes it isn't
mm
ok
ah ok
recognize them
ah yes
ah very true
wow aha
very rapidly
also i don't know or rather at what age children start speaking normally i don't know the truth
from miami great i'm talking from
ok
aha
yes yes
yes
yes
ah
yes but
sure yes it has to be much harder but but i think in the long run is going to be very good also like that they grow up with two languages which is an advantage
is true
mm
philadelphia
yes yes i can imagine
yes
yes ofcourse but they are very astute the children then no
know
mm
well yes hopefully and she maintains like that because then when she starts to grow up and and many of her friends speak english well then they will practice english more
ah okay
ah
aha
yes that is true
yes where are you from
but but what do you think of the that they will not have school companions that that
that is an experience too no like
aha
ah okay
ah okay
el
ah okay
yes
yes right that is what i was thinking at because yes is part of the experience no being in a school and know people
the i think that is important too is that it doesn't have to be that way when you are a child because the truth is you friends are very important
oh ok
i think no
but yes as long as i had a contact with other people unless one
yes there is many is because there is a lot of assistance to the community true and that
yes i see
yes yes yes i like in mexico that is so commun understand it doesn't happen anyway
then i don't know people lthat had come out from that type of schools you know and always i had curiosity like the law here in the united states because here is commun there is a different
what is out from the school in your house oh so far know i don't know
yes yes yes yes
yes it can be bad also
yes of course but it can be careful because invoices are not good safe
i'm mexican
can be bad
yes
yes yes
yes that is true until what grade do you think about going home schooling in your
yes
with time i will see that
but how do you think or rather you rather you think about all the primary or that
okay
oh yes
or you have you have taught classes all the way through high schools or what
hi
are you studying here at the united states
so i showed everything
so you know the only thing that if i don't know something
if i don't understand the subject or whatever then i teach myself to be able to tech the children
then you know like things like algebra
it's not that i don't know it but i might have forgot it
because i don't use it
then you know before giving hte class i remembered all those things
which was what i was supposed to do
then i could teach them
for me it isn't really difficult i know that it might be for someone else but it isn't for me
that's good
and also this time i know that now
they even have classes that that the children can take or the students that they can take on the computer
and they can go to a a high school let's say on the internet
so you know there are many many many options that it is not only from
you know one has to
that put him on a public school too
you know i know that the universities here
have ehm classes for children as well in high school that they can take in the university
so you know we have many options
and that
no i have a girl that's 23 months old and a boy thats 4 days old
no but as my husband says you know i'm a teacher
and i'm always reading books i am you know eh singing songs
to make her you know to entertain her but at the same time not be eh learning something always
so you know i'm not giving her formal school
but i'm raising her
little by little and she knows the alphabet well knows the song
yes aha so she knows eh the numbers
a little you know if i tell her she can tell me  two tre then the next one she knows that eight comes after seven you know things like
yes not at all but bit by bit
so you know so
so yeah i'm not working but
yes
mhm
well this
i studied yes education but they didn't exactly teach me how to teach lets say like teach a child how to read
all those things i had to learn while i was working
then i'am using the experience
yes but for that reason is that you know i for me for i do with me with my children
it is not a problem because i do not have experience i don t know you know how other people do it
not away from my house
yes
yes a little bit i'm tired right now but im very happy
four days
yes
yea my parents are from the dominican republic
my name is anny
and in 1970 something i'm not sure when it was exactly
oh i think it was in the 73 i'm not sure
but a revolution in santo domningo
they moved to puerto rico
then they spent more than 20 years there
then from there my sister when she started college she moved to florida that's when we also moved to miami
i had 5 years old i think
yes my sister is 10 11 years older
then you know we stayed and
i attended school here and well we made a life here
hi arturo
and
an american
yes i met him at university
no eh i went to
in
then i met him there
then
after ah
good
eh she's twentythree months and the other one is four days old
miami
what we do when he's not at my husband is not home
i completely speak spanish to my daughter
so when he is here we speak completely in english
and then she can be knowledgeable in both languages
and i i am surprised because a lot of times she says things
that i did not did not even realized she had learned
it can be in english or in spanish
and so like that she is catching on
yes
and mm i believe that she was that she had let's say fifteen sixteen months
where
as she's learning english and spanish
eh it takes the kids that do that it takes them a little bit longer to talk
so my daughter it took her you know her friends and whatever her friends
eh they spoke more clearly than her
ah until recently
so now she i knew that she understood and could talk
but since she had both languages it was a little bit harder
yes yes
so eh but you know she i knew that she understood
what i was telling her in english and in spanish
philadelphia
and now you know specially i know she understands me because when she doesn't want to do something she like plays dumb and i you know
i see the little face and i know she understands me exactly
yes yes
yes so but you know she understands it she speaks it
and
yes and no we aren't going to send her to school i'm going to teach her at home
because i am was a teacher
and so i think that for me to go to work and teach a you know sons or children of another person because of that i stay at home
and i can teach my own children
yes so
uh puerto rican
good
yes they have programs here in miami for the people that teach their children at home
the eh normally one time a week they meet each other
they is like a school maybe that that eh a clas sin a church or a university whatever but is like a school that meet every week
the yes you know that with their friends and all i have a lot of friends and families that did that
mhm and they don't have any issues
you know but is not something that
because to me it concerns me too i want that she can make some friends and all that
yes yes
yes yes
and you
yes yes
and also you know they have sports of of the other places in the community
yes you know things like theu said they socialize
ahh you know
yes
yes ah the that you know is like any other experiences like one is taking it you know can be good can be bad
but i also think that it is the school
yes that that alsoi want her to have friends and all dad to her and for her
yes yes
yes no i but for that reason i want to read becsuse i can teach anything and have to preparef for year
oh
you know
yes it is a little different that lets say like is presented in school
uhm i don't know i have not thought about it since he/she is only two years old
and i have not started yet
yes so then
oh it will probably be until until at least sixth grade
so then from there so then lets continue because i don't know but you know i i with my i can teach her until high school
oh
yes yes
eh well my well i was special education teacher
hello good afternoon my name is lorena i'm here in san antonio texas
because
positive and negative emotions then also not all is beautifull not precisely so i have a son that that have a problem a health problem and that's painful
so well however their emotions are kind and loving and the husband well the husband
that h as a lot to do with it a lot
in one's life no and this
but i one would think that it can't possibly be just one event
a painful event i remember a painful event the death of my mother for example
yes yes yes or having a sick child too that too
it's painful but as i say you can't say it's just one it's nice to try and think of one no
ah yes
hello eh so the subject of the present day is the most poignant right
exactly exactly mhm
hmm your husband where did you meet him
aha because you are spanish
aha yes
aha
yes of course yes aha
yes yes and and there are so many things and so many stages
well but this age when they are younger is the most loving
hmm is the most loving and well when they grow up and have their own lives for example well is nice but you don´t receive anymore the
today as a mom i did very well is i am and hear mom this is like at a conversation level like a level
exactly now i said well it's going to be the memories i said memories are as precisely the most important thing that can happen to you in life because you live of memories no
there is not so much dependence there is not so much closeness like
but it is very nice the truth is that it is very beautiful and then which is the best thing that has happened to you the best memory
yes
yes
yes it's true it's what i'm also feeling i thought about other things that have happened to me and one can have nice memories of achievements in life
like a person in sports or in academic life or in work no
yes exactly
exactly exactly and nevertheless one is accumulating
memories in pictures of christmas and the pictures of the school festivals and the pictures of the children's sports festivals
it's like precisely go building this life because it's made out of memories
ah
mm yes because this is like very like very complet like very you don't study to become a mom you don't study to be
be human you don't study to learn to love but in the end like it is the deepest and most complete emotion no
it is difficult to explain
but but you say that well that i had it because i wouldn't have wanted to miss it
a lot of energy it is
aha
yes yes really and she for example because because she is very mischievous
yes yes yes
that's right yes yes
and uh and then you really understand why uh why they're like that and all that having a strong and very active character will help them accomplish right
so the best is well i'm a mom
she will accomplish many things i believe
yeah with with all the difficult things that come across her the challenges
right well i have a daughter the youngest one that she's a little bit like that and she aside from being very good at school well she's an excellent sportswoman
can make her character too
like give it direction right um
and make her tired
yeah they need to wear off oh my god
where do you live
ah in philadelphia i have an older daughter studying at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia
yes yes yes so she's in philadelphia
and maybe yes if i would like to think the best thing that happened to me the best thing is that having children i remember the time when i was giving birth and i said this is the best thing that has happened in my life so i want
yes of course
yes but of course that is what she is going to do what did you study
uh huh uh huh
mhm mhm
that well it's a good decision
i support her have to take many vitamins to have all the necessary energy
and now you will see like when i spent more time yes i now my smaller daughter turned fifteen years old yesterday
then now when when you look back you have still many more memories many more memories more experiences of all her achievements also that are yours because
they achieved things thanks to the support that the parents can give and the dedication of well of everything you are giving up not like you say good well you are leaving to one side
maybe your most personal thing is your career your profession
i want to be consistent i mean with that comment that i made ​​myself in moment that were happening but nevertheless there must be other things
wonderful and you can't choose only one true
yes yes yes so
my name is mariza
yes
yes it's like no no yes yes but the kids the kids
yes
no
sure
sure the death of a family member a loved one it has to be the worse thing to happen to someone
yes that too
sure like the second part of the question what was it what would've happened in your life had you not done certain things that negative or painful event
i mean what would happen if that person was still here for example my mom still lives but my grandparents the two of them have been dead for a long time now
and i never got a chance to say goodbye to them because i was living far away so if they were still here life would've been quite different because they never got a chance to meet my husband or my daughter
hello
so yes
of course life would be very different
here in the united states almost by chance
and i do i´m spanish
and i came here to study with the study but i met him and at last i stayed here and i have twelve years here
and nothing i have a five years old daughter is i couldn´t tell him well my life has changed of course because children change our lives but she is so young that still has much
and then well nothing i don´t know is different when your children are older if they become more independent but i have still to go through that
and of course
yes yes everybody tell me the same
yes
right it's been hard to me to think which is the best and which is but
well i believe that the same as you to have children well i only have one and i don't believe that i don't know if i will have more
it was no no i mean i don't think i'm ready to be a mother because it was a really big change and the pregnancy was hard and the ah
he we have raised her my husband and me here alone so it was a little difficult but it was also clear that having a son changes lives so then it's the best that has ever happened to me
for now
eh nothing can be compared to that i say
of course
of course and and that is why the other question would have been different if that hadn't happened maybe if i wasn't a mother my life would be very different
the same i would have ended my studies i would have
of course gotten a more important career or i would have traveled more or met someone else but of course that can't be known only imagined
yes but
exactly with so eh with so and i don't know as much time passes more memories are don't know would not even know which one choose to start
oh
exactly yes all the pictures i have are thousands and thousands all of them are my daughter's that is why he
it is easy to say that it is the most important thing eh because besides that of course besides that well i don't know i have travelled a lot i have met interesting people but it can not be compared to
to children i guess
no
yes like i tell my sister she doesn't have children until you become a mother you are not going to know how to be a more let's say
more complete woman because they don't have they have been married twenty years but no they don't have children i don't think they are going to have them and then well it is difficult to explain
it is very difficult to explain one is not like they say
yes i had that's why i say i turned thirty and i say ok i think that it is time now that or now or or or we have one now or later i don't want to have one because
of course to raise a child you have to have a lot of patience a lot of energy and a lot
for example the best
everything yes yes and my daughter who is eh she requires a lot of patience a lot of sacrifice
and
she is very active very hyperactive and eh i don't know she is not a girl like i was when i was little i was rather quiet and i did whatever my parents told me not her she is more
she is like three sometimes she is
i end up tired after every day but well she's like that she's like that you have to accept your children the way they are
and
yes that's what i think or i hope that she
yes yes with if i compare her with my nieces who are very different i think that my daughter is i don't know she has a stronger character maybe it will help here in the future to do better
right
exactly yes that's what we want we also want my daughter to practice some sport but we want to wait for her to get older because at five years i don't know maybe she's too little but
yes me too
she has the body to let's say to be a sportswoman and maybe that will help her develop more and
yes
and and maybe she'll calm down
yeah yeah i need that because sometimes we go to sleep before her we can't take anymore yeah
i don't know there are some people that tell me it her age
right now we live in philadelphia
oh what a coincidence it's a good university
yes yes here is a city where a lot of people come to studying a lot of young people one of the most important that that is another important thing the education
eh and now
of course i would like that my daughter also went to university but i still have many years left for that
sure
i criminal justice well psychology but i didn't finish the degree
well after i was pregnant the girl we wanted to bring her up at home we didn't want to take her to a day care because we want i don't know it's the more traditional way as they raised me that they had me with each of my parents they took care of me
we don't want to leave her alone in a day care so in the
yes yes it's good eh
yes while one can now yes yes yes and
wow
yes
sure because that's what i was thinking and also i was wondering what would have happened it would be a different life now in that case of not having children
is is
hello my name is juan
well mmh look that i don't aha i have not paid attention to those those ratings
i end up not understanding them very well
it seems that they are eh a little complex they would better have a little more information than they have
no in general since i have little children
eh children then i don't worry much
for those ratings i worry in any case because when we are going to see a movie that is a movie that is worth it that has some interest and not go to any movie then the rating
i don't care as much as the quality and the comments i hear about the movies no
that is that is what catches my attention a little it is i don't know if this happens to you as well you always go with do you go alone or do you go with someone
aha
aha
nice to meet you too where are you at
aha
ah yes
yes
ah
aha
yes
yes
there's always something
yes that was not relates yes
yes yes i think that in that sense you could be very right
ah where are you
oh to me ehm look that strangely
what worries me the most in movies is the language and violence
regularly because like you say when there is an exaggeration in the language
or in the violence everything else is the same
so when the movie is like that r well obviously it is going to have like that scenes of all kind
those are free so more like r seems more than restricted it looks like if you didn't have much information about the movie it is exaggerated in all of the elements
yes
hmm
yes well look that
remembering remembering about the movies we have seen lately well all of them are
uhhuh
pg thirteen or something like that i don´t know where did he took them because the ones we have here
available in theaters right
they are they are simply not good
then not we we care a lot about that information as my children are teenagers we always go to the movies together but
we mostly go because of the movies quality
he in that sense the classification they have here to guide us about the movie well it does not really give information
we don´t care about it
aha
yes
yes no eh
ah okay i'm in texas in san antonio
that
yes
you see in that case when we for our kids' education
we've never done an act an action of censorship we
what we've tried to do is when strong scenes come up we try to discuss them no
we discuss them and we say if they were because that's usually what worries us we say hey that's bad we shouldn't have watched it the language was pretty ugly
we don't we analyze it and then we use it as part of our kids' education
in general it wor it works very well for us because or it worked not now now they're grown up
and what happens at this stage is that s he has a very good judgement about movies no and
uh huh
uhhuh that's where we are at hm
uh huh
yes
uh huh
yes
sure
yes no and it's that they'll always run into it on the way they'll always have the opportunity to watch all that
but the thing the thing that if talking about these questions is that the editing or the information that supposedly ought to be censored or
that type of thing never seemed a good to me because
well there is a lot of other information about the movies that are appropriate to go to see with your family
and after the movie mention all that happened and educate them regarding the type of movie the message the quality with which it unfolded etc etc
no yes
because the restrictions that they put well many like you say there is violence that is in a cartoon
there are cartoons that are for all the kids and have too much violence right
sure exactly and in those and in it and in general it seems to me that 80 of the movies are so bad that one should not watch them
no and as for the others well the best ones are mediocre and less than 5 are worth seeing
right but with these one already has a sufficient idea to have an idea of what there is to go looking
if there are enough one doesn't want to day that there are not enough movies but they do so many that there is no need to go to see all of them it's it's
no and then
if we would take the care of investigating who they are before going to watch a movie
read the reviews about that movie and then go watch one
it's like that's what we always try to do when we go out to watch a movie
uhhuh
and we have made a decision about which movies my kids since they were young they've been educated because my wife and i we love movies so
even when we were when they were younger
we would take them to watch movies even if they were movies for grown ups
and they would watch some scenes strong ones but a scene doesn't necessarily make a whole movie
so we would try to speak about the message no for example lots of war movies
lots of war movies are respecting the soldier's
uhhuh ah
well my name is claudia ivette who do i have the pleasure of speaking to
more like those that are they are like pg pg13 i've noticed
so i really don't understand much of this
aha
aha
yes yes it is true
aha
aha
aha
aha
no i am married i have three hears of marriage and the truth i do have a boy he is twenty months
oh nice to meet you juan
then he is about to turn two years old and the truth it worries me what we do well my husband more than anything
he for example if we see some movie and the truth we love it we like the movie for example if it is pg or pg thirteen
what is what we most watch we don't really like neither he nor me like to watch adult movies so
as far as pg thirteen
well sometimes one r but it really doesn't get our attention but for example if there is a movie that we like
we buy it and you have for example sometimes it has some nude scenes and that mi husband plays the movie and deletes that part
and he does it when for example sometimes neither him nor me will be at home so the kids can take he movie and watch it
and the my husband is going to record a commercial or something
then they can really watch the movie because there is not going to be better they can see movies about cars or full action
but for example he takes he deleted a part that was a little pornographic because you know that even if it's a good movie there's always a nude scene
from where you mean
and sometimes it's not related because
we have cars and action movies and suddenly it shows something that up and that's not related but
so that is what he has done because we are going to have other kids and sometimes they will be by themselves and then we can be sure that if they watch a movie
there won't be a problem but
yes
aha
ehm yes because it really
yes
yes
no yes
ah i'm here in the the states in idaho
aha no y and besides that for example we have found movies that are for em for children that is ehm they are not about children but to see they are
going from the one for children that is ehm supposedly the pg thirteen that is for children that are thirteen years old that can see them then but sometimes they say like you sa vocabulary and sometimes they air scenes
of nudity and that then i say ah how is he going to is seeing well
i don't know i am i am mexican
then and really there for example even ah like still in the television they care about you and even at the movies they care about you like a little of that
but i say ah i don´t know it does not look to me very
very fast hmm
aha aha
aha
not yes
it is in a place called robert east and you from where are you calling
aha
yes
not sometimes it does not tell you a thing because sometimes for example it says
and and for example changes things and when you are already watching it is is different at what it says
oh yes for example he says it's too violent sometimes it's not so violent it simply no no sometimes it doesn't really give you the information
then sometimes it doesn't
then sometimes you don't listen to it because because no and those for example
those things they sell for example they sell for television sets that that you see that
that remove the swear words or things like that well sometimes they work and sometimes they don't really work well i really don't have one
but i have a friend who has one and she says it really hasn't worked properly because sometimes it covers up the words words that are not curses and leaves the curses there
wow that's a little far
then uf
yeah
yes
yes
yes yes
yes
yes
yes look it's true that's a better idea i remember that my mom when we watched a movie as well we didn't watch a movie after ten at night because
we already knew that we could find
or my mom risked finding ugly movies
yes yes well i see we have well you see we have to touch on the theme of movies
of the type that it's no longer suitable for some kids but for example sometimes she said i don't know they played a movie and i don't know one or two curses
or something that isn't so nude but still for example few clothes and when we were little for example my mom
no daughter well soon you will understand more and she told us
because also as well then if one says no turn around no no you shouldn't watch that like then a a teenager or a kid starts to ah but why doesn't my mom let me
if it's a movie in the house and i'm going to watch because my mom didn't didn't let me watch that part
then i think that no yes yes
yes
sure sure i believe that
yes
yes yes that is true
well then much of the classification part i don't understand much about i know there are movies that are pg 13 pg
sure
yes and those are not upfront about the truth
yes sure sure right
yes
yes
yes that
yes that
aha
yes
aha
the truth is that i've seen some that really have more profanity that are pg13 ah they are like more violent and more
aha
yes
aha
aha
yes
good good evening i am joe
is always paying attention to what i watch and i don't want her to see programs that eh that are going to giver her nightmares or bad ah motivations but yes there is a lot
a lot of permissive things on the for example movies from outside because each time they are i now think it is more violent i don't know if
it's already sufficient for classifying it as they are leaving good violent movies with many themes
yes
i understand
i understand
like that movie that was about allies that left the war in iraq that thought that the soldiers that experienced it had left
it's about the black actor named jamie i think jamie foxx
and while this other while guy thought that he was traumatized or something with his experiences in iraq these things are very real and happen all the time
yes i'm sure
joe
yes
yes they were transferring many things out of the life that they told to invade iraq as being real ah now that one lie was not real
it's not worth what was done it has already killed more than two thousand soldiers
yes that's true
yes that's true well i i think that the current classification system is relative i know that kids of around thirteen years old they know what xrated movies are
right that's pretty obvious but this i think that nowadays they are stretching what is allowed and what is not eh eh i agree with the fact that
lots of movies right they don't have a sense of many of them are about gangs about lots of gangs or gang members and they go to watch them because it's like
they need to watch that kind of violence
yes they are pretty bad movies
and they kind of glorify it in a way
yes and what is your name
and that shouldn't be used as a way to sell
so that's why i think that those young kids are copying those ways of dressing or walking or expressing themselves it's like they've become their heroes
and that's so wrong that's destroying our young people those shows those movies they teach them false values it's so wrong but our
society the parents families they have a lot to do with it they should help the children understand what those things are and how to avoid them right i talk to my girl and i don't when
when i watch something like that i don't want her to see i don't eh i mean i try in a way to say okay don't watch that
or i try to teach them in a very educative way why it is not good for her to watch that show so instead of trying to force it upon her in other words
mhm
oh yes
yes it's easy
yes
alex where are you from
yes exactly well in my house i only have basic cable i mean i don't have any channel that that could go over the top
i don't i only have a girl she's five years old
so i have like a disney channel that she loves to watch and we also watch the discovery channel she really likes that and this other
comedy show that it's not that bad we watch them together because she loves to laugh she loves funny stuff
but when things go over a certain point if they go over the top well i won't let her see that because i don't want her to learn bad stuff
they use it to keep us entertained but when it's morally wrong or not socially right
yes e
the culture is more
viceos
yes all those things
oh yes yes yes of course i remember i remem
yes
yes
the teenage years are a critical age
exactly
it is that the way of reasoning and thinking they say we were teenagers too i remember how i acted in those years in
that i had a rebellious spirit and all those things but it is one needs the parents' guidance the most
yes and if you think about what's like when they're alone with their friends they can watch anything they want because there's no one there to forbid it
eh but if you help them giving them good bases about what's good and what's bad that will help them a lot to think before
taking a wrong action
exactly
eh what a memory yes yes i remember how not
yes
and they think they're independent that they don't need their parents
yes
yes the influence of kids today is very big i i agree although i remember i also had my my influential friend when i was a kid and all that
but i can see that because of technology and all that it's even bigger now because really movies in my time when i was a kid they weren't as violent as they are now
we also didn't have videogames tv was a lot more restricted we weren't taught about all this modern violence neither the blood or the body like the c s l and all those shows that are classics
that teach things like they are real
well like it is eh for young people their mind gets used to seeing that like it is acceptable but at the time when i was growing up those things were taught and would have caused chaos
in fact it wouldn't have been permitted at all but it is true the mentality is changing and because of that eh young people have a great deal of influence
big and negative of of these things that are allowed in society and i then
i am from colorado ah denver colorado
i i hope that when my daughter gets to that time of of adolescence then that i am
yes i know time goes by quickly
i remember when she was a baby and now she is jumping and running everywhere and learning many new things and she is curious and asking questions
well and what do you think about tonight's topic
yes me too i don't pay much attention to ratings besides that i am an adult of course i have a daughter who
yes good evening
yes no i i think that my interests in moves and television at times are based on the theme that they have
now if it's a violent theme and it doesn't have quality then it's not a good movie but if it has something along with the violence and if they are teaching something
like a documentary or something valuable about life
but one can't deny that the truth is the truth
one can't live live with closed eyes
yes
and these movies can be criticized politically
you always felt that the bush administration was obsessed with war
with iraq and cheating the public
it's those movies are important because most of the people are ignorant about the things that happen in wa in life
what is your name
they have no information
information the one we have is just propaganda so it's important to have another points of view of what is going on in the world and not just the point of view of the bush administration
mhm
those movies are wrong
they've got lots of violence
yes and they produce them not to teach us values but to sell
them to certain people
oh i i also have a fourteen year old son
and when he comes over to visit me i have to turn on the parental control on the sex channels
yes because he's obsessed with that when i go out to work he watches that
joe
so i turned on the parental control and he can't do that i've controlled it but i have it under control it was my idea to control it
it's not because of the rates so it's a parent's job every mom and dad must decide which shows their kids are able to watch and they can't put the blame on the classifications
do you have teenagers
ah yes a girl
yes you can teach your kids but the reality is that you as a father can't avoid reality specially when
they grow up because they will be presented with lots of temptations the ones that we didn't have
not because we are not good parents but because of the culture
because the culture today with teenagers are ah gangs ah hip hop music lots of sex lots of violence
videos
and ah it is not easy to control everything you try and you i try to explain what the consequences if they get into this
alex
if he wants to do that if he wants to have sex with a girl these are the consequences that that he might get what might happen you understand
you have to uh talk to them all the time because some things i have seen with parents because i am a substitute teacher in schools
they take care of the children a lot when they are five six seven eight nine ten years old but when they are growing up and need more help from the parents i don't know what happens to them
they start to fail and these kids have more temptation and
and it is at that teenage stage where you you have to intrude more in the life of the kid
not only when he is five or six years old
e exactly exactly then it all depends on the parents' education the way they care about the kids' lives not not on the classifications
the classification is only a number
yes
you have to give the kids some foundations what's good and what's bad not only when they're 5 or 6 years old but also when they're 15 16 18 years old
ah eh i am here in los angeles i think that we talked before about religion
and it's more important when they're 15 than when they're 5 because when they 5 they'll follow the easy rules
but when they're 14 or 15 it's another story my man
yes they have friends already they're involved in the culture
mom or dad have to work they don't always have time it's very hard
hmmm
yes
it is going to ti is going to be in a short time my friend
time flies
we talked on october fourth a while back already
where are you from again
oh yes yes
ah i i watch television by quality not not ratings
hi marisa i'm carolina from here from los angeles
it's complicated it is
the toic i was dying i would say
why why
but well thank god that you are not alone i hear so many people that say it is not that they talk but rant about him and i say
certainly people are already finding out besides that
they think that people are so dumb that they are not going to find
how many outrageous things that they are doing for the love of god
certainly
sure look yes and you know that just recently they ended the film festival for latin america
and indeed it became a movie in argentina but the directors were spanish
and then very interesting because you know that the spanish film also had many protests at the showing of the film
strong or even i don´t know if you casually have uh seen a page called uh tv for all
documentary style wherever you
and you can watch tv channels there
from all over the world including of course spain
it´s like this t v uh t uh v a four
yeah a four four and all a l l as in television for all something like that
uhm you can watch there and casually we uh have been watching a particular channel from venezuela
and it´s a channel of course it´s state owned but now really it´s owned by the state not like before that was owned by the state but almost as if it wasn´t
now we can see the really see the truth what´s really happening what they never told us and especially about our president who´s really
as we say in venezuela loud and clear
eh well well here it's good afternoon
i don´t know if you´ve had the chance of hearing him speak some time
exactly exactly then
aha the same
same here
but you know that those people unfortunately well no i mean they put what is convenient for them i
exactly exactly
correct correct and they play even this sometimes they twist
they twist what is happening and then always i find myself with people who for example tell me damn what do you think of the crazy man you have as a president and
i ay dear mother they went there again well the truth is that i with completely agree with that crazy man ah well i want to
i wanted to say that so later they have said a few stupid things no
ay i was thinking my god how can it be hey today we got a very difficult subject
and i ay my god i took patience lord because it is a really important topic delicate
even now i have had a several inconveniences here eh with even with with venezuelans
eh people who have been here many years and do not know what is really happening in venezuela
besides that they are afraid of the agreed idea what communism that i don't know how much fidel and that and the other and
well really i don't know how much knowledge do you have but this one for example the situation we are living in venezuela is a very especial situation
my own venezuela either way it has nothing to do with the cuban reality whit what happened in this cuba is how it is they are
they had to adopt that system ah what were the needs that carried them to undertake that system and what happened during the time in which
this they were applying because evidently they were mistakes as in all things just as we have mistakes right now
we have been making mistakes however for we are working based on that as the president says this clearly has a complaint against
the government not against the country but against the government here that are the one that
ay dear girl because i'm from venezuela
for they assume policies as it seems to them as best as it seems arbitrarily ah
exactly
exactly right or if not then i'll i'll bribe you
yeah then wow ah
right right then this a situation that is highly
delicate but i believe and from what i've seen the north american community is waking up in some way i feel
that there is a little more people that are realizing what is really going on because they also had them in a bubble
yes
sure
sure
where are you from
hm labeling continues and bad ones by the way
correct
exactly that is what they tell me sometimes  what are you doing here
and i say look i could be in venezuela and not support that president or the fact that you are in a
country or not or you leave your country does not imply you have a position
no one knows the reasons for those people being here
eh at a certain moment but that has nothing to do with the opposition because how many people for example in venezuela don't live in venezuela and what they really do is put them some enema
to venezuelan government and their people
right so you don't have to be here or there to support or not like it's a position very um to me when they tell me that way i get a good laugh
because what do you do over here all right could be same as you thank god you being here and not in venezuela
ah okay
right correctly no you could look at the gas prices problem like it truly was but look
for really unusual high price the people can't cope with that they don't protest either and i say my god what's happening with all those people like
supposedly you only react when your pocket is affected but it seemed like no i don't know what happens they must have been changing cars to get a more economic one don't know
i don't know what happens but they don't have like in general the necessity to protest before certain things
however i tell you don't know suddenly here you live in pennsylvania like you told me right
in philadelphia i don't know but here i have felt that there is a little more like people are starting to wake up
i feel that they are rejecting the policies of of of the current president and like they are seeing that really things are not how they are painting them to be because
me too at the beginning there wasn't i didn't have access to that to that page i said my good could it be true what they are saying about venezuela but i talked with my friends
and they said no girl what is that look and i damn really but look the power of television is
very big well precisely talking about that topic power
and you know right now we're living a very critical moment with the united states and the our new president
and television is a huge power
of course
correct
yes yes yes yes
of course of course what do you do there in philadelphia
ok
oh and do you think it is best over there than in miami
okay okay
of course of course and fi and come over here and what do you do
okay okay
and then ay dear girl
okay whatever whatever we can find of course
but and do you have much time here in the united states
twelve
oh my word i have been here six and and we are about to return god willing
yes of course
yes sir yes sir and
yes
ay my god
yes yes yes
yes and i believed that too a little and now i understand that is not that is like us because we don't have
wow
any fault of our what the government does
then i also before saw the americans like gringos then this one now i understand that don't that they are americans and united states because that is another wrong concept they manage no then
right we are americans too in case we go
and then when i start thinking a bit and no no they're not the not northamericans no is the politic of the government yeah right what they do
they decide do then you like you reflect it against you people and you country
but isn't like that is the state and the politic of of the government
sure
sure sure yes no and you have one has its right precisely because you are in a democracy you have the right to protest
i oh exactly exactly not me i hope that this it it
does not affect nothing the ehm the project ehm linguistic but well at least it is a very controversial topic when i heard
hi my name is marisa from philadelphia
the the united states thing is
yes
mhm
it´s very ug
no
ah yes
t v for all oh
oh
hmm
hmm
hmm
i think so on tv yes after what happened after the summit of the americas and all that happened there
hi good evening
yes yes they play it here in in philadelphia a ca there are several hispanic channels the usuals well telemundo univision
galavision and all that
and you hear everything yes and
it is not that and also here here everything is controlled by the government i mean let's say
eh only we hear what what they want us to hear
mmh
mm
yes
mm
yes
hey that's true it's three hours earlier yes
uhm
yes sure
sure
yes that or not the fact in reality as the question may say the world police they make themselves the
leaders of all and and they tell you what will happen and if you don't agree by force you you you have to agree
uhm that's right
with embargoes with all and whatsoever by force with violence ah with war
this
mm
there is still much left and that is what gives me more
very difficult yes
rage because its so clear tell me if you know two plus two is four and you can see how the people are being manipulated
and you try to tell the other person look it's like this like this don't you realize and then they tell you no because you are
liberal or communist that is they
you get labeled and
bad bad you are this you're a terrorist or anti get out of here we don't want you if you don't like
and i say but ah this country is not bad it is the leaders that are bad
yes
mhm
yeah
mm
hmm
yes
no but him to in spain is almost same thing what happens is different the leftwing government but if it was a rightwing government they could have another mentality
the people when they do not agree they fill the streets manifest themselves and leave those here because you never see it i never saw it
oh mhm
yes
yes
yes philadelphia yes
mm
yes
power yes

i well i with my husband here no we moved about a a year ago before we lived in florida and ah
over here looking for work we have we have just moved and
we are in the process of mh well i would like it more what happened is that it was the the the issue with work is better here on the north on the south it is very saturated
and what are we going to do that is work is the main thing

is ruining the world they want to have it all and
they think that you know they think they are you know the owners of all

aha
right
mhm
yes i don't like that i'm spanish and american i was here for necessity looks like pleasure but to me it
ehm and i have to put up with and i have to put up with what the the government does but i don't know either i don't like it it is a
of course well but theory practice don't say anything or but
mm is is like a regimen yes
very
some well something similar happens to me i don't have a lot of positive things to say about the us because i uhmm i'm not a leftwinger anyway then
i
i say i am going to talk to bush because you see that i have so much so much anger that i have to talk to bush and put him in a bad spot because
yes yes yes
what is what
hmm
no outrageous things and then and and their everybody puts their hands on their their heads oh my god this can not be i don't know what
and no they forget about the topic the following week
the news on the television they will say anything to distract the people to get them to forget
mhm
mhm
mercedes speking
um
did you ever have a difficult break up
yes
it's always difficult
um
um
how good
that means that you have only had two boyfriends
that´s good it´s betterwhat for trouble to get in trouble
when there is not need
from honduras
well let me see ah yes me too but not long ago i don´t go through that but i don´t think that i had a difficult experience any time lets see i think that
with a boy i was with ah yes with the first boyfriend i had we were together for about two years
hmm i remember that we just decided that it was over i don´t remember the exact reason of our breaking
but is this one ten years ago
i was nineteen eighteen
yes
and then we well we stopped seeing each other later that wasn't too hard because we were apart i mean he lived in one place and i lived in another
later with another guy with whom i went out with we also went out for a few months he also didn't live where i where
were in the university where we were and he returned to his country of origin
and that was also easy for the fact that you stop seeing him and i mean is easy really
mhm
in that way
eh what else let's see which other one after that i didn't have any other formal boyfriend until s yes the truth is i never had any bad experiences i don't know really thank god
mm
mm
yes
i know
yes
mhm
thank god
but you said before that nothing is perfect that's true always and besides that
ah where from
there's people that makes mistakes and thinks that ah marriage is about according to the times and all nice
but you live with people night and day and people i mean
it's impossible to have a perfect relationship right a situation in which
yes one loves the person but it's impossible to be at peace all the time that's what i mean right
because one then i i am one is a human being and one has to things that bother to other people right and
see to any other people since i'm not saying to the person with who one is particularly but any other person then i know
eventually then we have a day no is not coin for everybody all day twenty four hours a day for the rest of the life then
yes
um
and try
ah that's great
yes yes
um
yes
ah no yes that pey lo what it is eh ironic is that eh those are the usuals sometime those are the hardest relationships
for that for the persons that are enwrappend in this type of relationship
because usually well eh the people now when they are in this type of situation is like their autoconfidence is very low
and then they think that the people think that not that is the best that one time it will let eh what i can reach
i have to take it i have to keep on taking it well
and then eh for real it is not easy like we think that ah he did this i will send him through a tube no
is hard more so because uh it becomes like no is like what not to say addict but at that type of situation of what
and where are you from
the drama is aleh lots really and then the people don't know how to get out the cycle of of abuse is what happens
yes but
mhm
ah
mhm
ah
oh no
ah where from the capital city
and what do you think aboout today's topic is it easier to break with someone young or the age makes a difference
aha
well my name is ibet and you are
i feel that it is difficult when you really love the other person when you don't really love is like anything else okay it is fine let's finish ok
parting ways
then i think when you really love the other person but in this case i imagine it's because you did not get along with the person
or because really i don't know maybe they did not want get along between between the two of them i think that must be it more than anything
and a communication between the relationship
i mean between in the relationship if there is not one one of the parts starts to not tru there is going to be untrust and starts
to deteriorate the communication then i think that could be the reason of the break up but if i know i feel it hurts
um then eh really yes yes yes because for example before i married my husband eh i was with a person and for example eh
the same not for a long time but the fir eh the first my first boyfriend
then this
hello mercedes how are you where are you from mercedes
did not last long with him not a long time but the first ilusion i had i don't know and i was that have told well and i said not becasuse with him i'll get married
eh i'm going to have 3 kids and building castles in the air and when he came once and told me you know what here we are over
what
i think there was he had more experience to say here is the end than i was able to uh i think for him um
it was not that difficult but for me it was
and then now yes everything was for good because i met to whom now is my husband and wow is much better
the truth
then i don´t know
that is and
and you
oh from honduras
yes and how does that happened to you
aha
aha
aha
wow
are you married now
oh
aha aha
aha
aha
wow i have a sisterinlaw who is also from honduras
yes
yes
aha no yes is that sometimes i don't know well for example i think that in in my case eh with the first person i think i grew too fond of him
well it was a lot
more than how he felt towards me i think and it wasn't that long i think it was like two or three months
but all the same i was like in the clouds because they use to say ah this is my first boyfriend and i would probably get married to him and stuff like that
and him and i don't think he thought like that he would say her i don't know if i was his third fourth fifth i don't know
he said yes well i won't marry her i will date her and i will get to meet her and that's all but i think i was the one that had a lot of hope on that
yes that hurts really
yes it hurts because i think that you are all excited and have lots of faith in this relationship and when someone comes and rejects you well you
ay no no i don't know but i know that she is also from honduras
i think that it must hurt a lot more when you are already living with that person like in a marriage
i think that must be one of the worse i think experiences yes i hope i hope i never have to go through that cause we don't know right
so i hope that i never so far i've been married for three years and everything is going on well but it's all so
lots of communication and things like that
yes
no
yes
no yes
yes
yes
yes it is
that's it
yes the truth i fe i think it has to be some truth eh it's difficult eh keep all happy right but
and i think that also and i think eh when you take your relationship for example you know and according you get to know the person
that of course you don't fully know right until you get married with that person but i think that i think
if you see that you don't gel along with the person for example i've met persons eh that hit their partners being partners they hit it and abuse them and force them to their will and then
i think that those relationships will never get to a good place because if they are not married yet
and they treat them that way imagine how it's going to be when they are married not so much they are going to say you are my owner and that
the way they already treat them i think that that one those relationships eh i don't think they are going to work ever i don't know or he changers or
or changes or the relationship is over i think that a relationship that way then i think is not going to hurt at all the opposite
you have to rest if you have a boyfriend that hits you or that
i am from mexico
you are going to rest you will say ay good that finished don't know and i believe that if for example everything starts to go good and all
everything is wonderful and all of a sudden someone don't know they need to go for example to another country or would have to go to another school i believe that there it would hurt a little
because everything is fine but only for third circumstances well they need to seperate then i believe in this type of relations well yes yes it hurts but if it's relation then is
that they hit you abd things like that well no
that yes
yeah
yes
that yes
that yes yes yes it's true you are right because
for example me at one time while i was in mexico i met a girl that eh one time she came with black glasses to her trato work
from the city mexico city yes and
and i told her now your wearing glasses and she had a black eye because her boyfriend hit her
and i told her you know i think you shouldn't let yourself get touched by
your boyfriend because and she said it was to hard to finish their relationship and i asked why and she said
even though things happen i love him
and then i said wow what how can you love a person that hits you she sometimes came with bruises or sometimes
he smacked her things like that
like you said sometimes those kind of relationships are the hardest ones and when she finally did it she cried and cried everyday
she cried during break and stuff like that because she missed and stuff so i think that yeah sometimes um
some relationships i think that for her was very hurtful
mm look well i already went through that stage and i am married but for example ah mm i don't know the experience that i had was very difficult
fabiola
yes i know some people from maracaibo
ehm yes yes
look and you are you arepa
yes
i kn yes a girl from venezuela and in houston
no no no no no in houston in i
texas no no no i work at home in my home
do you work
oh
what a great jobo
fine and you
yes but eh it gives you satisfaction to p have
to be able to help people
there i learned the alphabet in in ah
i learn yes yes
but in signs
oh here my daughter taught me the alph the alph eh some words
not all of them some like i love you and things
yes little words
but nice
and ho to speak
in washington
without listening but they talk they do
ah
that's beautiful
what a difficult taks for the parents
what do you think about about the subject they gave us of the
yes of course i think suddenly more than the love and all that because love maybe is
you get it with time
and and trying so then i think you want to maintain a family you have to want to maintain a family because there's lots of people that love
and they are all so young that the first chance they've got of an opportunity is to fight to separate
they don't work hard they love each other and they love maybe more than a couple that have been together for more than thirty years
and you
but they fight day to day and pass their problems they don't care about problems
and that's what i think they need people from today they need to have patience
and think that they decided to stay with that partner or to marry that couple
i mean its forever even though there are problems you don't run out for every problem you find
and me twelve
yeah
so do i
it would have not matter at all but
as i say if i fall down i just put myself up what's the problem
but now i think before like three times about it
oh
of course i do the same
oh my god
he have not touch me he have not get there
it was pride
it is of no use
it only affects
syrupy is like ready to throw in the towel
sure
yes
hmm no it's a girl and sometimes they treat each other super nice but they don't love each other
opposite directions
they they spend their whole life together
right you just respect and
and what they want to make is the family and that is
right and there's some that say that love yes theres no love no nothing
because of course nobody is making you you want to be there and to support yourself
you can have a partner its hard and when you do you have to
that hardest part after is maintaining it
but no there comes a time that you know that but the important thing is that you can go out with her
and that the system could bring you something
no he is from here
chile
so easy i say
pa and eh well for some things easier
for certain
yes i think that for me it's easier because sometimes the they're very entertaining because i don't understand what he says of he says it touch then it's not right not r no no point for fighting
very with him because it makes me laugh
what do you say or when we're super b
chilean from chile
from maracaibo
carolina
no why do you know people there
oh i see i see well you know that they have a stronger accent no it's like look and you mm
aha
a yes yes yes and how great how great because sometimes it is so difficult to find venezuelans and and they say no no we really know very few venezuelans this and that and me oh my god
we are few of us around here really but like in about a mm it was mm about ten years maybe i think that they have mm increased
hmm
hmm oh do you work at the hilton
oh i heard you at the hilton oh my god oh okay okay
okay okay perfect
yes i work with deaf children
what's up fabiola how are you
aha well o now to tell you the truth i am working with the parents of deaf children hmm
hey yes rather hard
yes
exactly exactly and i did th the same in venezuela only that eh i did it with sign language
ah ok ok chilean of course no
mhm
mhm right but here it's oral
ok
mhm
mm ok
nice where are you
yes yes yes now i'm it's important orally no i'm like in the mid at the other extreme of the of of mm of the mm
of the profession because this is a here they encourage children to speak
um
yes no yes because they um with auditive auxiliaries the can get to listen
then what's done is to try to train then auditively so they can recognize the sounds
um um yes yes tha's like a a possibility they have thus be able to talk they'll never be able to talk perfectly he you you'll feel the difference talking
but definetively they'll have that option then and even eh there are paretns that combine the signal language with the oral part no depending on
the degree of auditive lost of the the the child if it's too profound where there are no possibilities not even with the best surgery then there
eh the signla language is used as a complement
um it a hard taks truly it's really really hard but is good eh gratifying then at the end eh it has a reward though of course they really have to as we say they have to  turn on the batteries
oh my god really far
because otherwise um well hardly then they'll get it then
well look at it it's a hot subject hot hot truly i think that couple's relationships are not easy at all you have to work with a person that
that it's different to yo that comes from another world another culture another way of being and then try to have a common project like
eh sometimes is a little bit difficult no but i think love is the only thing that can make overcome these barriers nothing else
only if there is if there is love and a lot of disposition from the couple those differences and thoes um those eh difficulties that can be found at a certain moment
are overcome what do you think
mhm
of course
mhm
correct
i'm in los angeles
of course
correct
yeah
of course
of course well look that me and my husband are going to be together for about eight years now
and twelve imagine that i mean we've had critical moments but never enough to separate and there's a time where maturity plays a big role right
i in other moment of my life had left
yes
it would have not matter at all but nothing at all
exactly
yes
so now i really think and said he has other things i try to focus in the good things he has i say that he is different he can't think like i do i should not be mad if he doesn't
but i can't let this affect me
exactly the luckily well the first time was horrible i thought it was the end of the world and well there we stood and we weren't treating each other fine until one day i said well what's going on
we had like three weeks we never spend mor that three weeks without seeing each other without speaking or sleeping in the same bed
horrible really horrible i said look you know what i think
hey terrible really immature for our side i told him you know what i think this is really immature
we don't have i mean this is not making sense if you want to continue this project we continue it if not we don't i love you
i love oy but we can't continue this thing you are following one path and i'm moving to another one and really believe that i loved you and it's because that i love you
that i need us to define this because this is madness living in this way even more god will not bless a home like this so
let's get down to work because independently of how grave a situation might be that luckily it wasn't a serious situation but uh it was like neither of us wanted to budge an inch
in the complete opposite oh well where are you from
silly pride because that
totally just the opposite
exactly then well luckily we got back in track and after that we had another and however this one was smaller i think the first one was the one that really marked us
and it was like i mean i was like we say here syrupy i said to myself this is it
yes ready to throw in the towel i said no no no no i won't co i won't allow that i tell him i won't allow that i mean you're wrong
if i have learned something in this life is to look for solutions for things that can be solved
because what will we do with a mediocre relationship i don't want a mediocre relationship as you say there are some people who spend up to 30 years together and in a crappy relationship
they they mistreat each other like you piece of who knows what like what's that why would i want
exactly that too
yes ye yes look a thousand things can happen really so many things can happen to a couple it's it's a really interesting subject because as you say
where
there really are people that they get along great but they don't love each other it's like well i got used to living with him
exactly
exactly there's some that some that definitely do what they want and maintain an image
theres no nothing nothing its true they have to speak something ture about love that's why i tell you i feel like my relationship what it was was love
because the truth is with a difficult situation going on if there was no such thing as love nothing would have finished because there wouldn't be no sense
there wouldn't be sense in something like love so then i feel a lot a lot of love and a lot of compromise of what you're talking about
being there because you want too because its worth it
exactly exactly
exactly
that's the hardest part yes sir and looking how to be continually there and have that harmony like something new something different and not fall into the same routine
oh chilean okay i'm from venezuela
uh
exactly of course noticing it
of course of course is your husband from chile
oh you can guess like uh it's a little more i mean it's not like it's harder really i feel that love can overcome everything
you think it's easier
oh ok ok because my husband is from venezuela and
and sometimes i say i say that that that doesn't have anything to do with the with the nationality i believe that these are universal things
and what what's what you said
bad
how fun
and how did you end up in idaho
oh of course an idaho
well my mom married a gringo
yes and so that's why we came to we went to seattle in ninety one i was about eleven years old
but my dad stayed in chile and that's why i came and go like this
sure
and to
interesting
yes something like that i am like we live together
well then sure
yes well more or less in the example i'm there the whole two thousand and three
yes because i'm inside the city and i like the city more perhaps because i'm from the city or the country for example i was living in san rafael i don't know if you where that's at but
on they way from san felipe to the andes that is like a question more more rural and you couldn't imagine how
typical chilean countryside and i loved it
it was a village what do i know i like to be inside the city because i know there's more going on like you know there are more things to do
more i don't know more what i carry is
so then
yes
but
yes i imagine
of course
and his name and then came and went clear but more or less in the ninetyone and you
of course
yes i can imagine
same in contact is difficult also
ah its not much for nothing for nothing
and from santiago surely
of course
oh i lived here
of course there in santiago and conception
of course
yes just sounds good
hi
because no not that i signed up on monday to do
and i didn't get more from there
hello
oh i wish this wasn't a broken phone but it is only broken sometimes
i was saying what i have been taking calls
well i started at once i was called four times but i only could get one of these calls
yes
well
yes of course
i say to you this has been
hi hi how are you
fun they give a topic to
no ah yes that most be it
i though i was thinking that it was like this this this study to create a like what do you call it phone menus and things like that
for hospitals and theaters and things like that and then they wanted people to speak about things relating to health and things like that for example
ah why union shouldn't be or why one doesn't want to do it
ah
ah sure ah yes
ah yes i thought it was part of the study that they wanted to hear words in spanish or from castillian what do i know
no but no
sure with
oh from idaho very good i'm alicia from atlanta
sure it's the fruit
yes
no no idaho's good for sure
yes i was in washington near seattle when i first came to the united states right
and yea now i'm in georgia i'm in the south so yea like where i'm at now the the everyone's really here and and what do i know the gangs and i'm here in atlanta and
go on get out and it's more set here
eh but yea idaho for example as a state it's pretty rural right
yes i'd think it doesn't really matter where
ah yea i'd think so oh but here in atlanta and it's a pretty big city supposedly the nightlife should be great but really it's
been two or three years
yes
uh well so and all of the businesses and all of the bars and all the clubs have to close at two in the morning just think
at two in the morning everything's closed
it is the reason the industry has that well as everything in atlanta and called bucks head
and how and coo and two three years ago and thing had its crimes and three people were killed was killed three people
there then the city's new mayor over to me so if you good people is killing
but just as it is but it is as if such a city must have at oblation
ah is not much car too self yes
good news is that
clear is not that how bad is that they prefer such a system have a thousand times as good by a straightforward explanation of the problem of
face and further that
fine and you
much congestion
then of course is like a horrible traffic or anywhere delay as each other as
yeas the car
oh yes like over there
sure
oh
it is like that
of course of course it is in or
oh i see i see
i see
that's great and where are you originally
hmm
sure
oh how nice it is the same as sure ehm and it gave a thing over there like this one what the university of washington
we were latin and
yes already
mm
ah
oh right like
right yes
right the wheat
right me too
no
right then what i like is that they think that i am like a palestine or an aquatic thing yes if a go to some restaurants
or if i want middle east food they say
and they tried to speak to me in arab i don't know they found my face to be more indian or something but of course is there discrimination there or no
oh but
ah of course
ah of course
and of course of course
yes yes of course
good here it is like super today that atlanta and all of the south is like sixty percent black like that
yes
then it is like now that it is more diverse it is more like that eh acceptable to my knowledge but at the same time in the south there is the south of the
the united states has a history with being one of the most racist place in all of the united states in fact here
there was slavery and all that then it's the same there where a certain minority of whites hated whichever ethnic group and they had their rare demonstrations and all of those things but
of course
yes but
of course for example in the rural areas of georgia you would see things like you see the ku klux klan i don't know
yes still
and those weird things but is very very far from the city i mean
inside the city of atlanta you are in a more civilized place so those things don't
yes luckily look what has happened
hi
and how long have you been living here
oh okay
mm okay
okay
and so you're single now
oh okay
okay ah look and what's this called do you like it or not
oh
yes
oh
oh okay
oh ok
is not like
is not like instead like very drastic for me to coming here
because i was used to be living in the city not and here but there is a city nearby i can find everything that i need but life is more
is more peaceful to say it like that
more calm and everything same is not good because is for example the eh there is not so much crime like in the big cities
but is kind of borring
half
here yes same but not so much not so much like when even at least less mall is not too big
i'm living here since two thousand two
not so long ago recently
yes from santiago
and you where you from
from santiago too
oh ok
look what what small world
and some time you are in this call by phone
halo
oh yes
hello
oh okay
oh okay
oh are you already calling everyday
oh okay
i also was called this week but i was's able to take the calls because
this has been a lousy week
yes
yes
fin i'm viola from idaho
to talk about to have something to talk about i think
yes i think so
eh
no what happens is that they told me that they gave you topics because like that one is supposed to speak about personal issues
because one shouldn't shouldn't like very personal things
because you never know the other person that's on the phone because
so that's why they give you topics to have something to talk about
oh ok
yes the only thing that they told me is that we had to talk about topics like topics like with no importance but
to have like a topic not to talk with dirty minds
from atlanta
well yes
yea yes and do you like it here
eh
eh
eh
yes it's country and it's all quite country
yes it's like pretty it's like pretty it's like i don't know it's like the nightlife i don't know
eh
wow at two
oh and but why
oh how are you
eh
oh
oh
yes well and as but roamed beyond people use as car or more action
us as well because ah out two in the morning is not so
if you car or something
yes
oh ok
yes
here it is totally different
fine fine
well there are a lo of cars people have have cars everybody because it is a necessity something like that
because there are no trains but
they are like it doesn't it doesn't take that long like to go so many places the where the city where i live i is like half of purt santiago but there is a lot less people because
because you knew here things are like the house are bigger are farther apart things like that
and i am not in idaho falls
in idaho falls
in i am going to a larger city then
there in a larger city but
where we are not it is the country
ah
from chile
no here you have arto like cars and all that
you have mexican arto and how it is more than anything a rural place
they hire some mexican people like me to do the job in
on earth and stuff like that
then almost always all you see is mexican people even they see and the people takes you for a mexican
less latin they say ay mexican
the you have to go saying that no no no
i'm not mexican
yes
eh
really
uh uh yes the same the same but no
o well yeah everywhere
same more than anything it's about how latino people are but they do not know how to speak but
because the same there is a lot of people who are the same that go shopping and do not know anything
english and then they have to go around but not like other people you know how in every place they are average
because over there they are very discriminatory you know that
oh okay
oh
ah well things that were strong yes
they fight hard
oh how good
here no is nothing like massive is a little like kind of unpleasant but not like groups not things like that
oh yes really
oh mm
eh
eh
oh oh how weird
oh i married a gringo
yes i married a gringo that's how i came here and you how how
oh really
mm
well oh hi juan marcela
yes
mm
ah
and didn't they give you eh the attention
mm
yes but it can be cheaper
yes that helps what a thing
yes no i think that the whole system will have to collapse before they do things differently because i think that it's already too difficult to fix it because there are
the costs of the cost of everything depends on demand and so if those costs keep on going up up and up
because there is more demand and because people pay for it and so the costs keep on going up because people ask for more money and the people that work ask for more money it's a vicious circle and so how can you all of a sudden create a social medicine
yeah how're you doing
it is impossible because all these people are already like
the money doesn't stop being like a drug you see they are already used to a certain amount of money
and then now suddenly they are not going to have it
yes of course yes
we would stop making bombs and going to war look all that money that could be put
on schools or in a medical system social medicine
mm yes
yes well nurses get paid very well because there are a few nurses you know there are fewer
mm
yes tell me twenty thirty dollars an hour
yeah i think so you're in texas and i'm in north carolina
um
no but the difference is that they started right
yeah it's like in argentina my parents have their full medications paid
all their medicines are paid they pay a little right but very little
yeah
it's it's very expensive
in other places around the world everywhere around the world
yeah there was this medication i was taking my son took it for a shor while and it turns out that here there was no medicine you see without the brand
uh and then uh we went to argentina last year i went to the drugstore and i showed them something that was over fifty dollars here
i bought it there for twelve dollars
oh yeah me too
twelve dollars the same brand and all
and it could have been it could have been less if he bought the other brand the unknown brand one thing
but didn't understand
mm
mm
yes yes yes
truly yes truly yes
well what do i know apparently that things yes like that
supposedly what specialty do they have to operate here do you know what you'd have to do
why don't you put yourself in contact with an organization that is called shriners
right
shriners yes
ehm because they help the children
now i don't know if they specialize in a specific disease or if they cover everything because maybe
you can communicate with them and tell them hey we have this child and this is his condition and this is our situation
and maybe they can help in some way because shriners dedicate to help to pay for the medical care of children that can not pay
of the parents can not pay
i don't know they say it is of twelve minutes but their twelve minutes seem like half an hour
yes maybe i am making a mistake in not finding out you see it doesn't cost anything
and also if you call the catholic charities
maybe they maybe they have i don't know a wave or something you see that can help you in a
uh i'm covered through my husband
there are lots of samples and but knowing a little bit more about the advances its because i can give out the medicine we think that one diagnostic more profound could improve the lifestyle of my son with
of course
mm and of course he is growing and then possibly he doesn't need this medicine they have to give him another one
mm
what
and you you must live with the heart in the mouth
and that is a lot of stress
a lot of stress
mm yes yes yes
hmm
and the children are covered so we're ok
sure because on top of that he feels embarrassed look how old is he
how old is he
ah sure he's a teenager
yes do you know where you can ask around in the teaching hospitals
with the doctors the medical centers that have medical schools
sometimes the different departments there
they'll see people that that can't pay in a normal situation you know like us who can't go to a specialized doctor because it's too expensive
and we don't have that much money
and they they make notes of what they give you and they charge accordingly something that always is uhmm
reasonable something that you can well pay sometimes they don't charge anything
that's a problem right
of month and that is is this interesting i had to make myself an abscess i it turns out that i have a thing that is called add
and i for years i thought that i had it but in the end i went an like i had been diagnosed i the same and in the end i found here in the teaching hospital of the university of north carolina
and they didn't charge me anything and they did all the exams
yes
ah yes then it is that with the
with the university ah
ah but what a thing
mm
they didn't want to give you that information
ay then maybe you can
um we're very healthy but you never know
mm
maybe now you can
hi how are you my name is juan marcela
people from the community right
and well the papers that they asked me with my address and proof of work and finally they found an excuse to not not giving it to me because they asked me
to give information about the person that was hiring me and at that time well that person didn't want to give the information no
and and in my case i have a son with epilepsy
and then he needed some some emergency attention here things that
eh no no no they didn't want to give me the prescription right so in the cases that press with him he was in a bad way once yes he became worse
and then i had to to return to mexico and there he was treated by his doctor
and they prescribed him and then once i ran out the medicine here eh normally i buy in mexico and
it's a problem the prescription and then a friend who is a doctor had samples and he gave me samples of the medicine
no yes he gave me then yes it's something that we thing about that well there should be some type of more flexible no in order to well in case there is for the community but it's a certain type of community
hey didn't we talk the other day with
yes yes
yes
yes it should be
uh uh
exactly it is a problem it is a circle that works with earnings here they are stronger no
then the interest is wors
mm
mm mm well they will go just a little bit lower
with that because here i don't know there where you are living but here if someone has money it is nurses and doctors no
then mm and well here as they say you see a good car with a woman who is thirty for example no
yeah i i'm really glad
and she is a nurse and that's how it goes when you find out they really are nurses
yes yes i uh uh then who in this case well it is offered in canada i understand well they have much medicine no
then any canadian resident has the right to medical services just for being there and it doesn't have any major real consequences on the economy
and it's um exactly
uh uh
yeah yeah yeah that's the other thing you could at least try to pay something
you're gon na have some kind of insurance but that's it
it's expensive right and then i don't know how the medications are here but well in mexico they're cheaper and its more like that
and there's more competition on the medicines there for each stuff
uh uh
i haven't forgotten you we practiced together right hey but today's heath
yeah yeah yeah
yes
same yes
and the mexican case for example the medicine of my son are in five six marks
with some ingredients
no yes yes and here there is only one and secondly the literature isn't the best and if it is only the laboratories and i think that all the northamerican laboratories well eh
then at the time of the competency well here there is a monopoly
strong interest in all no
mm
but
do you have insurance here are you covered
yes
uh uh ah yes
yes i know yes i know
mm
mm
yes
uh uh uh uh well yes look yes
yes i knew that hey we ran out of time or what
oh look that yes i knew just the and thought that it was for me and me younger without gryas and like that for a style more
mm i am going to crash
uh uh
uh uh uh that is true
yes yes it is very simple because to tell you the truth well on one hand the maintenance is a medicine that this person that helped me with the sample says no man this
here we are gifted no problem only look for a community center or something
there are lots of samples and but knowing a little bit more about the advances its because i can give out the medicine we think that one diagnostic more profound could improve the lifestyle of my son with
with the epilepsy right
because it had been under control but lately he has as close to two years that it has been disconnected he has been out of control
and well yes they gave him another one they leveraged him and it didn't work so by no means he had to take it off and return to the basics
yes yes he got worse
yes yes you know it is matter of experimenting
well yes sometimes yes
oh well look we're we're not
all the time yes
life without you telling me is always pending all the time
right then you know one is always hoping that it doesn't happen well i don't really know what really is going to happen but right it does cause trauma but poor son of mine because he is a teenager so
it happens in school and he feels really bad
yes it's a stigma it's a stigma what he has no then
seventeen
eh yes well returning to the subject i think he should try with some good
system of eh
uh
yes
we're not covered it's a problem because there's always something that could happen right
hmm
hmm yes
mm
uh uh
uh uh
ah yes
as well it is all good to which orientation do we go now because in fact where i went it is called university system healthcare system something like that but
then just like that there is where they bounced me
i told them
mm uh uh then they told me no well you have to bring us information i had a letter about my income etc no
and the yeah and the other day i went precisely to a an office in which they supposedly give some kind of i mean pension for
but not that we need your employer's social security and then there was where they didn't want anymore
no wel not i but well then now i have my social security myself
yes employed
i go anyway
uh uh
hello how are you my name is juan
well more than than sometimes let's say that it belongs to the institution in which you are no it is more a work tool
but a tool like very personal seems to be the car no
yes yes exactly besides like i am here in texas
i believe that here the car culture is something like a reminiscence of the horses culture also
no is like a horse it is something like very very very personal very closed
to to your life here take care of them and the is as important as let't say as the horse at that time no
some years ago and and well well if don't say so in our time of communication the most important devices are going to be the related with communication the computer
eh everything that allows the handling of the information and everything right
but
yes
i am in san antonio mateo i think we had already talked you are in philadelphia
exactly and here working people have like in that times like a mule no they need a a a pick up a truck pick up
pick up truck right and listen and it does not leave them then is eh it is evident like it is a hard work culture very very important
and the computers well in every home there's television telephone and computers basically isn't it but but like there are other dimensions of the technological cuestion then the automobile seems to be
of the most most important
ah what a what technical technological question is more important in your life that's what we're discussing right now if it should be the automobile or the computer what do you think
aham exactly
aham
aham
yes yes
having your cellphone
ah look it is nice to talk with you again
yes notice that it is it's verry important what you just said some time ago when i was working i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important thing was it
and well on the computer were the messages there was always the internet the mails more than the phone the cellphone anything right
the computer was the most important
but now with the type of work that i am doing the car is the most important the computer because the car is what permits retype of job that i am doing
more phisical no then the car becomes the most important tool and the computer well in a second plan even though it is also very important no
well it is because the type of work well
yes yes
yes yes that yes
ah yes
yes eh yes because of the distance i have to travel in my work the car is more fundamental
listen well all good this what do you think about today's topic
but yes and in the city i believe the most imortant and depending on your work also well eh could be the computer no then
the the other question o o the tools of communication no like you say the cellular
and that and eh and the uestion is if you consider that you are eh this technology becomes more a problem then then in
well what kind of problems could he have right like you said with the car the problems that have to do with the parking
no here in texas no there isn't where i'm from there is not major problems no with the parking there is a lot of space everywhere he hasn't presented
lets say those problems here but in the end i don't know i don't know what your opinion is above everything i would say that well in regards with the cars matter of cars and all that well it doesn't look like a big problem unless
we could consider a problem the interests created around the motor industry and like so sometimes they affect the growing of technology
of transport right for example
yes
yes yes yes but yes
the topic are technical gadgets i mean technology the gadgets you use the most and that you depend on then and if how do you consider that dependence
well
yes
exactly yes well like they say too with the motor industry right if the motor industry would have advanced technologically much like the electronic industry then maybe an automobile will let us transport like
one hundred kilometers with one liter of gas
right and instead of costing like twenty thousand dollars it would only cost ten thousand dollars
if that was the case no but like the technology in this case the industry has their interests well no like it does not advance no you can see already what they are saying now about the hybrids
that no most of them say that they are not feasible and that in reality it is only a matter of image that the companies manage and when the time comes to see the the scoreboard
regarding hybrid automobiles well i thought that they were going to be much more efficient i think that the efficiency they have achieved is minimal
no no i don't think that they have a real a real ehm that it is really a change like that very importanttechnological given the efficiency that
pardon
and how do you consider the matter of technology no your daily life if it becomes more of a problem than a solution or something like that
no i don't think that it is that important at the same time that the efficiency they have proven is not radically different to the ones others have it is very little no you see i say
a a according to the rules an economy car drives you it could be thirtysix miles per gallon
and a hybrid can drive you fifty
oh so
ok
yes exactly but at the same time cars like this there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance that hybrids and they aren't hybrids no
by small cars news that are not in the north american market they are in the european market or latino american where they have to be more efficient
and smaller no then if we compare with the spend of a hybrid against a small europe car or those that run in latinoamerica so
it goes out more expensive have a car for the initial spend and for what you can save in gasoline finally
its less that you have a car very low cost no
it is the same that it is the same i was thinking clearly they should include it no
european
yes i am yes
yes i just a few years ago the oil problem in the eighties or something like that i don't remember
i thought i was having an exchange of culture because they started to develope little more here in the united states
i thought well i was going to have an exchange of culture but that was nothing by the time no it seems because they have a big cars they keep like
exactly well but i said well yes the automobile seems to be the most important no it is then i thought maybe it is the computer but no
aha exactly but sometimes eh what seems like a more personal element depending on the case well it can be the car no because the computer is more and more another tool
hello well eh mateo here
because you have to be careful with the car and you know
okay
did you use horses more
yes
yes
yes because here in texas yes but even there in texas
you need the car you know to to work
so
really yes yes
right
yes yes yes and you are
yes but the cuestions on the topic were what
well for mi it would be more my computer and my cell phone
because you know because i have my cell phone and i'm always with it
and well i've grown accustomed to having a cellphone you know
back then i didn't had a cell phone until i was like twenty but now that a that i live in philadelphia in the city and that i'm not always going back home fo
not always going back home for for you know seeing my messages
well i'm always always always having my cellphone
i think it's very it's like surprising that almost everyone has a cellphone here in the united states
yes
yes
yes how how have you been
but now
well for me i believe that well you and you where around texas and obiously you know that there is more how you say i understand that there is more buildings and stuff around there you know
lot more space
for in the in the city having a car can be an inconvenience as well
because you have to try and park and have to pay to park and the gas station is not close and i don't know es
is more of a problem then a help because a help but obviously you know obviously
better to have a car i think
yeah sure
yeah
right
no i didn't hear it what is the topic
right but don't you think that that its very awesome that it changed in about sixty years
a yes we seen how sixtyfive years ago there wasn't any cars but nowadays everyone has it
and the same thing with computers they have they have computers that wont go off the market for like ten years because
because they have those things very advanced and the things have not cumbri have not cum
charged their development costs you understand me i can't explain it very well but
right
yes
yes
yes that was an important change
you don't think that it is an important change or
this includes automobiles cars
oh
aha
oh no ehm yes sure sure that there are cares around right now like the the fords
the pick up trucks are good they are changing to be more efficient you know
but the expedition those cars are big so they are expensive you know only they can go twenty miles ten and eight miles per galon or something like that that's a huge expense
oh yes
and why is that
because the united states is one of the ony nations that have this you only have big cars here you know
there in other countries have smaller cars its good a different culture you know but
ok
yes because it is a you know a machine
yes but
yes the most obvious one is the computer well but it is not the only
ah
yes and because of that the same thing you buy a car and you are always using it and you always have to maintain it you always have it is some part of your life
oh faviola hi
then oh i find that it is good the classification they have i believe that is the adults responsibility until when the children can watch television
the are doing their job the one who make movie and
in their business you
yes now the one who wants it take it who wants to see it do not want to see it is not their responsibility they see
that sells
and is what they do it is not their fault is the fault of the ones who buy
yes
yes
yes
exactly
how are you
mm i think i totally agree and the other normally the children have access to television whenever parents are not home
children are alone
and there isn't a father there to show or teach you can't view this view that
right no you don't have a clue
exactly
right
no and besides
yes and when they reach a certain age my son had around 15 years and he tells me don't worry you've the best you could
ah 25 is the genes and education and the rest decision my life decisions
sure then i learned oh wait no eh oh i was and
very nice sunny or cold
my cell phone was ringing ok ok wait and i'll answer
eh don't hang up because we need to talk for twelve minutes
it i only went to turn it off
and about the people i think on the movies i love to watch horror films
but sometimes that that i'm scared i'm a adult
i get scared and i'm going to find out about horror movies
yes
yes that's why that's why i respect what my son told me that time fifty per cent is responsibility
of of the individual of the person eh you already did the best you could but it comes an age in boys before they are eighteen
some are more mature than others
cold
and they start watching rated r movies
at the age of fourteen and fifteen and eleven and twelve year olds are watching pg 13 movies
and sometimes even kids and even younger kids because i remember my friend jenny had a kid that watched harry potter
pg thirteen pg fourteen so i say jenny doesn't like that she gets scared
she's scared of monsters and all that
but i agree that the major part is the criteria that you make of it to take care of them if they don't want too
not just leave them with the tv
but its only tv
we need to have criteria formed to watch movies
aha in the same school they show them movies
yes
they show them documentaries
follow like superman the little boy that climbed on the window and got killed
that he wanted to fly no i want to ask you a question
eh did you read the rules that are in this phone game
i was asking myself ah how is this are you getting ready for christmas yet
is your birthday no
that's what i was going to tell you
cook and boil to boil that thing you made that thing you gave me
not that the table thing
oh because they are
i did not had that topic before and i had to talk about it specifically the person i had to talk to talked about violence
that's pretty
andreita has her birthday too oh three
oh yes but i remember it was like three days
what did you buy miranda
ah how nice
ah how nice
i'm excited
and you know who else has a birthday coming
on the same date
that i remember from when i was there
no he liked the idea of going to see movies i told him the world is the world it has violence
your father in law yes
him him juan luis sandra's youngest son
also on the twenty the twenty ninth i also remember that more or less around the same date i remember that they were all around the same date
no you went to little carlos' birthday and the one for teh girl
no you did go once you went to chile and you left a present that was for the birthday
ok that was another birthday she has three
yes for a nephew of hers who came later
no but sandra will not celebrate her birthday she won't have a party that year
no she said no just for the family because they're going to buy something better for the kid
and really she makes parties that are too big
always had and have the experience to teach children abroad peace and love on television oh oh in the world and later when they face the real world which is the school
too much she spends too much on that and they can't buy what they really want for the kid
they of course they have to decide between one or the other so yes this year the kid decided he wants just the family
sure so he can have one more present
the youngest of all
and and he says i don't want any clothes
i don't want books only toys
you find that little kids hit him that they do not know how to defend themselves moreover when you have only children
i am ana maria
i agree the maximum responsibility lies within the parents
they are earning money what is your job
doing their business yes
of yes
yes
yes the one who likes the product for that reason
with you that is the most responsibility whether is in violence of sex of what ever you want to protect a a child in the responsibility is of the parents even if there is a classification
because if there is a movie classification for example pg thirteen
if you have younger child and if you let him/her watch the movie is your responsibility
is because you let him/her and you thought it could be is that right
hi faviola
so then because i the the association or or or whoever places places the classification already have it then
i think if imagine we think more or less the same in that faviola because at the end you realize that the responsibility or raising and take care and of what you want them to see and not see
your children or your family eh your mother or your husband like mother
exactly
mhm
and if they make a sleepover you don't know either
if they go a sleepover and they put a movie watch it in that house without control and whatever
you never know
i think the important is give them one to respect that rules and if you give them good principles at home your family ans show him things
exactly that i don't like or i don't like it you must see if you're prepared the moment will surely come
good and yourself how is the weather like in your house
why because like they say you can't have them in a crystal box
yeah exposed boy or exposed girl
mhm
look with that
mm
ok
yes
ok ah
yeah
you you scare yourself
sunny and cold oh
yes yes but your responsibility is to watch it and you scare yourself
yes i don't like them and i don't watch them i don't watch any kind like that that is why it's my decision bec even if i have the age to watch it if it's too aggressive i don't want to watch it
yes
yes
mm
yeah right
yeah thirteen yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah why why
over here weather is ugly it is cold what do you think about the movies have you talked already about this topic
but imagine if you cant control it
that's what i mean you can control it you need to be more mature it isn't true
yeah that's why i said you don't get anything good out of watching it like at his friends house
oh the same school but the same school is a little more supervised because that's already another thing because they have a purpose
but what i fear the most is when they go to their friend's house and they sometimes have the television right there in the room which is so customary nowadays or the computer or whatever
and they have access to information without their parents without their parents having any idea and they are in the room their parents think that they are listening to music or whatever
perhaps they are watching something inappropriate that's why i mean what happens is that if my daughter or son or whatever it is
faces that situation he has to learn to value himself and learn to respond to that that's what i say in other words trying to instill in him the home values
of course because you know they are still not prepared
aha
i also had that topic before
yes okay
yes yes yes i'm getting ready i'm already buying the gifts for the family but now i have i have other things on my mind
yes but i'm already getting ready buying gifts for the family at least my nieces and nephews they're set we've already bought them their gifts so i only have the adults left
buy something for the adults a little something either way i'm going to make the majority of the gifts
i'm going to cook yes ah
yes for some kids too yes
yes the the yes that too but i don't have time yet i have to wait until the middle of to december's last week to do it
because i don't have time before
yes so that's what i'm going to do too that's why some gifts i will make but for example hmm andreita has her birthday soon for example
two days before miranda
mhm
if she was born on the 25th or 24th i can't remember
three days then it's the 24th then i got a little gift for her i bought her the same thing i bought miranda then eh
por te pre one of those screens where you draw and then can erase it
because she likes them she she already knows them and she likes them she draws little lines and then she erases them and i won't give the to her yet because they're very small and she'll put them in her mouth
but meanwhile you'll give her the pencil and the screen
but yes because little things like that
of course you see then those things like that are nice to do so i bought the same thing for little andrea and that was it
yeah who
who
my father in law who
mhm
yes it's true who
oh yes yeah
i don't remember of his of being in i didn't know at least
i haven't gone to any birthday to sandra's house i went to only one but i don't remember to tell you the truth
eh it was in april then when i went to chile it was april
and i left the present yes i left the present right there
of course he came yes yes she told me that she had given it to him later yes but what his name is no
no no okay
yes it's true
she spends too much yes
ok
what they really want exactly
so he can get a more special present
jua juan luis is the eldest or the youngest
ah okay
poor thing
tamara
then what do you think about what they show in the movies
aha
aha
yeah
no no i'm here at my computer sorry
ok
yes because there are many movies like that i have realized
yes i like them a near where i live there used to be one of these ah like a hollywood video or blockbuster but it was like
smaller
back then they had movies like documentaries and things like that but they closed it because the big stores always are around here and people didn't want to go to that
yeah and you
but those are the best ones like you find movies that i really like my husband is american but he likes international movies too movies that have more
more important things to say
every now and then since i've got little kids sometimes there want to go see some movie and we take them but usually no we have some we used to go two or three times a month to the movies
but now it's not there anymore so now like one or two times every two months
uh huh exactly
i'm from panama
oh okay
in then yes it's true it's true
yes it's true what you say here my husband and i we see the news
because whenever you see something or they give something to you well stupid
i'm in seattle washington state
or you have it or they exaggerate to you enough
because when i was we were in panama before noriega left panama
and we were there and my husband you know this white man paper white compared to my father and my mother is white so i left more than my father so
when we left you know that he was american
we both introduced we didn't meet by where we had to go he had to go to work at the base and i had to go with him or something thus
and then out of nowhere we would put on the tv and there would be a little bit of what has been happening in panama i would just look at him
and say hey weren't we there this morning i don't remember seeing that this morning
and the next day i would say the same thing i think they were just showing the thing they showed last week what
it has arrived since then right i don't want to believe what the tv says
none of the news that's what i tell my kids don't believe everything they say on tv
oh yeah
because its not true and that
ha
that's the documentary about the man the took the guys head
no no he doesn't remember
i see
of from chorrillo
yes that's were he was that's were was the police or part of the polce
yes that
yes because like i told you i'm not that into news sometimes but its uncommon
tv
yeah
yes  tv cuatro
right
tv or tvforall
with
ok
ok
aha
yes
hello
no i might have i don't remember
yeah this is i think this is my twenty three call
mhm
some
aha
yeah and this is the second time i make a service with them
yes
yeah i it's
carolina
didn't you you got the same email right i mean that apparently this will continue you see according to what i understood from the email they sent me
it's more like right tell me
say well i will tell you honestly it's been more than a year since we stopped watching movies movies in the regular cinema and we move to the cinema
not so  conventional
we moved to the cinema for example in case of cinema no same as the one on television now we watch movies like documentaries well eh with a different type of message
watch movies that are on on eh what do you call it the festivals there we go for example the recently finished international festival of latinamerican cinema
eh yes it was
hello
ah ok well approximately a month more or less a month because since a long time ago as i tell you we decided that we wouldn't continue wasting our time
time in most cases really movies have a really silly and absurd content ans well we made the decision well not to that we didn't want to waste time or money
tamara how are you uh
eh watching a kind of movies that really don't give you anything
yes
ok
right
exactly exactly
ah ok
okay yea we don't go a lot either like once a month but we used to go a lot more often quite often quite often and one good day we saw a movie really st
upid so dum that i felt bad to be there in the movie theater i well what are we doing here what a waste of time this is
no no no and really all of a sudden we started hearing about other movies and everything that's great we completely left it behind now we're in a
in one of those
fine fine uh where are you
what are you doing right i mean to watch that really i prefer aco lay down and go to sleep or i'd rather do something else instead of of no i'm saying all of the movies there are some that have a
a pretty different message that's worth seeing but lately i've felt like they're making movies like to make them
uh huh like great we have to make ten movies we're going to make ten movies but it doesn't matter what when how it turns out to the
forget about it like we say where are you from
ah okay i'm from venezuela
aha yes
we say thus to  macha no because good if they make films like they want to but yes they leave good ones leave and others if they don't leave don't leave but
honestly no and the same is passing right now with the television we had cable and now he just has a question of we cut it to a month because no i don't know suddenly like
that we put ourselves against what we saw that there was a lot of manipulation of the average ones they only pass the news to you that agrees with them they hide the truth
eh then that is concerning those of the reporters and the films then if that's not one film that's really very good very good
wow i'm in los angeles
but then they repeat and repeat and repeat ay my god what is this we are paying for this then it's like an annoyance right now we have like an annoyance with
with mass media we are thus reluctant yes yes
i think aha
exactly
exactly
ay maginate
logical logical
of course
exactly
exactly
yes it's just incredible
exactly
exactly
look by accident they lent me a movie called'the bad of canada' or'the definition of panama'
this came out when the problem in norway and everything else came up the documentary as well i was shocked because i didn't image it would have been so sad
so bad what happened
oh yeah
look i don't exactly remember it what i remember is that night lots of people died and a few days ago they put on
a meeting for the president over here
he was there and people was protesting why the current president didn't do anything to remember the local victims
i think they were called los de richos chinos that zone practically disappeared the whole town
right now i was making a phone call and suddenly i mean i didn't think today was sunday i was more asleep than awake and i ¡oh my god
yes from chorrillo exactly
but that you are saying it's almost the same un venezuela with the current president there are happening things you don't even know
which happened a long time ago then they put it here in venezuela and i don't know the other day i wrote to one of the journalist
from univision i said to him to sop being so shameless to stop saying things that were not true people always says oh that president
which is crazy what it's really happening is that the press is changing the information so he appears to be a monster a dict
ator well a dictator we have gone through four elections and for referendums i can't be more democratic but it is his personality his personality is
one in a million and people don't accept that it's not a common man and people don't accept it then he is the first criticizing that
oh well i don t know if you listened
of course there is a website where you can watch television from all the countries including panama it's called
tv cuatro like tv four
yeah you caught me off guard but have you been participating long in this
four
four it's a number four
tv number four all
exactly that's exactly where you go
it's dot com yes
there you can watch the programs of all channels of all the world's channels and then of course is panama and venezuela and now i i watch venezuelan tv
but specifically i watch the government's channel there the national channel because the other channels are from the opposition so of course it's a little bit more of the same
but i like to watch it to see what nonsense they're talking about
so i compare them and so if i have a website open i don't turn on the television anymore we are now stuck to the internet watching the channels
from the whole world you compare this is what is happening there ah and that also happens with the radio we listen to public radio radio that you feel is
wow you're almost ready i'm just about half i'm going for the tenth
they are really saying the truth or at least you have a different point of view i mean we don't get the whole truth but sometimes it's not as
biased as the other one i don't know i can't say that what the others say is
false but they do manipulate the information
i don't know if you
did you watch i'm not sure did you watch a movie named  auto fox
it's a documentary about fox news
and well it's about people that used to work there and they said they were forced to lie they quit the channel and they got together and they started to complain
on a local level local to tell the world what's happening there in fox news it's quite interesting it's something like
the workers from fox that are out
something like  out from outside
oh ok ok yeah because i got an email that they're taking back people that are participating again uh because at first you could only participate once
and fox of fox news
hello my name is fernanda
what what clasification
but i think that the majority of television that are lets say if you see during the midday that is when a lot of times the kids are at home
they are things that are not appropriate for the majority
i think that hm the americans are not like the mo standard morals have decreased you understand me then
now lots of things are like normal that that i think it will not be
aha
mhm
right
okay
clearly and
how are you
mhm
ah
how horrible
yes and that could happen to whichever child that was watching tv
and you can not be inside let's say if a kid changes you can't skip or see you have to have faith that let's say at least during the day
the programming does not have any nudity or crudity or nothing like that
yes
in mexico district mhm
i pyes and pilook i am from colombia and i think that in colombia neit
the television is much better than here in that way
from washington
because cacan be let's say ten at night and the series on air never are so you don't take the risk do you to be too poor like here here
moreover here nor at nor at ten nor at any time you are taking the risk to watch anything
oh yes
how horrible
yes
yes imagine when let's say there are there are babysitters and things like that that you have no centro and you are not even home to see
you don't know what they might be watching that they go to their friends or anything like that
i think
yes
mmm
washington dc
of course
yes i
exactly
they don't care
sometimes and
yes yes
of course of course
one really doesn't know how they will change
exactly
and even one gets used to it do you understand me let's say
yes washington state
like sometimes i see it and like you don't realize how much things have changed
and you're from where are you from
yes yes of course
yes i don't know much about the truth of films
lets say i don't have children or nothing like that then almost i notice
my name is
they have pornography sometimes and later it'spg thirteen sometimes it's not is more calm
and does not have as many things as nudity or profanity to be true to those classifications for me it's not like that sometimes
we don't know the people that critique these movies and we don't know the classification o or we don't know what it was from your point of view
aha
aha
aha
aha
yes
yes
yes it is true because hm and is true because hmm one time well i don't have cable dont have the normal channels the ones to see
hello fernanda how are you my name is claudia
but for example i had one one time cable and sometimes was well what you like ten in the morning eleven and well i like to be changing the channel
to be well choosing my program that im going to see in that ra in that time
and sometimes passing movies that really uf if a child of ten years old or nine was in the house and was looking him it was changing also at the same time that i i
i stop in that channel they were things but very already adult
and then i said i said i thought about the kids i said well i am married i have been married three year and i have a son of almost two years
also my son is going to grow and at least this is going to continue for the worst so
imagine for a moment what type of caricatures are going well i remember that one time i was watching tv pay attention in mexico i am the city of mexico
it was 10 at night exactly 10 at night then i turned on well i had cable there so i turned on the cable
the channel here is 16 then i it was a caricature in english because already at night there is something in english something in spanish
and it was a cartoon in english so i left it on and it was my mom well peaceful because she was watching a channel of cartoon
where are you from good how are you speaking
good well the little monkeys began to come out naked
the monkeys began to do things the two little dolls it was a cartoon imagine it was 10 o clock at night my mom said
she turned off the tv and she had to explain a little because my mom it surprised her because i had put on a channel of cartoons a normal channel
then already the truth already no already the cartoons don't survive
sometimes the cartoons yes
yes
yes yes it's true but there are not really the cartoons sorry the japanese cartoons are are those which have more classification eh have in mexico eh
eh surin cablevision and multivision what would be what cable here so oh there in mexico they don't have so many restrictions but for example in ordinary televisions the regular channels
yes they have more more restrictions eh not too much in the other channels and for example in in tvs for example regular of cha children channels
of that kind of television any channel the channels for example that is the five in cartoons
ah which of the two
for example then arrives at ten o'clock at night eleven and you can watch the tv and they don't transmit so unpleasant programs well
before in mexico but for example if you are watching a cable channel you take the risk that the cartoon could be about something sometimes about some
pornographic stuff or more about nudity
then oh okay
right
right
yes yes it's true fi the other well eh i was with a neighbor imagine i was with a neighbor it was at noon half past twelve
then her kid was watching eh the a cartoon channel and then the girl thought to change to tv and em and wa other channel that was also programmed to them to kids
so there was a series where it was where it was a a girl that lived the adventures of a girl and she was in a hospital
and suddenly happened right there of the hospital and they showing like like her mom was having to her little brother
ah b
aha but you could still see it and i got and told her to to her mom and she said oh there is not problem that is a channel of
of of cartoons of of they air programs and to tell you the truth i was i was did not they did not leave much to the imagination it was really like the pose of well ehm it was an operating room where the woman was having her baby
they were they are six years old
because they are twins she iss ehm both of them are six years old and their mom was letting them watch that well each each parent lets them see what they
what they want but honestly to m if i don't want to explain so mch to my children at that time well honestly i like i watch more what the
well what they see no in that aspect but uf
mm aha
yes no
yes it is of those for real those classifications they give and n and n and of the mainly of the television the truth already already n
they already don't leave anything to the mi to the imagination they now show it to you
ah already and the other
now at any at any time of the day you see with one of those soap operas i don't like to watch soap operas but you see
how much __ mom is at home and has her small children of three four years old five or more or they are at home and they see they are watching her soap opera
and always ar they show scenes where they are the the a couple they are there having sex
and during the day because sopa operas are on air from six in the morning until night
and they are like that leaving nothing to imagination
then programs are now rated ans whatching a pornogrpahic scene in tv an any time is normal and for many
parents it's becoming unfortunately normal
and i think that if parents talk to the broadcaster and demand for a more restricted television of this kind of scenes
i think it would be a little better but now parents are fine if the children watch something like that there is not problem
they should teach themselves and then that's why i don't like the classification system producers don't really care about that i think they find helpful classification because
yes i am here in the state of idaho and i don't know if you know it
if a movie has a sex scene or rude language for the buyers well they will laugh
and sometimes it brings attention because it's a really strong scene then those things sometimes help to
producers to sell
then no personally i like movies like i like disney movies or
child movies i like them
even if i'm tired i love them i have some disney movies here and honestly i don't like movies
that are really intense that have a lot of things like like sex and all that because again i tell you i'm going to have more kids and at times i'm not going to be here
and at least if they are going to put on a movie well let it be a decent movie at least that it doesn't have so many things
the way things are going soon even the ones from disney perhaps will have pornography right so
no no the truth is this is going honestly too far you turn on the television and if you you already see a commercial
if this truth because i see lot of that in the movies a lot of truth in my view i don't really quite agree with them
of feminine pads and they appear there and they are going to explain there how and in a while they will put a naked woman and they will
show there how they are putting on the pad
because sometimes they even draw it i don't know if you've seen commercials like that all the same it doesn't scare you because you're already big right but
but if for example a boy or a girl is watching it and you say if the mom is there she can explain it to them in a good way and if a friend is there
and they tell them they can explain it with bad information so
then yes
they are not ranked very well you know eh for example they sometimes say it's pg and then you see it eh that movie and really
good night my name is mariza from philadelphia
in another way the um the christians are the most powerful religion in the world and they're the ones who lets say they're the ones who have the most power to influence the politicians the countries
right
uh yeah
yes
um
really
oh oh no
oh yeah i've heard that yes
exactly yes there are a lot of trouble yes
no everyone can believe in what you want the thing is that they try to impose their beliefs on everybody and the bible what they think
mariza mariza
yeah the rightwing fundamentalists yeah yeah but also the country is uh the party in power is that everyone from the president to the everyone in it is on the white house they're all rightwing conservatives
white uh christians and they're all the people with power on the country the ones with the companies everyone they're the same they're a lot of fundamentalist and rightwing conservative people that want to remove the law
the right to abortion the right to for example like the other question to homosexuality gay marriages the right to believe
yeah more scientific right no you don't have to believe only in what they say they say god created man and woman but also to give children a choice to believe
what was charles darwin theory of evolution and
and is very complicated also of the other question was over the homosexuality yes yes yes we all were the same or believe the same it wont be problems like this he question
but
yes
of course to me i don't have any
mhm
oh uh maybe yes
yes im convinced of that is because i know a lot of people that are
hm so homosexuals or lesbians and im very informed and then for that always i don't know why from what im from when i was a girl so
like i accepted people for i did not believe that they were better or worse by being homosexual and each of them have a right to i don't know to marry to
to be with whoever equal the same if is man or woman i do care i don't care and i believe they have the same rights because they are equal citizens and they pay taxes also
they should have the right to marry to live with anybody
mhm
sure but the fa the curch does not look like that
it believe it is an abomination because they define marriage as the union between a man and o woman and they believe and they and the people and the devoted christians fundementalists as i used to say before see that as an abomination and they are very closed that they do not understand that
that was before the traditional way of thinking before but now times are changing and everyone is well the same as before homosexuality has always existed from the beginning of manhood the thing is that before there was one way and now well
it goes thing are becoming more liberal let's say people are not afraid of saying well i am homosexual or i am gay or whatever they are
in san antonio yes
that is the problem the church has a problem but they can not do anything because
people are acceting the fact that other people well look he is homosexual and he does not care very good
sure
yes
yes the re the religion should be something personal not something to mix with politics each one can the what each thinks the believes belong to each one it does not have why to be
eh well look because you don't think the same as me you are not like me well that is how they punish them because they are not similar and it is not that everyone can think whatever they want believe in whoever they want or whatever they want don't have
for the christians because they speak poorly of muslims because they say that they are radicals or they speak poorly of the of the atheists because they do not believe in god and they call them heretics or
but i don't know
it's not very christian to be that way you have to accept people as they are and everyone has their beliefs or has their religion but that is the problem of the fundamentalists that they do not accept differences
mm
yes it's a very complicated and polemic subject
what happens is this it's that in this country that when children are in those types of families the christian families that are rightwing let's say that those children are raised in a way that that starting from birth they are taught that they need to be like this and this and this therefore
when they are older and meet people that are different then they say  it's not like that because they taught me that this and this and this and you have to be
you know they are very radical no they do not accept differences because they were raised by their parents so
for example i was lucky to travel a lot and meet people from many races from many cultures therefore i am well open to everything
and that is why when i see a person who is not i immediately recognize it just with one glance i say this person is not going to accept me because i am not like her i am not i do not think the same i do not look the same
but it is that there are classes there are people from many classes and and you have radical christians there has to be of all kinds but i believe it is true and that it strongly influences the country religion yes
yes
yes i know
sure yes yes yes
the message is very clear it has been five years since goverment and bill clinton has been in government well he was not as he was more open of course he was left more open another person
right
he understood things and personsthis government can we say its run by the that he the religious the christians from right or is what they are
saying how things are done in the country and that is why there is so much controversy with marriage there are also with the supreme court with with the judges that want to be right also and that they are religious well yes
be or catholics or whatever they also want that they take abortion rights and things then so it is it is ridiculus at this point in century
what how they want things to go back to back up instead of moving forward they want things to be the way they were thirty or forty years ago and that can not be
but this is why we are now
me in my family we arein spain i'am cacatholism lets say soon as you are born they baptize youfirst communion and all that well got married in church
i believe well i have my believe's but i do not go to church to service every sunday and do not practice you know practice i am i believe
but lets say i have it in my account lets say that the fela goes with me i know
or or i'm not i am very opened i mean i am a believer at catholic but im not don't know i am not funda nothing
yes yes yes theirs a lot of economic intrest
yes
that's the problem you can tell their not interested in the church goers they are intrested in the money
i also do not see them beign believers there has been many cases of infant abuse and children abuse
that you hear in one questions how can this be possible that one priest can do this to a child there is a lot of problem with thid
let say faith is each one don't know each one is free to believe what we want and practice but lets respect other that arnt the same
there are lots of religions and what happens is christian religion is the most abundant in the world is the most takes all power
yes but they do not have economic power that is the problem
oh yeas really these days in this country uh in the united states there's also a lot of a lot of problems with religion that gets mixed with politics and a lot of rightwing people who are the ones that want to control
they try to control the country through religion and it may seem positive or negative for a lot of people because it helps to pray and/or believing in something for some it helps and for others
hi hi my name is juan you are marisol
so they had a power very well very direct very clear trying to influence people there at the church
at the sermon what specially caught my attention against the public schools
directly against public school and they prayed that god will rid us from public school some day
because if
and against the theory that they try to teach the theory about evolution right
no terrible they said why are they harassing teachers that teach the bible to explain how the world was created
well i'll be damned well i said that actually no the bible doesn't explain the world
right they're fundamentalists right
yes
so i believe that maybe between more similar we are more problems no
maybe it's mariza we spoke to each other a few days ago right
on that sense the difference help to compliment
the talk the talk about homosexuality is very controvercial
but in one specific moment is not a oh lets go like tolerancy of phenomenon of the homosexuality should be something that that in which need to be very well informed no i personally for example was not thinking that
would mean about a deviation the homosexuallity but ultimatley i read that there is a issue one genetic charge
no
so yes
yes
yes yes i am in agreement with you exactly i believe that all have rights well we may have any other kind of persons and in this case the right regarding marriage
well many talk about the issue of homosexuality as something well very pervert and they deny the right to get married when in reality marriage is a contract
between two persons who decided to do something in common
maybe i'm at san antonio texas
no
aha
right yes well there is one very extreme that the family and the marriage the clerical institution and the blessing from god for the marriage and things when in reality
well the church and religion are an institution same as schools they have
first the need to change and find new new ways to learn thing of life
of society and of the individuals no
aha
well yes but in this case accepting differences seems to be related to humanity eh
like it's a paradox not to be able to accept that they think differently but aha
yes
hey well today's subject is the matter of religion right
aha
eh yes a big influence what astonishes me is that in this case
in this country to be so fundamentalist no
with the churches there is a large percentage of fundamentalists even in the speeches of the president there are a few fundamentalist thoughts
not there
yeah
yeah and you have do you practice a particular religion
sure
yes
the same thing happens to me and when i have closeness to chatholic church it is only temporary because when you have the feeling of integracion from community here is
well exactly like the need for religion is something we all have i guess
created intrests show all
no then
yes
yes
yeah
well in the world that we are in this side of the world nobecause i believe it is not the most christians i think there are more muslins then christians
mhm
and like with all needs institutions try to
give an answer for and it ends up being some form of control right
yeah you know in this case for example over here where i live i once went to a church
that well they represented a whole project of ideology but they really they're one of the most conservative groups there are in the united states right
hi good evening
columbian
yes i've had the truth is that i hope that technology keeps advancing i would say that in ten years time what else will they come up with no
because all that must keep on advancing no
mhm mhm

uh um
it's true because how long has cancer been around
and they can't find a cure for it right and they cand find it right
uh yes yes yes
uh um aids it's now spreading everywhere
well that's true
aha
yes yes
uh um ok

yes
too slow yes
yah ofcourse
yeah sure
what's up alex
mm mhm
mm yes of course
well for me too of course and i work my jo i am an administrator and so eh my job for me the computer so
the most essential and mainly in the new techniques right the new technology that has arrived and every day new things come out right
so the truth is i have adapted very well and have been fascinated since i have been using the computer well before they used this writing machine that was so slow to
write documents and forms and all now everything is done in the computer and the internet right it's something fascinating
for me it's essential
moving day after day right
you're right
right yes and for everything right that is it's everything that one
ah very good i am i'm from new york
wants he finds it there and so when one sits well i use it for work but also when i'm home and when i need
some information but i sit down in the computer and there is not one to stop me i don't know it's like something something essential and part of ones lifestyle right
for everything because if you need to know how the temperature is outside well you go to the computer
it was like that before mhm

and they gave it to and meanwhile they charged me
yes sure
ah how good that was
yeah okay
and you
how good would that be right yeah that would be excellent for calling to the country whenever you wanted i think that if you're going to arrive because with one of those cards also right every day
before it was really expensive you remember how it was to call to the country
right now it's incredibly cheap sure
that sure yes well yes
now you can talk for three four or five hours for five dollars
before it was a minute oh my god it was like eight
and yes i remember that i had to talk i believe it was only ten minutes and it cost me about twenty five dollars
and i had to be very careful and have the clock right in front of me no
yes aha
aha sure ah yes
yes good evening
mhm
since there's more demand
since technology was and is advancing
what i would like to see
more advanced technology is with medicine
they have to find cures for like cancer if you can go to the moon why can't they find a cure for cancer i'm sure they can if they can make
a super fast computer that can think why can't they find a cure for cancer
i want to sice more advancement in deseases i think they're going too slow in that matter
i haven't seen much advancement in diseases in the last ten twenty thirty forty years
well
yes and how many people it kills right
because here people speak mexican spanish
right and that shortens life for a lot of people
or or the heart illness too
aids is more advanced that cancer in in
in the way of being controlled because now they have drugs to control it
but cancer is going very slow i think
have you heard about a discovery of cancer
i haven't nothing
very slow
they could improve on that
yes
that's why
yes yes
i i had a friend that died young she was thirty two years old and she got cancer from one day to the next
and she died in three days
yes because she had a brain hemorrhage
and and she died immediately she had luki leukemia of of the blood
and that she got that from one day to the next
mhm and there was nothing that could be done no
i haven't no eh a
one gets one gets the accent from where you live
with the when i was living in spain i had the a the spanish accent
when i was living in colombia i had the colombian spanish from bogota specifically
now it's the turn of mexican spanish
that is what is spoken here
oh ah oh i think that hispanics here are about ninety five per cent mexican
yes
ah how are you carolina you are speaking with alex
yes ah i use use computers
and ah i have the dsl quickly now
yes i love it because of the quick internet i don't like to wait for the pages
so for me it's very usefull because i look for work i make find search women
many many things and and i don't like to wait for the pages you understand
i like to do it quick and and before when i was when i had the line over telephone
it was too slow
and so had i had to wait two or three minutes only for a page to appear
and up until now well had webcam and an the webcame was quick with the d s l
the webcam is when they can see you ah over tele co video conference
from los angeles
it's quick
and you
yes
mm of course i think that they have they have made more advances in computing than they have done with medicine
the computer is the greatest advancement in civilization right now
yes
yes exactly
news sports
ah going out with women everything
no and even this survey we're filling right now i found it through the computer too
oh okay i thought that that that you were someone else are you well
yes hmm then the computer has a lot of influence
in our lives 22 this is sh eh 22 calls
almost i still have to make 3 but in one call the person spoke more in english then i i think i'll have to replace him
but but who knows
because i spoke in spanish then i think they'll accept it
because if you speak in english no they won't accept it
if you make a a call to replace another
i spoke to him i know this thing's owner
yes i will ask if i have to replace him
yes
i'm here from los angeles
yes it is very easy to talk with him
no he must be from philadelphia
but he gave me the telephone
no no no no
yes i know him through the computer but he
but he take part of the conversation with other people
ok then you can ask anything he's chinese
yes well he is the owner
