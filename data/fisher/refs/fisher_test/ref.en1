hello
yeah yeah i'm almost done now
so there are many things like that too so everything everything depends on the class but
eh yes here yes there is an i i barely write anything in general so it seems a bit strange that i had to write
but em and what else and now and the and the weather here it du i'm sure you don't like it right
too too cold here right
yes
nah yes
hm
pe
but in peru they told me there are regions where it is very cold right
hm mm
but but what
hm i see
well i'm in wharton
then business yes but then you're studying a phd a master's what is it exactly
ah it's undergraduate ah okay okay
ah but you're here now
you live in peru then
do you live in peru
ah
then you're a freshman or
hi good evening who is this
ah okay then you're not exchange student you're transfer
oh oh that's good
oh good and what do you think so far
yeah but that's because of the english or
everything all the work
yes yes
yes
more than in perú
uh um
uh um
oh guillermo
uh um
ah okay okay
yes yes
yes but i mean it still is pretty intensive
yes is hard
um depends and in general five but ah sometimes is only like but at the end last cycle i only took four but now i'm taking five
and but generally in in college people only take four
i think so yes but in wharton in general people take five
eh
yeah i have yes i have a little job there in the library is work study but is there is not really a job because when i'm there
oh its me jose
i study so is not really like that
mm
ah i used to do that sometimes but which one are you on which part of the library in
mm okay okay
in lippincott
it's a library in wharton
yes it's on the second floor mm no but yes it's there it's a good job because i only work i don't work for longer that five hours per week sometimes i work ten hours per week but
still i have time to do my homework so it really is not that sometimes sometimes towards the end we do have a little bit of more work because
more people need our help and everybody
are doing research and in general it's quite i don't have a lot of work to do
oh pe i live in philadelphia
but here i've seen that for example sometimes jobs in latin america but did you see that in europe
in the universities during the well in general they don't really work that much until the end then the professors
yes yes in europe in general true
hm mm
hm mm
yes yes yes
yes well well well they can no they do not give much work but eh in general they want that we supposed real that one is
that we read everything that we exercise and do that all that right
i understand all right and then at the end they give us an exam and that is your note but here in united states is
different right because here especially here in history they have investigation and then a practice then something else and an exam and
yeah yeah what about you
is better in the scense that one okay there are less risks ay
he trabayes yes but
yes
yes
yes
yes yes yes no but also there are but all the work they give you i mean yes every week you have one thing and another
another job another job then
each one has its system it has its advantages but in and in peru how is it in general
hm mm
hm mm
oh what are you studying
hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
hm hm mm hm mm
yes
hmm
yes yes
yes yes
hmmm hmmm
yes hmmm hmm
oh i'm a student as well im a senior
yes yes
yes
yes yes
yes good it's it's different because in wharton well it also depends good depends because for example i say the classes that i took in general they don't have
like essays or research projects just in general there's two three tests and and that's it but there are classes for example that have more to do than just that like well one has two exams but you also have to do projects
those kinds of things like case studies
in groups usually these days almost everything's in groups and sure if they give you work things things so that you are reviewing because if they didn't
because and and and i liked it like that for example every week to have work small stuff that you have to turn in because that way
you're forcing the person to study each and every week
but yes that that that i liked that sometimes they do that but usually there's exams or projects but in
from the university of pennsylvania as well
every class they always have a test i don't i've never have had a class where it just consists of projects really but usually two tests and maybe a project
in the well now we have a marketing class we have a a project that is like a i don't how they did it eh eh and
they made a whole software program that was like a simulation and then one for example every request well there's like five orders or six orders then
everyone has a group
and so the whole world to each group they assign a a company
so you have several products this company has several products so one has to decide based on on each product well where we go what kind of
ho ho how we're going to sell this product we're going to
sell more yes yes it's it's like one one is in a com of course it's not like in real life but
it helps yes yes it's not it's no interesting but ba then after wards when that's over you have to write several like that essays do an analysis
of what one did of the the mistakes of what one did right
hi
oh that's good
i would say thatoh it i had gone to the mountains from peru and thing on vacation with my family and yes at nights
it could be colder that until now i have experienced here
and you what's what are you studying
hm
it's uh no undergraduate
hmm hmm hmm
sorry
i sorry what did you say
yes i live in peru until until three months ago
sure uhmm
no what happens is i studied two years in the university in peru and then i transferred here i'm an international transfer
how are you eh i'm guillermo how are you
sure it's i mean i'm getting graduate with a diploma from this university
instead of a exchange student for example right
uh it's a little hard actually
and n well the english the english is in fact a let's say
it's a difficulty i mean uh uh i have i have studied english for a long time in my life but still it's harder to explain myself in english than in spanish
right i mean that's uh that's very clear to me
uh but also yes by the amount of work that i get that's also a
i yes i think so they send you more
more more than in perú even last cycle i in perú er in my university i took six courses er in a semester
and even so i think i had less work than what i'm having now taking five courses
yeah
but well the thing is that i'm taking five courses but also working
i don't know suddenly that's the equivalent of taking six courses something like that
perhaps is a little less i don't think that is as as demanding like taking six course but
i think so yes i don't know perhaps in the future i decide
i i i'll decide to take less courses i don't know how many courses do you take more or less per cycle
okay and and you
yes
i understand and besides you work or
or are you dedicated full time to to your studies
ah that seems very advantageous what you do i also work in the in the library but i'm a shelver
how are you where are you from
so i really have no time to study
in the fifth floor of van pelt
and you where do you work
where's that
i see
hm mm
hm mm
ah in england for example
yes i've heard that too i mean the amount of work for example the number of hours that they take per week
they are i think less then three
philadelphia
then we have a lot of free time or lets say does not have many classes
and apart i think yes or they do not give you a lot of work i am not sure no
sure hm mm hm mm
hm mm
yes sure that that that that this difinitely that is an advantage that there are less risk
because really imagine that for example you go to to to to to decide your course note in your exam and all of a sudden the prevous night you could not sleep well o
anything can happen an all of a sudden
in the exam you don't make it or i say you could have prepared a lot but for x reason you did not do well in the exam
i mean let's say the note
it it the note goes down no i mean i don't know
well i'm peruvian im currently studying in the university of pennsylvania
yes yes yes
let's see i mean i would tell you also they make us work i mean we don't like the the equivalent to midterms
but that are primarily reading tests
eh throughout i mean scattered let's say throughout the semester
and for some classes not all they also ask you at the end of the class to to hand in an essay a research project
and besides you also have a final exam but let's say you don't have to produce as much as you produce here
i mean you don't have to write so much
here they have you constantly writing papers and reviews isn't it like that
not much beyond or rather beyond what you had to write for example write for examination or deliver or in research
at the end of the semester but beyond that no you did not have to produce much
i'm studying history
well i mean that could be seen as an advantage the sense that you don't have do not no do not ask for much not true or is
you can live a little more relaxed
but at this point the downside is that you do not get you can not practice you do not you're not in a constant practice of the work
of research nor how to describe not true or sometimes yo not to describe all that you lose a little not all but to describe then
i tell you that like is more like easier like
it's a lot easier but i don't know that tell you if they prepare you like they do here
but it costs that your prep like the cos is that here they prepare you better right but at least i for example this weekend i'm full of stuff to dom then
you live a little more like at least i live a little more anxious say that a little more
stressed
but i don't know what it would be like in wharton i don't know
what university
ya
and they are just personal tasks or group ones
sure
hm mm
hm mm hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
ah how interesting
but i mean it's similar in a way
hm mm
oh really
hm mm
yeah
how come
well yes yes yes yes on tuesday i think it was at night i think it was raining
i was frozen yes i mean i have to carry my coat i mean with my i have es i i bought a coat that's fairly warm
and i have for i mean i always go out with it but even so even sometimes using my coat i'm cold too no but well inside my dorm it is much more well
driving the matternot inside the dorm the temperature is that it is enough
hot no
well sureyes if you go to the mountain that is
also at night also if you go in winter to the mountain on on winter eh the winter nights on the mountain are very cold yes
hello my name is gloria
from ah okay i'm catholic i i believe am it separates some and unites others for example i have a nephew that is gay
really oh yeah i think shes from georgia
yea atlanta yea yea yea yea
oh in oh
oh okay okay i had a cousin that lived in georgia but then moved she still lives in georgia but had to sell her house because she got divorced
so she had to sell the house and now shes alone yeah
yeah my niece yes she's like fortysomething years old
yeah
so them in the catholic religion they don't accept gay people
because god didn't make them like that but i remember that when my my nephew was born at one year we knew that him what he what he was going to be
people don't believe that they're born like that but he really was born like that and only if you have someone like that in your family you know so he
he's got a lot of trouble with the catholic religion because they don't accept him and he knows they don't accept him but he finally found a church on the thirty two in new york that accepts homosexuals
um right
um
right
um
exactly
oh from new york
um
um
mhm
aha aha
yes yes yes like this who've said in my lunch time the girls that i work with where i work three
i carry this this little book by joyce myers and he everyday scriptures so i read it to them and they say that's shit and i'm like but
hey she's saying treat your neighbors kindly like you would like them to treat you and she's like oh no i don't have to treat them right
i don't like her i say but everybody has been created as god's image and so we started fighting i said look i want peace because that's what it matters and i don't so that i don't
speak of that subject again but forget about it it's been done and they still want to hang out with me so that i read to them everyday
because it was like a firecracker i was telling her that i don't want to be near her because she takes my
from long island
energy away from me and she's always criticizing everybody else and i don't want to i don't want to be in that environment and they she says yes and i go and read to them everyday and the other days they say
write five things that you are grateful to god for ehm am that you think that you forget it she's always like ah you are always reading religious stuff
and i say that's the only thing that has saved me because otherwise i would be gossiping everybody speaks of me and i know that i'm a good person god created me this way
and if i let people hurt me i would've jumped out of a window
so that's what happens to her they criticize her so i tell her hey god loves you the way you are but you have you can't be criticizing other people
yes
aha
yes aha
aha
yes yes yes yes yes yes
from long island
aha aha
it's like the eh eh it's like catholicism everybody is leaving it like my my friend left for another church she tells me that
this and that and this and that and i say you have to find a church where you really want to be that you believe in that you are satisfied with it
or that i won't tell you to go to a catholic church if it's not doing anything for you because i go to a catholic church
so then she told me that she had found another church and she told me  maybe you should go with me and i said no leave me alone i will stay where i am i'm happy where i am
you know i go to charismatic prayer groups so then i don't like to attend other churches i won't tell you why i don't go but i don't want her to
i haven't go to that church for a long time and they spend their whole sunday there i don't have a whole sunday to spend there
three four hours
aha
oh eh i believe that christian science something like that
aha
yes yes yes they are like born again christians something like that
something like that yes so then you know i was catholic but my husband goes to the catholic church i in my house the only one that goes to church is me my kid doesn't like to go i'm always arguing with him to go
and he doesn't believe that god is helping him it's me everyday i tell him you see this god gave to you like today we were talking about
of katrina and he says oh god did that that
and i couldn't convince him that it wasn't god that it was an act you know an act of god how they say but it wasn't
god himself that he doesn't let that even though the bible said things like that were going to happen i was telling him maybe you should read the bible it teaches you what there is
mm
aha yes
aha
aha aha yeah
oh from georgia oh my god
exactly they sit there and when the priest finishes they leave they run
yes
isyes yes like last time i'm attending to a charismatic group but i'm understanding more even though they saying it in spanish and i don't understand it but i could speak spanish but i can't read it not even write it
then they gave a spanish bible as a present and me forgetting that i'm reading it but i don't know then i go and i explain them i read this and this and this
that is what it is then they read it in english to see if i understand them but it gets too difficult the bible is is
exactly exactly that i find it very hard so i they give me passages and then i read it and then they tell me this is this and this and this
you know and and they start it to use it like we do and i said oh okay then i understand
i'm puerto rican
yea yea yea yes i was born in puerto rico but i was raised in new york or whatever my place says this places that they called it manhattan
if you know if you from georgia
i didn't understand what she said
oh from chile ah okay
but i'm going to flight
ah
wow wow wow wow
wow
aha aha
aha
wow you guys travel a lot
aha that's good that's good to move like that you see i lived
i lived in manhattan then i lived in the bronx and now i moved to long island and we stayed here even though when we retire we are going to live i guess
something religious she said that she talks
in florida because my son my older son and my grandkids live in florida
so i would like to go i would like to go to florida to be near them but from now til i go my grandson might already be married
because he's already seventeen from now til i retire is ten more years he'll be twentyseven maybe he'll get married
i'm going to be of the bis i aha
yes
aha
oh where there is work and what's your job there
oh oh you're at home with your kids ah that's good
oh my god yes yes it's a lot of work right i do ki kid's parties i dress up as a clown and now i'm trying to think how to make an elmo head
because i have the the bodysuit but
no
the head belongs to my friend so she and i do parties so sometimes they ask for two and we can not go only one can go
so i've been trying my friend is making it but the head is too heavy so i can't imagine how we're going to make that head
so and and through that because that's why i wasn't listening to what the lady was saying because a tape of and i say oh i'm doing too many things i must concentrate
everything at the same time because sometimes they call and don't call and and sometimes i pick it up and i don't pick it up and and they had already they had already given me this discussion last week i don't know why they discuss the same thing
have you been doing this for a long time
oh like me yeah something like that
oh okay yeah
oh ok i've got a friend and her name is norma i think she lives in georgia as well
yes yes yes she is peruvian yes
yes yes yes i've talked to her about four times already
hello
i was talking about religion what is you opinion about it if unites people or separates them if we all need to have the same religion or what do i know
right
right well i think that as far as religion that if people followed their religion there wouldn't be so much trouble like when the ones that go to the extremes in any religion
if people followed for example the ones that followed jesus christ if they followed jesus christ teachings and id they acted like jesus christ
there wouldn't be so many problems
but when they start fighting that's not what he taught
jesus christ
where there's trouble
the same with the muslims
or the jewish the principles of of those religions and what they preach
hello gloria i'm paulina where you calling from
yes that's they are good things when people become fanatics and fail to accept other people fail to respect the differences
i think that's when division problems arise
that's good
yes
and that's true the same thing happens when
between people in religion as a community you the see what happens in israel between the
between palestinian and the
and the jews
it's sad they fight all the time
because they are sacred places for the two of them but they don't respect
new york i'm from georgia
other people
ah yes
what's religion is that the one of your friend
oh
okay
mm
mm yes
that' how it is i find that as far as religion many people just go because of tradition only and
when you go and search for him the truth
and really search there you find a religion that
ah
you like but many people that only go only for tradition but they don't even know what their own religion is about
if they don't study these writings by themselves or nothing
yes it helps when someone starts to study of what they believe in their own religion
the bible yes the bible is difficult the vocabulary that that use anyways it does matter the language that i had found out
mm where are you from
puerto rican but raised in the united states
okay i don't know
oh from chile ah okay
yes i grew up and i was raised in chile when i had finished high school i came to study to the university

good evening how are you
ah so for for me i mean for me i need music for everything i need it for when i'm working when i'm studying
eh i always like to have music on is what keeps me alert i suppose so for me yes music yes extremely important
and is fundamental eh
it helps me concentrate it helps me relax i think to me music can change your mood yes i can be
very quiet and then i listen to a song and i can change to a bad mood or i can be in a pretty bad mood and then i listen to a song that makes me cheerful

in general the type of concert i go to the most is more eh is rock in english and anyways the people that go are more like
really young and is like too loud that's why for that it doesn't appeal to much to me to go to those concerts
ah
nice to meet you

promotions and
yes
yes ah already i i would have loved to have eh eh to be able to play an instrument but i am very bad at that but for me for me the
musi music that for me it is well very necessary for me eh i a i for me i love it i mean eh i am i can be ah
i i remember songs of of many songs of
okay eh how old are you
songs that i can spend years without hearing and at the moment the in eh i hear the the song again and after years i can sing the complete song
ah then i to me to me it depends of of what state of spirit i have the go like that and
like i have like and ipod you know wha ipod's are
eh for me then eh a have like ten thousand in in that on that ipod
and then i have almost all have some ah a music list that only has music for for of bai of dancing dance music
have a complete list that is eh only rock in eh in english that is basically i use it for when i go to the gym
i have a list that is eh of only spanish music on other list that only has like classical music opera things like
to relax
eh i have an eh a list pu eh on the contrary to me eh to be able to study i can't have that type of classical musci i need music
it should have lyrics because if it does not have if it does not have lyrics makes me bored i need something that entertains me
twenty five
eh eh with work with virus
in biology
this way is always i need something to keep me entertained something that takes my attention
yes yes if i put music it has to be no classical music
i i got sleepy i put classical music when i have lots when i have eh if i have to write a a report i have to concentrate a lot a lot a lot
well then but always since i was little always when i had to study i always listened to music and while singing i could read and my father always made critiques about it
it is impossible for a persons to read and sing at the same time but i don´t know for me it always worked i always got good grades so
i su i suppose that
no
yes that does not does not atract me at all the music i mean eh it can
okay sorry
twenty eight ah me too
good evening
aha
and and you
and i specially like live music a lot
live music
aha
okay
aha
exactly
exa
exact
yes how are you
exactly exactly no yes me too i because no eh i play an instrument and my husband plays an instrument too so at least ah maybe in a festival or something
there's a bar near our house and lots of people come play every night people just sit and play instruments
and they have like open circles every night and they have songs where people come and play so in the weekends many different music groups come and play
play during the nights on the weekends and that's so cool
i like everything
eh i don't like or at least i don't like rap or hiphop that much i like pop music ah
yes britney spears i don't like i don't like her it's not interesting to me
i like ah i like ah everything rock in spanish i've got a lot rock in spanish songs and bluegrass so
well i like fito paez it's rock in spanish
he's from argentina
ah i am josma from philadelphia
yes i like him a lot
and me like american music there's a man that his name is that he's very good
and the one that died oh that was also a very very good singer but at least here where i live there's a lot of people that play
many of our friends that play and sing and have bands
and all the groups that they have are are very very good also
well and i at least this year went to a concert of oh willy nelson
and bob dylan
and there were people of all ages there were people that were like sixty or seventy years old and there were even ten eight year old kids in the concert
yes and really nice they do them in a small stadium in a small baseball stadium and there weren't there weren't that many people but
but yes it was very very good the concert
how are you doing
well yes more than anything we buy music but also we much music from groups for this reason no no they are not so popular that is how it people that we know
yes because we are member of a a music society of folklore music in philadelphia so then at least there are a lot of musicians
that are members of do concerts in the houses all that all the months
there is a concert in in a house of a member and we buy all those cd's
of groups that we see for this reason if they are not like very very famous but they are really good
and sometimes we have have seen groups that we
we did not know they were famous and all of a sudden we are listening to them we were in a festival or something
and all of a sudden we are listening to a song that is very famous
but
no no no my husband played before in a group because that is that group is not together again maybe they they will get together again
about music well ah i listen some latin music and some american music like folklore and bluegrass country music
but no we don't play for any group or sometimes my husband who plays with his friends but what happens is that we don't have time so there is a lot like to
to to commit like this with people
because for work and that we don't and and then we don't have time to commit if with a group because if you have a group you have to practice at least one day
week
ok
then yes you have to dedicate a lot of time and he at least there is a group that wants that my husband goes and plays with them
but where they get together they get together wednesdays at night like at ten at night and then practice like until two in the morning on wednesdays
like they have to work and in school and that he doesn't have time
mm
for me that if it happens that i if i go too much time without singing a song to me i forget but i i was the other time i was talking with a friend and
twenty five
and we were with her we heard a song on the radio that i had not heard for like eight years and she remembered the whole song
and after that they passed a song that i didn't listen for almost four years all that time without hearing it and i knew the song and
he knew that i knew it but i couldn't remember the lyrics of the song but i remembered a little no much i would have forgotten if not if
i didn't listened all the time forget the lyrics that's why i know the song but the lyrics not that much
aha
aha
exac
ay and for studying
yes
what what are you studying
mm oh twenty eight
ok
ok
exactly
mn
i had a female professor
that used to say that when no when you are studying something that you have something you have to learn if you sing the things you need to learn you learn more
faster than reading in a normal way
twenty eight
ah
hello have you talked to fabiola
if i say the same
we bought them in jcpenny
we are getting everything by different parts we first got the curtains i received the other part last night the top part
then i got the other top part and i still need three more curtains they haven't arrived yet
the living room curtains because i haven't put on the outer window part yet
no because the rest of the house got it put on but the living room not because they are not actually windows
so there's no such thing for that kind of size you have to make one yourself
aha the best that ever happened to me was to meet my husband
and the second and the other best that ever happened to me was to have my children
be healthy and being healthy
and really
yes
why goods topics are good because you find good conversational topics when you talk here because they add music too there was music yesterday
eh yes and it's enjoyable you talk twelve minutes and they themselves cut you out
yes they say you have thirty seconds left to say goodbye
and so we have twelve minutes to talk about whatever we want because they are checking our voices
aha and that's how it works and you pay for it
you must talk you must talk about what they say you or whatever you want the idea is to have a conversation because that's all all the conversation is being recorded
who is who
by the accent the system is the way of speaking and
the tone of voice and they are inventing something
so then they need people that have different voices
and the
yes the little ones all connect through this number
yes they speak at the same time at the hour
and and they connect well they connect well
yes but i know if you can make two calls at the same time
cool or not and that is the issue i told you to bring up as a topic of discussion
yeah that i don't know i hear the voice of the children beautiful
it can be heard very super clearly yeah
they are and what are you doing to them that is making them laugh
they look at each other and laugh and they say hey you look like me no no no you look like me
children are funny ooh they are growing and do you talk to them
do you have to talk to them now or not
if talk to them do you talk to the children
in english
ohh
in english that's great because they will understand both languages
about the best thing that has happened in my life
yes
him imagine me a geni with the two languages also uh he speakes to me in both languages uh he can now read both languages but he also has an accent and he has trouble with spanish
and despite that since little and had her first three years born here
but at two months and half i took her to chile and it was the same at chile
it's that she learn just words she couldn't say complete phrases because him
we came here every year on vacation and a month here
and the dad always spoke to her in english
and of course and then uh he and when she listened she listened a bad spanish from michel
or a bad english from me
now i speak a better english michel speaks a better spanish and she can now read both languajes and she's better but they do get confused when the dad
and how has it changed your life
speaks with an accent and with a strong accent
isn't that bad
not good no
yes from four months on before kids start to
and you have planned what are you going to do for christmas or thanksgiving
i see
yes
for christmas are you already planning the gifts and everything
the gifts are you planning for christmas or not
not yet
and what other good things happened in your life
me the kid the kids are already big for the christmas they're going to play
that's beautiful
ah i'm thinking of buying we'll buy a tree
we bought a live one every year
um we're going to see if michael doesn't look at a new car
yes
a large remote control car
it's usually one hundred and sixty dollars but i found it on sale for fifty dollars
the same as james bone
but the james bone remote control car i'll put as a gift from santa clause
but it's the best thing that you feel has ever happened in your life
for jenny i still having found anything she really wants and would love a game boy for christmas
that you that doesn't use little keys you touch the little things and it starts moving
one super super new that came out
so that i think that i am going to put that one so that she that i know what is it that she wants
and a karaoke
aha yes it sings it is good because at the age she is at they are reading at the same rate that the letters come out and they go getting darker changing color
then it is singing the song
and yes she is entertained a ot and i tell her that it is good so she can read faster those it is it is super good for christmas and to to my fatherinlaw
i bought ehm a gift on behalf of jonathan
that is a
that's a good topic
for the computer it has ehm to move the mouse
move the mouse and it has a calculator
no no no the part where you move the mouse it´s a little square
and that
so i bought one for my father inlaw and one for us
hey i believe that´s a good idea
no we already bought the bus tickets we are going to go to arkansas for about a week
mhm every year we go for one week
oh yeah
no but it hasn't started yet
yes
so no one really knows what would happen
they told him that it's that they have staff in case of anything that could happen that they will let know
it's like we'll call you later
but it turns out that he still hasn't started his job in chile
it's still i got excited to i told michel michel if you get it we'll go
michel yes yes but
oh um its the same thing i think but how are we going to leave if we recently bought this house how he says
we will sell it and it makes me laugh because for him its really easy to get rid of things
and it costs me so much work
yeah then i had to decorate it i haven't even put on curtains i'm getting closer little by little
hello hello
i think everyone meets someone else because they had not known not to
huh
and they are are they the living room curtain
oh you haven't put on the outer window part
ahh
specially for it
this children wouldn't be here
yes because like
yes
yes because if i wasn't met the guy i won't i won't be here
another weren't have those children i wouldn't have met you either
if it weren't for him not even
yes
hey i like them
ohh
and connected so it will work
but eh how it's called you mustn't talk about what they say to you
oh so later the computer can know that uh
and therefore by the accent
mm
yes for the
oh no idea and i had not called because i say no i could not call
much earlier
yes
ehh
i'm i'm going to try then to call after later or at midday maybe i dont know
oh you should also see if
the same day
if you hear it it's because they are here they are
both are laughing
they are they are both here sitting on my legs and are in front of each other and they look at each other and laugh
and one is is that they have the pacifier tied to the bib so then he is pulling the pacifier that the other one had and he pulls it like this
oh
what
yes yes i talk to them yes i talk to them i talk to them all the time and i talk to them in
in spanish
and you do you talk to them in english
then we must speak about memories
yes because yes yes they grow up with both languages
because and they also grow up with a not having accent
uh
m
and where did she learn to speak did she learn to speak when she was in chile yes well
ohh
oh
oh so she was kinda confused
m
oh
ah
the the wrong i'm doing i mean i speak to them in spanish but the problem is that for example when i'm with another person and they speak english
i talk to them in english you see
why not but maybe it's bad because no because my accent isn't understood
and i know they're little now they're not going to not going to talk now but that oh maybe it's all getting recorded there then
it's just that
for thanksgiving we're going to go with my with armi's grandparents come to eat because my
my motherinlaw is fixing the house
so we're going to have to go where his grandparents and them together
what
hmm no not yet not yet no
okay
and you
yes
do you already have plans for christmas
m
eh
for real
a real car or what
ahh
and what type of car is it
ohhh
ahh artas things
huh
m oh okay
yes
oh
and what did you give her on her birthday
a karaoke and do you play with it or not
m
ohh
m
for the
ahh
ehm
does the mouse have a calculator
that one the little thing made out of plastic
oh ok
hey
are they going to be there for christmas
a week
oh cristina was thinking of goign back to chile for work
and that din´t work out well
but she said that maybe no who knows why
if i met someone with children
mm
yes
something like that
ahh
he'd go
m
um
why did it cost you so much you found that house
huh
m
hello
yes
well and on what subjects more than anything
aha
ah okay i see
uh huh
alright okay i see
mm
yes
aha
mm
yes of course
yes exactly
ah okay
yes but it's like that because i say already in high school they are beginning to specialize more in subject areas for instance chemistry is more advanced and physics is more advanced
aha
yes
yes
yes yes yes
yes no
mhm
mhm
yes yes i hate that
did you study or work
much very good much luck
but if you say also you're only have two years there isn't a need to think of that
right
mmhmm
yes right
ok
mmhmm
yes if you read
yes
yes if you know the order
oh how cute
yes that's good
yes sounds sounds pretty interesting
that i don't know anything i don't know how that is yes i was in that situation i don't know how i would do because i never would have imagined how
to give classes to my son myself i could not do it because i also tell you the truth i am not so imean ehm i didn't have an education on how to give classes do you understand me
i imagine that you must have studied something like about education or something like that no
or what did you study
yes no
aha
sure sure sure that you got all of the the schools gave classes
hmm
yeah well of course
yes of course there's much work in the house i guess
very happy that's good but i guess not
if the child is four days
wow a little bit
and this young man heard that that you live in the us have you lived there all your life
who's speaking
okay
mh mhm
mhm
okay
ah okay
aha
ah okay
ah very little
ah okay
yes
hello anny i'm arturo
yes yes i understand
and now you are married with is with latin or with an american
oh okay i see
oh okay from there in in miami i supposed
oh okay
okay
oh i see that's great
and
and what and what language you speak with with with your well right now you don't even speak your children because
he is twentyfour months the other one
where are you calling from
twentythree yes this one can´t
mm
okay
ah okay
identify them
ah yes
ah really
wow aha
very fast
also no so at what age do kids start talking normally i don't really know
from miami very good i speak from
okay
aha
yes yes
yes
yes
ah
yes but
sure yes it should be a lot more difficult but well i believe well in the long term it is going to be very good also no that way you grow up with two languages and that is a strenght
the truth
mm
philadelphia
yes yes i imagine
yes
yes of course but the kids they're very astute later later aren't they
you know
hmm
well yes i hope it goes on like that because then when she starts growing and more of her friends speak english well they're going to practice english i think aren't they
oh ok
ah
aha
yeah that's true
yes where are you from
but but and what do you think about i mean that she's not going to have school friends that that
that is an experience too no i mean
ok
ah ok
oh ok
the
ahh ok
yes
yes sure that is what i was thinking because if i mean a part of the experience of be in the school is get to know people
then i think so that is important that it doesn't matter when you are a kid because its true that you're friends are very relevant
ah okay
i don't think so
but yes as long as you have contact with other people at least one week but
there is much it is that here there is a lot of contribution from the community of course and that
yes i see
yes yes yes yes i like i mean in mexico this is not common you understand it doesn't happen at all
then i don't know people like that who has come out of that type of schools you understand in and always i am very curious as to how they do it here in the united states because here it is much more common there are many people that
that comes out of school at home oh well at least before now i don't know
yes yes yes yes
yes they can be very bad too true
yes of course but you have to be careful because then it is bad about protecting them
i'm mexican
it can be very bad
yes
yes yes
yes that's true and until what grade you have planned to do the homeschooling
yes
time will tell
how do you think so you you think teaching all elementary or what
okay
ah yes
then you have have taught even in high school or what
hello
are you studying here in the united states
and so i was teaching everything
and just so that you know the only thing that i if i didn't know something
if i don't know the issue or whatever well then i would teach myself so that i would be able to teach the children
so then you know like things like say algebra
it's not that i don't know but it can also more possible that i just had forgot
because if i don't use ut
well eh you know well before teaching the class what i was doing was that i was that i as i was remembering
it was what i had to do
so that i could teach them
well you know for me that isn't very hard i know that for other people it can be hard but for me
good
and also that time i know that now
they even classes of that the children can take or the children can take on the computer
and they can go to a high school we're going to say on the internet
so you know there's many many many options that isn't really of
you know that one has to
to put them in a public school also
you know i know that the university here
they have classes for children also in high school that they can take in the university
so you know we have many options
and what
no i have a child of twenty three months and i've had her for four days now
no but as my husband says you know that i'm a teacher
and i'm always reading books i'm you know singing songs
so she's not you know having fun but at the same time i'm always learning something
so you don't know if i am giving formal schooling
but if i'm giving you or i'm raising
little by little she knows her abc's well at she knows the song
yes right then she knows her numbers
a little you know if i say one she can tell me two three then next to me she says you know that eight comes after seven you know things like that
yes if not all little by little
so you know so
so no i'm working but not
yes
hmm
well ehm
i studied education if but they didn't teach me exactly like to teach let's say how to teach a child how to read
all of those things i had to learn when i was working
so i am using that experience
yes but for that reason is that you you know for me for me to do with the with my with my children
it is not a problem because i already have the experience i don't know you know how the other people does it
no outdoors
yes
yes i'm a little tired now but happy
four days
yes
yes eh my parents are from the dominican republic
my name is anny
and in 1970 something or whenever it was
ah i think it was sixtythree i'm not sure
but a revolution in santo domingo
and they went to live in puerto rico
then they spent twenty years there
then my sister when she went to college came here to the state of florida then we moved to miami
and i was about i think i was five years old
yes my sister kept me for ten eleven years
then we you know we left and
eh i went to school here and you know we made a life here
hello arturo
and
an american
yes i met him at the university
no eh i went to
in
so then i met him there
so then
after the oh
well
eh the has twentythree months and the other one has four days
from miami
i what we do is that when he is not here in my husband is not in the house
i speak full spanish to my daughter
then when he is here we speak full english
so she can learn both languages
and and i get surprised because a lot of times she says things
that i even didn't notice she already learned
it can be in english or spanish
so she is getting it
yes
and mm i think it was she was let's say fifteen sixteen months
from where
as she is learning english and spanish
eh it takes for children that do that it takes a little more time of talking
my girt caught it you know and her friends or whatever the little friends
eh they speak cleary and more than her
ah until recently
then now her i knew she is she understoo y could talk
but having the two languages it was a little more difficult
yes yes
then eh but you know her i know she understood
what i was saying in english and in spanish
philadelphia
and now you know particularly i know that she understands me because when there is something she does not want to do she act like a fool and you know
i see her face and i know she understands exactly
yes yes
so but you know she understands it she talks it
and
yes and no huh we aren't sending her to school we're going to do homeschooling
because i am i was a teacher
so i think that for me to go to work and teach to you know sons or kids of someone else for that i'd rather stay home
and i can teach my own kids
so that
eh puerto rican
well
yes you have many programs here in miami for the people that teach their children in home
then normally once in a week they put them together
then its like a school it can be like lets go say the class in church or in an university or whatever but is like a school you have to go once in a week
so you know also with your friends and everything else i have many friends and family members that have do that
mmm and they have no problem
but you know there isn't something
because that's my worried too i want she has friends and friendship and all that
yes yes
yes yes
and you
yes yes
and also you know they have sports the of eh the eh i mean the community places
yes so you know things like that it is how they it is like they say they socialize themselves
so that you know
yes
yes he the this you know it is like any other experience it is like a the the tak you know it can be good it can be bad
but i also think that like schools are here also are like the kids
yes that that also i would like that if she has you know friends and all these things but at the same time i think that i have to protect her
yes yes
yes not i but for that reason it is that i want to teach because i can teach him anything but it depends how i present it to him
ah
yo know
is a little different that let's say how they present it in school
ahm don't know eh i didn't think of that as she has only two years
and i didn't start
yes so then
ah could be probably until until at least until sixth grade
then from there then let's carry on because i don't know you know i i can teach her until she reaches high school
ah
yes yes
eh right my i was a special education teacher
hello good afternoon my name is lorena i'm here in san antonio texas
because because they're now grown up they bring me well so much beautiful things that maybe by myself it wouldn't be enough to bring me so much memories and so much
ehm positive and negative emotions then all isn't beautiful too no precisaly i have a son that that have some pro a health problem and that is painful too
and it's good but maybe my emotions are more loving more tender and more eh good and this the husband right husband
they also have much much to do
in in one's life no and this
but i i would think that there may be nothing more than a just a single event
now a painful event a painful memory of the death of my mom for example
yes yes yes or illness of my son too not that well
is very painful but as i say one can not say that only one eh but nice try not to think about it
eh yes
hi eh today's topic is frankly touching huh
exactly exactly mhm
uh um your husband you met him where
right because you are spanish
right yeah
right
yeah of course yeah
yeah yeah and and really it's a lot of stuff and so many stages
but but well at this age when they're little that's the most lovely
uh um it's the most lovely and well now when they grow up and they live on their own well for example that's nice but you don't get the
hi mom i did well in this and  hey mom well this that's more like a conversation level like at a level
exactly now i said well it's going to be the memories i said well the memories are like precisely the most important thing that life can bring you because one lives like of memories right
there's not much dependence there's not much closeness
but but it's nice it's really nice and then what's the best that has happened to you your best memory
yeah
yes
yes right right now for me it's been immediate too i thought that since i've had good times you'll have nice memories in life of every achievement you had
well as a person or in sports or in academics or at work no
yes right
exactly exactly and nevertheless you start accumulating
memories in pictures of christmases and in pictures of school festivals and in pictures of your kids' sports festivals
it's like piecing together this life because it's like it's made of memories no
ah
mhm yes because this is like very like very complete like very you don't study to be a mom you don't study to be
a human being you don't study to learn to love but at the end how is it that the deepest emotion and the most complete no
it's difficult to explain them
but but one says that it's good that i had them because i would not have liked to miss it
a lot of energy that's right
aha
yes yes in truth and she for example because because she's very mischievous
yes yes yes
that's how it is yes yes yes
and this and then you understand a lot why eh they are like that and everything that is going to allow them to achieve a strong character and very active no
that is the very best i'm a mother
she is going to achieve many things i think
yes with with all the difficult things that are ahead challenges
no i have a daughter the younger one who is a little like that and she is in addition to being very good with school stuff well she is an excellent athlete
her character to be able also
like to guide no mm
and that they get tired
yes yes yes they need to get tired what a crazy thing
where do you live
oh philadelphia my daughter is attending the university of pensylvania in philadelphia
yes sure its in philadelphia
and maybe yes if i wanted to think what's the best that ever happened in my life maybe that is have had my children i remember that in the very moment i was birthing them i said this is the best that ever happened in my whole life then i want to
yes sure
yes but she will do it for sure what did you study
aha aha
mhm mhm
well that's a good decision
i support it you need to take a lot of vitamines to have all the energy necessary
and you will see in some time my little daughter was fifteen yesterday
and then when you look backwards you'll have much more memories much more experiences of all her achievements which are also yours because
they achieve things thanks to the support they parents can give them and their devotion not like you say as you are leaving aside
maybe your more personal things your career your profession
i want to be consistent say with that comment that i made myself up in the very moment it was happening but however there are other
marvelous things and maybe only one can't be selected true
yes yes yes then i would not have liked it
my name is mariza
yes
yes and if not then the children the children
yes
no
clearly
clearly the death of a family or a loved one has to be one of the worst that can happen to anyone
that too
clear as the second part of the question was that that's been had most of your life that no it had not occurred the negative or painful echo
or would not that person would now still in my case my mom lives but my my grandparents both died long ago
and had no chance to say goodbye to them or because they lived far away then maybe the series would have been if my life would have been different had it not because of course they could not meet my husband or my daughter either
hello
then it is yes
sure life would be so different
here in the united states almost by chance
and yes i'm spanish
and i came here to study but i met him and i ended up staying and i've been here for twelve years
and nothing i have a five year old daughter i couldn't say my life has changed sure because children change your life but she's so little she has so much future
and then nothing i don't know it's different when children are older they are more independent but i still have to go through that
and right
yeah the yeah everybody tells me the same
yeah
yes it also took me effort to think what was the best and what the worst
well i think that as you said having having children well i have only one and i don't think i don't now if i'll have more
it was i mean i don't think i was ready to be a mother maybe because it was a very big change and the pregnancy was very difficult
we we've raised her my husband and i here all alone then it was a little difficult but sure having a child changes your life so it's the best thing that happened to me i say
by now
eh it can't compare to anything else i say
sure
sure and that's why the other question was what would have been different if that didn't happen and i think that if i wasn't a mother my life would be very different
i might have finished school i might have
sure i might have gotten a more important career or traveled more or met someone else but of course you never know you can only imagine
yes but
exactly with so much eh with so mu i don't know as time goes on there are more memories i don't know i wouldn't know which one to choose to begin with
oh
exactly yes all the pictures i have thousands and thousands are all of my daughter that's why the
it's easy to say that it's the most important eh because apart from that it's clear apart from that well i don't know i have traveled a lot i have met interesting people but i don't know how to compare with
with children i suppose
no
yes as i say to my sister that she doesn't have any children and i tell her until you become a mom you won't know how to be a woman let's just say
complete because they have they've been married twenty years but no she doesn't have any kids i don't don't thing that they will have any and then it's hard to explain
it's very difficult to explain because one is not as they say
yes i had him for that reason i say i turned thirty years old and i say well now i think that it's time to or now or or or we have one now or when i'm older i don't want to have it because
sure to raise a child you need to have a lot of patience a lot of energy and a lot of
for example the best
of everything yes yes and my daughter is eh she does require a lot of patience and a lot of sacrifice
and
she's very active very hyperactive and eh i don't know she's not a girl like i was when i was little that i was quieter and i did everything my parents told me she's not she's more
shes like like three sometimes it's
i finish tired after every day but well she is like that she is like that you have to accept children as they are
and
yes i think that or i hope that she
yes yes when i compare with my niece they are so different i think my daughter i don't know she has a stronger character maybe that will help her in the future to move forward
of course
exactly yes that is what we want we want that my daughter also do some sort of sport but we want to wait until she is a little older because she is five i don't know maybe she is too young but
yes me too
she has the body let's say to be an athlete and maybe that will help her to develop more and
yes
and and maybe she calms down
yes yes i need that because sometimes we go to sleep before her we can't like that anymore yes
i don't know there is they tell me it is the age
right now in philadelphia
oh what a coincidence that's a good college
yeah this is a town where lots of people come to study many young people its one of the most important ones and that's also important education
oh yes
of course i would like my daughter to go to the university but that will be many years from now
of course
me criminal justice well psychology but i didn't finish my studies
afterwards i got pregnant the girl we want to raise her at home we don't want to take her to a daycare because we want to i don't know it's the traditional way like i was grown up my parents kept me home
we don't want to leave her alone at a daycare
yes it's good
yes as long as you can right now yes
wow
yes
sure that is what i was thinking and also i was wondering if that never happened how different your life would have been in your case if you wouldn't have had children
is is
hello my name is juan
well hmm pay attention that i have not aha i have not paid much attention to those to those classifications
i end up no understanding them very well either
i think that they are ehm a little complex better yet they should have a little more information of what is it that they have
no btu in general since i don't have small children anymore
ehm children well i don't worry much
by those classifications i worry more in every case for when are we going to see a movie that is a movie that is worth it that has something interesting and not go to any movie then the classification
it doesn't interest much like the quality and the comments that i listen about the movies no
that is that is what calls my attention a little more it is i don't know if the same would to you you always go with you go alone or go with someone
aha
aha
my pleasure as well where are you
ha
oh yes
yes
oh
ha
yes
yes
there's always something
yes that has nothing to do with it yes
yes yes i believe in that sense you can be very right
ah where are you
pay attention to me because curiously
that which worries me the most in movies is the language and violence
regularly because like you say when there is an exaggeration en the language
or in the violence then everything else is the same
so when the movie is like this rated r well obviously it is going to have all kinds of scenes
those are free so rather rated r seems more than restrictions it seems like if you don't have much information about the movie it is exaggerated in all its elements
yes
mhm
yes because that
remembering the movies we have seen recently
aha
pg13 or similar i don't know where he got it because the ones we have here
available at the cinema are not
are not good
then we get worried a lot about the information and my children are teens now and we always go the movies together but
we go primary because the quality of the movies then
it that way the classifications they have to orientate us well it doesn't provide real information they don't
we don't care about i
yes
aha
yes no eh
ah ok i am in texas in san antonio
that
yes
listen yeah in that case when we for the children's education
we have never made act censorship actions we
what we have tried is that when there are strong scenes we try to comment on them no
we talk about them and decide if ti was well regularly it's when we worry and we say listen it was not necessary there's no point in having used such ugly language
no we we analyze and then we take use it as part of our children's education
in general it works very well because or should i say it worked because they're all grown up now
and what happens at this point is that he has very good judgement about movies and
yeah
aha there we are mmh
yeah
yes
yeah
yes
sure
yes and they will find something like that on the way they're always going to have a chance to see all that
but what what we are speaking about in these questions is that censure or the information that that supposedly should be censured
these types of things for i've never thought have been good because
well there is a lot of information about the movies that it's convenient to go see with the family
and after the movie to talk about what happened and educate in turn about what type of movie the message the quality in which it was said etcetera etcetera
no yes
because the restrictions that they place well like you said there is a lot of violence in the cartoon
there is cartoons that are for all children and there are some that have exaggerated violence
yes exactly and in general i think that eighty percent of the movies are so bad that they shouldn't be seen
yes and the others well at least some are in the middle and some less than fifty percent are worth seeing
no well with those there is enough to have an idea of what there is to search for no
yes there is enough i don't want to say that there isn't enough movies but there are so many that we don't have to see all of them it's it's
no and then
if we got to know for example of who they before going to see a movie
over that girl in the movie and over it then we go
is not that is what we always try that we see the movie
aha
we already made a decision over what movies and from my sons had from early they had that education because we like going see a movie to a cinema then
never even when they were like smaller
if we had some movie sometimes we took the with us even if it was for adult only no
and yes they could see some scenes not too strong but the scene doesn't make the movie necesarily
then we tried talking about the message for example not too many war movies no
lots of was movie for example are respecting the soldier
aha ah
well my name is claudia ivette with whom do i have the pleasure
more like that they are the pg the pg than the pg thirteen i have noticed
then well i don't understand much about that
aha
aha
yes yes it is true
aha
aha
aha
aha
no i am married i have been married for three years and to tell you the truth i do have a child he is twenty months old
oh nice to meet you juan
then he barely is going to be two years old and yes the truth that worries me what we do well my husband more than anything
he for example if we see some movie and we really love it we like the movie for example if it is_pg or pg thirteen
this is what we see the most we don't really like it we dont like adult movies
so pg thirteen
maybe once in a while rated r but it actually doesn't get my attention for example if there is one we like
we buy it and it has for example naked scenes of people and my husband hates that so he skips that part
so he does it so he can show us that we shouldn't watch that stuff cause the kids could grab the movie and watch it themselves
and then my husband would film a commercial or something like that
so really there could be a movie about cars or action
but for example he skips it he skips the pornographic part because there is always a naked person in every good movie
from where what
and sometimes there's nothing to watch
we have action movied about cars and out of nowhere there's a scene that has nothing to do with it
so that's what he does cause we are going to have more kids so when they're alone we can be ok and relaxed cause they wont watch those movies
there won't be a problem but
yes
yes
yes because in reality
yes
yes
no yes
eh i am here in the state of idaho
yes y apart for example we have found movies that are this for kids or in other words are not from kids but to see are
passing from the rating for kids which is of course pg13 which is for kids that are thirteen years old that they can watch but sometimes they says like you say vocabulary and sometimes scenes occur
of nudity and stuff so i say good
i don't know i am mexican
this and really there for example television still takes some care and even in the movies they the care themselves a little bit
but i think well i don't know it becomes really
really fast
yes
yes
yes
this is a place called robert this and you where are you speaking from
yes
yes
sometimes they don't tell you anything because sometimes it tells you
and changes your things and when you're watching well it's different what is saying
oh yes for example she says that it's not too violent at times it's not too violent simply not sometimes she doesn't doesn't really give the information
so sometimes not
and one doesn't even pay attention better because because no and those for example
those am things that they sell for example to sell on the television devises that that already see that this
that take out the swear words or things like that and sometimes they don't work but sometimes they don't don't work very well let's say i rea well i really don't have one
but i have a friend that has one and really she says that it hasn't hasn't worked very well because sometimes it blocks swear words that ah words that are not so rude and it leaves swear words
wow a little far
so uf
aha
yes
yes
yes yes
yes
yes
yes that's true that's a better idea i remember that my mom when we watched a movie we didn't see a movie after 10 pm because
we knew what we could find
or my mom would take the risk of finding an ugly movie
yes yes well you see that they have placed us you see that we have the subject of movies
the kind that's not suitable for children but for example sometimes she said i don't know they were showing a movie and it had one or two curse words
or something else that's no so much about nudity but just the same little clothing for example and when we were little for example my mom
no daughter soon you'll understand better she said
because if you say no turn around no no you must not see that then a teenager or a kid will start thinking ah but why won't mom let me see that
if it's a movie in the house and i'm going to watch it why didn't mom didn't mom let me see that part
then i think not yes yes
yes
no i think what
yes
yes yes that is true
well i have i those ratings i don't i don't understand very well i know that there are movies that are pg thirteen pg
yes
and yes and that is in plain day the truth
yes ya ya no
yes
yes
yes that
that too
aha
yes
aha
and the truth is that i have seen some that really have more curse words that are pg three eh eh they are more like more violent and more
aha
yes
aha
aha
yes
good good evening i am jose
always here paying attention of what they watch in i don't want her to watch programs that eh that would give her nightmares or bad ah motivations but there are many
many permissive things too in the fore example the movies outside well more and more they are i now think that it's more violent i don't know if
it's enough to rate it because they're making very violent movies about many subjects
yes
sure
sure
like that movie that's the one about the war in iraq that i think it's about soldiers that the experience they're going through
with that africanamerican actor jamie what'shisname i think jamie foxx
and then you have this other white kid who is traumatized or something when he's in his experience and in irak those things are very real they happen everyday over there
yes true
joe
yes
yes transferring many things outside the lie he said to invade irak that's really uh now that you look at it it really is not
it wasn't worth it doing that more than two thousand soldiers have died during all that
yes it is true
yes it is true well i i think that the thing about the classifications nowadays is very relative i know that they have from thirteen they know clearly that the x are
obvious right but ehm i think that the r or those days it is very stretched what is allowed or not ehm ehm i agree that
many movies right that don't make any sense for example there are many movies about gang members that that the gang members many gang members are the ones that go to see it because since
need to see the violence
yes they are very bad
and like it glorifies in a certain way
yes and what's your name
and that is not to sell to
yes that is why i see sometimes young kids like that replicating the way in which the dress or or how the walk or how they express themselves or ho because those are their hero
and that is not right that ehm corrupts youth those programs those movies teach fa false values and and that is not right but also
the society the parents the family has a lot to do in helping the children to understand those things and and how to send them right and i with my daughter i do not when
i am watching something yes i don't want her to see something i no eh and that is i do not force it in a way saye saying okay do not watch that
or rather that i try to teach her in an educative manner because it's not good for her to be this program instead of forcing it upon her in other words
mhm
oh yes
yes it's easy to
yes
alex where are you from
yes exactly well in in my case i have basic cable and it's like there's no channel that would pass my test
i don't no my girl's only fine years old
well eh it has or rather there's a disney channel that she loves to watch and also we watch the discovery channel that she likes and there's others
a comedy show that if we're not somewhere else we both sit down to watch it together and she really likes to laugh she likes the funny shows
but when there are things a little bit more mature or they get a little bit more risque well i didn't let her watch it because i don't want that she should learn about such undesirable things
that's what they doing entertaining when it's it's not eh so morally correct or wh or socially correct
yes e
the culture is more
the videos
yes all those things
oh yes yes yes of course i remember i remem
yes
yes
teenagers are in a critical age
exactly
it's a way of reasoning and thinking that's what they say we were teenagers too i remember that i used to be like that too
that i was a rebel and all those things but that's when one needs to guide parents
yes and one comes to see when they are alone with their little friends they can see whatever they want since nobody is prohibiting that
eh but if one helps providing a good argument in in a tale of what is good and what is bad that helps to think a lot before acting
making incorrect action
exactly
eh what a memory yes i remember of course
yes
and they believe they are more independent that they don't need parents
yes
yes the influence of the young people today is very big and i agree despite remembering that i also have my influence as a friend when when i was young and that
but i can see why the technology and all that is even bigger because the movies when i was young were not as violent as they are now
there were no video games the televison used to be much more restricted no the did not teach this modern violence not the blood or de body like c s or i and all the programs are picturesque classic
they teach things like they are reality
well it's like that for the youth they become mentally accustomed to that being acceptable but back when i was growing up if they would have shown those things it would have caused an uproar
in fact they wouldn't have even permitted it at all but it's true that people's attitudes are changing and that that's why the youth have such an immense influence
big and negative for all of thee things that society permits and i well
i am from colorado ah denver colorado
i i hope that when my girl becomes a a teenager well that i
oh yeah i know it goes by so fast
i remember when i was a baby and now she's causing trouble and running around all over and learning all sorts of new things and is curious and questioning
well and what do you think about tonight's topic
yes me too i don't pay much attention to the classification apart from an adult grading no of course because i have a girl that
yes good evening
yes no i i think that i'm interested in in movies and tv through the subject that that they broach
now if it's a violent subject and it doesn't have quality it's not a good movie but if it has some violence and and it's teaching us something
like a documentary or something from real life then it has value
because you can not deny the truth of life
you can not live your life with blind eyes
yes
and those movies can also be political criticisms
the bush administration it's always been an administration that's obsessed with war
with irak and deceiving the public
t th those movies are important because the majority of the people are ignorant on the things that happened to the peo in life
what's your name
because there is no information
the information that that we obtain everything is propaganda so it is important to see other versions of what is going on in the world not just the bush's administration version
hmm
those movies are bad
because they teach violence
yes and and they do it above all not for value they do it to sell
to certain people
uh i i also have a fourteen year old son
and every time that he comes to visit me i have to lock the sex channels
yes because he is obsessed with that because when i leave i go to work and he sees that
joe
so well then i have blocked him so that he's not able to do it because i have it all control but i have to control it because i took the initiative to control him
and not according to the censor labels it's job each father and mother to make sure the television that the children are going to watch is protected and not just to blame the censor categories
do you have teenagers
ah yes a little girl
yes you can teach the children but the the the truth is that a parent also shouldn't ignore especially when
they are going to grow up and have the opportunity to be tempted by a lot of things we never had
it's not because we are good parents but because of the culture
nowadays the culture that the teenagers have is like gangs hiphop music lots of sex lots of violence
the videos
ah it's not easy to try and control all that you can try i try to explain him what the consequences of doing these things are
alex
and if he goes and have sex with this girl well this are the consequences this can happen to you do you understand
you have to talk to them often because i've seen so many things i'm a substitute teacher
and lots of parents take good care of their children when they are five six seven eight nine ten years old but then when they are getting older they need more help and parents
they start to make lots of mistakes then and the teenagers are tempted and
that's the time when they have to be involved in their teenager's life
and not only when they are five or six years old
e exactly exactly then everything depends on the parent's education and the way how they are involved in the life of the youngster no not to the not to the classifications
the classification is only a number
yes
we should give foundations to the young what is good and what is bad not only when they are five or six years old but also when they are fifteen sixteen eighteen years old
ah eh i'm here in los angeles i think we spoke before about religion
and it is more important when they are fifteen years old than when they are five because when they are five they are going to follow easy rules
but when they are fourteen or fifteen years old the story is other my friend
already already have freinds already already are involved in culture
the father or the mother have to work not always tehy have the time it is very difficult
mhm
yes
it'll be so soon friend
time flies
we spoke on october the fourth a long time ago
where are you from again
oh yes yes
ah i i watch television through through quality not not classifications
hi marisa this is carolina from here los angeles
it's hard it's
that subject i was dying and saying
why why
but that's fine thank god you are not alone i've heard what people say they don't speak but they rant about him and i say
truly finally the people are finding out except that
they think that people are dumb and it will not happen
it tells of the atrocities they are doing for god's sake
of course
of course look yes and you know that a little bit ago here the film festival ended and latin american
and of course they showed a movie eh this argentinean but the directors were spaniards
and then very interesting because you know that spanish cinema also has many movies this of protest a move of
strong and even i don't know if you by any chance have umm knowledge of a page that's called eh tv for all
kind of documentary this where
and there you can see the television channels from
all the countries in the world including of course spain
aha it's called like this t v pu eh t eh t v a four
aha a four and all a l l like television for all something like that
eh there you can watch well and we coincidentally eh we've been watching eh a private channel from venezuela
and it's of course a state channel but but now really from the state not like before it was of the state but as if it wasn't
and then now we can eh really see the truth what is going on eh what was never said and specially with our president who is a person really
as we say it in venezuela bright
oh we well it's good afternoon over here
eh i don't know if you've had a chance to hear him on some occasion
exactly exactly the
aha same here
same here
but you know that those people regrettably well no i mean they show whatever suits them me
exactly exactly
right right and they show even well sometimes they twist the facts
they twist the facts about what's happening and then i always find po with people that for example tell me good heavens and what do you think about the mad man that you have for president and
i go oh my mother they touch my sensitive spot well the truth is that i completely agree with that mad man ah well what i was
wanted to tell you was that after they've said a bunch of outrageous stuff no
well i was thinking dear mother how can it be hey we got a very difficult subject today
and i go oh my god give me patience lord because it's a supremely delicate subject
i have even had a several problems here eh with even with with venezuelans
eh people that have been here many years and that don't know what is really happening in venezuela
and besides that they're afraid of the idea they've been sold communism and i don't know what about fidel and this and that
well i really don't know how how much you know but uh for example the situation we're living in venezuela is a very special situation
very specific of venezuela i mean it doesn't have anything to do with the cuban reality with what happened in cuba like they
they had to adopt that system eh what were the needs that made them adopt that system and and what happened during the time they
hmm they were applying that because evidently there were mistakes as they are in everything as we have mistakes now too
we've been making mistakes however well we're working on that as the president says well clearly he has a report against
the government not against the country but against the government here who are the
oh dear mother because i am from venezuela
they assume a policy as they see fit as they see fit arbitrarily
exactly
exactly right i mean and if you don't then i'll blackmail you
aha then wow eh
exactly exactly it's a very
due the things i've seen i think that america is somehow awakening
that there are more people noticing what is happening because it is like they were inside a bubble
yes
right
right
where are you from
um bad labels
right
right that what they say to me sometimes what are you doing here
i say look if i could be in venezuela and not to be with the president like the fact that you are in a
country or no like if you left your country that doesn't mean you have a political position
no one knows the reason why people is here
in uh at any given time but that has nothing to do with the opposition because for example how many venezuelan people don't live in venezuela and what they're doing it's bashing
the people and the venezuelan government
i mean that you don't have to be here or there to be supportive or to not be supportive i mean that position is very uh i when they tell me that i laugh a lot
because why are you here and well maybe you would do the same thank god that you're here not in venezuela
oh okay
right right no look the whole problem is the gas that's been really but look
outstandingly high that people can not uh they don't protest i say oh my god but what's wrong with these people i mean
you're supposed to you react when it's affecting your pocket but it seems like it isn't i don't know what's going on or or they change cars and buy more economic one i don't know
i don't know what's going on but they don't have i mean generally they don't have the need to protest about some things
how ever i tell you i don't know suddenly here are you in in pennsylvania you told me
in philadelphia i don't know but here i have felt that there is more it's like the people are just waking up
i feel like they are rejecting of the the actual president and and like they are seeing that the things are not being painted to him because
me too me at first that there wasn't i didn't have access to that that website i said my god is it true about they are saying about venezuela but i talked with my friends
and they said no girl what is that look jeez seriously but look the power of tv is
very big well talking precisely about the subject the power
and and you know that we're living a critical moment right now specifically with the united states and the our new president
and the tv is powerful
of course
correct
yes yes yes yes
of course of course and what are you doing there in philadelphia
okay
oh and you think is better than miami
okay okay
of course of course and we went here how are you
okay okay
and then oh dear mother
okay everything that appears of course
but how long you're in the united states
twelve
oh my god i been here for six years and i want to go back if god allows us
yes of course
yes sir yes sir and
yes
oh my god
yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes and look that i also fell before a little in that and now i understand that is not like that is like us because we don't have
wow
guilt of our what our government does
then before i also see to americans like the gringos now i understand that no they are americans that are from usa because that is another wrong concept that is handles isn't then
well we also are americans if the case we go
and then when after that it starts to reflect a little and no no they aren't americas is the government policy that well what they do is
they decide do then sure is reflecting against the people against the country
but it doesn't like that is the state is te policy of the government
sue
sure sure yes no and you have precisely one have the right because of being in a democracy we have the right to protest
i ah exactly exactly no i i wish that this is is
it doesn't affect the linguistic project in any way but is fine at least it is a very controversial subject when i heard of it
hi my name is marisa from philadelphia
about the the thing about the united states really is that
yes
mm
she is very happ
no
ah yes
t v for all oh
oh
mhm
mhm
mhm
well i think that yes yes on television and of after what ah mm ah mm the summit of the americas and everything that's happening there
hi good evening
yes yes they show it here in in philadelphia a ch there are several of the usual hispanic channels like telemundo univision
galavision and all that
and you hear everything yes and
it's not like and here too here everything is controlled by the government i mean let's say
eh we only hear what no what they want us to hear
mhm
mm
yes
mm
yes
whoa it's true it's three hours less there yes
hmm
sure yes
sure
yes i mean they've become as the question says the world's police they think they are
the bosses of everything and they tell you what's going to happen and if you don't agree then they do it the hard way you you have to agree
hmm exactly
with an embargo with with anything or even harder with violence ay with war
um
mhm
it is still a long way and that is what makes me more
very difficult indeed
it makes me angry because it is clear if you know two plus two equals four and you see how people have been manipulated
when you try to say something to the other person look things are like this don't you see then they say no because you are
liberal or communist it's like they
you put labels on yourself
bad bad lables if you are not a terrorist or are anti anti go away we do not want you here if you do not like
and i say but if um this isn't a bad country are it's leaders
yes
uh um
right
um
ahem
yeah
no but the it's also the same in spain the thing it's that it's diff it's different the left wing government but even if it was rightwing that's a a different mindset because the
people when they don't agree they go to the streets and and they do protests and you never see that around here i have never seen that
oh um
yeah
yeah
yeah in philadelphia yes
mm
yes
the power yes
i am from spain
yes they are the ones who control it i mean here
eh philadelphia is a democrat city everybody in the world are democrats but the rest of the state is republican and of people of gringa of the town that say those things
i don't know very very ra very radicals
very religious very closed minded o yeah so
no can't he won't change so while it doesn't change well
me well with my husband here mm we moved here in one year ago we used to live in florida and ah
here searching for a job we just moved
we are in the process well i liked most what happens is that the question of work is better here in the north the south is heavily congested
and wath we shall do job is first
he works in the pharmaceutical industry doing clinical research
well
and i working as administrative and volunteering
what i found of course
twelve years
mhm
when i arrive bill clinton was the president and the country was in a incredible stage of works everybody was happy the economy was going up
then arribe the republicans with bush and everithing went down as you say
this can be little by little is this i don't know the world spain is already
when i'm going to spain all in the world to the to my husband that is american he looks bad and says to me and he has a lot resentment because he says look your country
is broken the world is seizing of all and
believe that that yes that believe that are the you know the owners of all and
yes
and is resentment of power
sure
ajá
sure
mhm
yes i don't like it i am i am spanish and i am american i here is the need and is like the taste but to me is
eh and must stand and must endure all that the government is doing but i don't even know i don't like it it is a
surefine but in practical field don't even say a thing unless
mm is like a regime yes
very
yeah well and well something similar is happening to me too and what i can say about the united states is not very positive either because because i'm not leftwing either anyways then well
me
i must say i will speak about bush because i am so so angry i must speak to bush and i put him in a bad spot because
yes yes yes
that it is
uhm
no atrocities and then later and and everyone throws their hands over their heads my god this can not be i don't know why
and no the next week they forget the issue because
the press and tv well they go to another thing let's say to to to distract something to distract then people forget
mm
mm
mercedes is speaking
mhm
and was there a time when you had a break up that was difficult
yes
it's difficult always
mm
mhm
how great
or you'll only know that when you have had two boyfriends
how great the best but for what if you have trouble you get trouble
when it is not necessary
from honduras
then to see also if i took so long that eh no way around it but i don't believe i had any difficult experience at all we'll see i believe so
i went out with a friend ah yes with the first boyfriend that i had that i went out with for two years
yeah i remember that we had decided that already i don't remember precisely why we were going to break things off
because of this it took ten years
i took 19 18 ago
yes
and afterward we well we stopped seeing each other after that was not so difficult because we were apart i mean he lived on one side and i on another
after with another guy whom i was with we were also together a few months he also didn't live where i where
we were in the university where we were and he returned to his country of origin
and that one was also easy by the fact that one stops seeing him and quick i mean it's easy well right
mhm
in that manner
uh what else let's see what else after that i didn't have any other official boyfriend until s more than yes truly the experiences that i never had in some manne experience like i don't even know right thank god
mhm
mhm
yes
right
yes
mhm
thank god
you say that it's nothing then everything can be perfect it's right always and also
ah from where
because there are people that make mistakes there are people that think that ay that the marriage is the eh it's according to the time of ah and all tranquility
but and one lives with the people day and night and sees it the ge that is
it's impossible then that they maintain a right a situation that way of that ay
yes one always loves the person but it's impossible that it's only is peace then that is what i'm saying right
because one well i i am one a human and one has to things that very bother other people you know and
see to any other persons well i'm not saying the person that one is with in particular but any other person well i know that
eventually well we have a saying it is not the money of the world all day 24 hours day for the rest of your life well
yes
yes
and to try
ah that is good
yes yes
mmh
yes
oh no yea that and what it is its ironic i mean its just that its usually sometimes there are times that those relationships are very hard
for that for people that are living to close to those kind of relationships
because its usually the people when osmeone is in that situation there's like low autoconfidence
and then they think that the people think that this is good what i'm going to reach in the near future
i had to wait i just have to keep on waiting well
so then really its not so easy one thinks that oh well he did this i would send him to hell no
its hard i mean because it turns into something like not to say addict but that kind of situation where
and you where are you from
the drama is well a lot right so then the people don't know how to go out and move on right that happens
yes but
uh um
oh
uh um
uh
oh no
ah from where the city eh capitol
what do you think of today's topic that it is easier to break up with someone young or do age make a difference
yeah
well my name is ibet with whom do i have the pleasure
i feel that is difficult when you really love the person when you don't really love is like any other thing okay fine is over okay
each one their own way
and so i believe that when you really care about a person in that case i imagine that it is because you do not get along well with that person
o o because really i don't know maybe it is because they tried to get along between the two people and i think that it is that more than nothing
a communication between relations
well in between relations and yes there isn't one one of the two parts begins to lose the descon there will be a lose of trust and begins
to deteriorate the communication and so i believe that that can cause a tear but yes i think that hurts
mm well in reality yes yes yes because for example before i got married with my husband i was with a person for example eh
like so but it wasn't for a long time but the first my first boyfriend
and so this
hello mercedes how are you where are you from mercedes
i was with him a short time it wasn't much but the first illusion that i had i don't know and and i was there and i had said well and i said that well with that one i will get married
eh i'm going to have three children i was placing my castles in the sky and when he came and said you know what here no here it ends
what
i think that he had experience saying here it ends and so i think that for him uhmm
it wasn't as difficult as it was for me
and so now i know that everything was for the best because after that i met my husband and it was for the best
the truth
therefore i don't know
so it is and
and what about you
oh from honduras
yes and what's happening with you
i see
i see
i see
wow
you are married now
oh
uh huh uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
wow i have a sister in law that she is from honduras
yes
yes
uh huh no yeah it's just that sometimes i don't know well for example i believe that in in my case uh with the first person i think that i grew way too fond of him
well it was too much
more than what than what uh he grew fond i think of me and it wasn't very much time i think they were like two or three months
but at the same time i was flying because they said ah this is my first boyfriend and and will probably marry him and things like that
and in and he and i think that that he didn't think of it like that he said well she i don't know if i was his third fourth fifth i don't know
but said yes then i'n not going to marry her i'm going to go with her and i'm going to get to know her and and up to there in return then i think i was the one that built my hopes up for that
and this yes yes it hurts the truth
eh yes it hurts because i think that you are excited and you have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and tells you no then now
ay no don't eh know but i know that she is also honduran
but i think that it must it must hurt much more when you are already living together with the person as in marriage
i think that it has to be the worst experience i think of your life it's yes and i hope i hope it never happens because we don't know right
then i hope it never happens even right now i have three years of marriage and everything is working then not wonderfully but everything is fine
a lot of communication and things like that
yes
no
yes
no yes
yes
yes
yes is
that's the way it is
yes the truth i think that it is something of the truth it is very difficult to maintain the appearance that everything is happy fine you know but
and i think also that and i also think that um when you have your relationship you can know and as such when you start know the person
that really you won't know her very depths you know until you are married to that person but that but that i think that i think that
if you see that in reality you don't get along with that person and for example i have known people who have hit their girlfriends when they were boyfriend/girlfriend he would hit and treat them poorly and would obligate them to do what he wanted later
i think those relationships well they will never go anywhere good because if they haven't gotten married yet
and they already treat them like imagine how it will be when they are married no but a little bit later they will say you are my owner and in that way
and how they treat you i think that those relationships um i think that they will not work i don't know or or he changes or
or changes or that kind of relationship is over i think that if there was a relationship like that well i i think that it would not hurt at all on the contrary
one should rest if one has a boyfriend that hits you or that
i am from mexico
you are going to rest you will say oh its good that we're done i don't know everything will be good and stuff
everything will be great and then somebody i don't know has to go for example to a different country or a different school i think it would hurt a little bit
because everything was good for certain circumstances i mean you don't have to separate so i think those kind of relationships well hurt its a kind of relationship that
that you get hurt and stuff so yeah
that's right
ha
yes
that's right
that's right your right because
for example i ones in the state of mexico met a girl that um that came with black glasses to work
from the city yes mexico cityyes and
and i told he what's with the glasses it was well the day was cloudy right and she had a bruise because her boyfriend hit her
and i told her you know i told her i think you shouldn't let i don't know i told her but i think you shouldn't let your touch you
your boyfriend because and she said  well it's just that it very it's very hard to me to break up with him and told her  why  and she said
in spite of everything i love him
and then wow i told her what how can you possible love someone that hits you that hurts you sometimes she came uh bruised or sometimes
that he slapped her or stuff like that
then like you said sometimes those kind of relationships are the toughest and when she finally did it i remember she was the one that cried and cried and cried every
every time she could she cried during breaks and stuff like that because she missed him and all that so i think so in a way sometimes uh
some relationship i think that well i imagine it was very painful to her
mn look well i already went thru that phase and i am now married but for example ah mmwell don't knowthe experience that i had was very difficult
fabiola
yes i know a few people from maracaibo
eh yes yes
look and you are you arepa
yes
heck a venezuelan girl and in houston
no no no no not in houston in
texas no no i work at home my home
do you work
oh
what a good job
well and you
si but eh it's gives you satisfaction
to help people
there i learned
i learned yes yes
but by signals
oh my daughter taught me the alphabet here some words
not all
yes little words
but cute
and talk
in washington yes
without listening but that they talk that they do
ah
how great
what a big job for the parents
and what do you think about about the subject they gave us today about
yes of course i think that sometime more than love and all that because love in any case
you acquire it through time
and and with with enthusiasm so i believe that you want to maintain a family you have to want to maintain a family because there's a lot of people who loves you
and they're so young that the first thing that they can think of when they have a chance is fight split
they don't work hard and they love each other they love each other maybe even more than a couple that's been married for thirty years
and you
but they fight every day and overcome trouble they get over their problems
and i think that's what's needed um people these days they should be patient and
think that if they choose to stay with that partner or marry that partner
well that's forever even if there's trouble not run out at the first problem you found
and me twelve
yes
me too
it would mean nothing but
ah that is what i say if i fall i stand up again what is the problem
but now i think about it three times
uf
ah of course i do the same
oh my god
i have not gone through that i have never reach that level
it was pride
yeah and it was pointless
it only affects
sweet spot is like being ready to throw in the towel
right
really
ummm no it's a girl and sometimes they treat each other well but they don't love each other
extremes
they're they spend their whole life together
no there is respect and
and what they wanted to form was a family
no there are some that mention love if there is no love there is nothing
because of course no one tells you to do it you want to be there you have to keep on going
you could have a partner its dificult and when you have each other you have to
the most dificult is to keep it with you
but no when time comes you would know it but the most important thing is to learn how to get out of the daily rutin
and the system leads you to that
no he is from here
chilean
it's so easy i say
well for certain things it's easier
for certain
yes i think it's easier for me because sometimes the the are very fun because i do not understand what he says and says it played then it goes well did not have a point to fight
much with it because it makes me laugh
what did you say or when we are super b
eh chilean from chillán
from maracaibo
carolina
no you know know why do you know people from there
oh yeah yeah well you know that they have a very strong accent no something like look and you mn
aha
ah yes yes yes good goodbecause sometimes is so difficult to find venezuelan people and they say no no we really know few venezuelans this and that and i say oh my gd
we are few over here really but in a about ten years maybe i think that they have increased
mhm
mhm oh do you work at the hilton
ah i heard you say in the hilton oh my gd oh okay okay
okay okay perfect
yes i work with deaf children
how is it going fabiola how are you mm
aha well now really i am working with the parents of deaf children mhm
listen yes very hard
yes
exactly exactly and
ah ok ok chilean of course no
mhm
mhm correct but here is oral
ok
mhm
mm ok
well well where are you
yes yes yes now im is in the oral part no i'm in the other side of of mm of the mm
of the profession because this is here is encouraged children to talk
mmh
yes no yes because they mm with hearing aids can hear
then what it is done it is that they train their hearing so they can recognize sounds
mmh mmh yes yes that is like a a possibility they have well of being able to speak clearly they will never speak perfectly the you you are going to feel the difference when talking
but definitively they are going to have that option well that even in eh it is/ there are some parents who combine sign language with the oral part no depending on
the degree of hearing loss in in in the child if it is too deep where there are no chances but not even with the best surgery then there
eh they use sign language as a complement
mmh it is a huge job truly it is very very hard but it is very eh rewarding because in the end eh and it has its its reward well of course they have to really put on as we say put on the charger
ay my mother very far
because otherwise mm well hardly well is he going to achieve it well
well you see it is a current topic current current truly i think that couple relationships are not simple at all you have to deal with a person who
who is different from you who comes from another world another culture another way of being and then try to have just one project like
eh sometimes it is a little difficult no but i think that love is the only thing that makes it possible to overcome barriers nothing else
only if there is if there is love and lots of will from from the couple for these these differences and those mm those eh fights that they might have in a given moment
they can overcome what do you think
um
right
um
right
i am in los angeles
sure
right
yeah
right
of course well look i with my husband we have we've been married for almost 8 years now
and twelve imagine that and and we really have had well two critical moments almost splitting and and there was a point where also maturity plays an important role there right
i in another moment of my life i had gone
aha
it would mean nothing nothing look it would have mattered a damn
exactly
yes
of course then now i really think about it and say to myself but he has another qualities then i focus myself in his good things i say he is different from me he can not think as me and i don´t have to get mad if he does not think like me
but do not want to let that to affect me
right whatever exactly then fortunately well eh the first time it was horrible because i thought it was the end of the world and then we were for a long time without talking to each other until a day i say well what is going on
we have we had almost three weeks we had never last three weeks without talking or seeing each other and sleeping in the same bed
hm horrible horrible horrible i told him look you know what it looks to me
hear me not terrible a big tantrum on our part really i told him do you know this looks to me like a big tantrum on our part
we don´t have whatever this doesn´t make sense if you want to continue with this project we will continue if you don´t want to continue we will not continue it i love you
i want you but we can not continue like this because you go by one side and i go to the other one is true believe that i love you and because i love you
is that i need to define thisbecause is foolish of us to live like this besides a place like this is not blessed by god so
let's get going because putting aside how serious the situation might be it fortnately it wasn't too serious but uh seeing as neither of them wanted to twist anyone's arm right
we are in the extremes exactly how great and where are you from
it was foolist pride because that
not at all quite the opposite
exactly so good fortunately we can pick up where we left off and then we had another and neverhteless it was less i think the first one was really what marked us
and it was good well what's more i was just about to as we say here i was just about to hit the sweet spot i said nothing until i got here
yes ready to throw in the towel i said nothing no no no i'm not going to i'm not going to let you do it i said i'm not going to let you that is you're wrong
if i've learned anythink in life it is to look for solutions when we can
because what are we going to do with a mediocre relationship i don't want a mediocre rlationship as you yourself say there are people who spent up to 30 years together and that's a nasty relationship
it's that they treat each other badly this look here this piece of whatchamacallit what what is that what do i want that for
exactly that too
yes yes yes look it's that so many things are happening really so many thinks happen with couples that it's it's a really interesting topic because you say
where from
there really are people that look that seem to have everything going so well but they don't love each together it's like well i've become used to living with him
exactly
exactly there are some that don't want there are some that do wherever they want to keep an image
there is nothing in fact there has to be love a great love i feel that my writing was posible because of the love
in fact everything has to have love to get us out of the difficult situations
it makes no sense to continue something without love i feel that way there needs to be more love and less of that compromise you talked about
to be there because you want and you know it's worth it
exactly exactly
exactly
that is easier yes sir you look for ways to have armony with your partner do different things don´t fall in the daily rutin
oh chilean ok i am from venezuela
hey
of course exactly to recognize it
of course is your husband from chile too
wow i imagine like hey it's a little more i mean not that it is more difficult actually i feel that love can do everything
you think it's easier
oh okay okay because my husband is from venezuela and
and sometimes i say i think that this has nothing to do with the with nationality i think these are universal things
and that that's what i said
bad
how funny
and how did you get there
oh of course from idaho
well my mom married an american
yes for that reason we came and we went to seattle in ninetyone i was about eleven years
and my father stayed in chile and that's why i go and go back like that
of course
yeah
interesting
one like that we are like we live together
so then of course
yes well more or less in the for example i am there the whole two thousand three
yes because or rather i am within the city i like it its more city maybe i am from a city or the country for example i lived in san rafael i don't know if you hears of it but
road from san felipe to los andes which is more like rural and you can't imagine how
typical chilenean country and i love that
like a village i don't know or i like to be in a city i don't know to be more within i don't know there are more things to do
more i don't know what they charge is
so
yes
but
yeah i imagine
of course
and what is it called and of course then would come and go but more less the ninetyone yes and you
of course
yeah i imagine
same in contact its hard aswell
oh it is not so much not at all not at all
and from santiago most probably
sure
am i used to live
sure over there in santiago i lived in the and in concepcion
sure
yes precisely it sounds good
hello
because no i don't know what for i wrote myself on monday to make
and i didn't hear anything until
i mean hello yes
ay i wish it wasn't but this phone works badly sometimes
i was saying that i've been taking calls i don't know
well i started once and they called me four times but i was only able to take one call
yes
okay
yes yes and what can we do if that happens
i say it's been
hello hello how are you
fun they give a subject maybe it's for
no uh yeah that must be it
i thought i thought that it was like this this study to do what's it called telephone menu's and stuff like that
well for hospitals and theaters and stuff like that and so they wanted people to talk about stuff about health and something like that for example
oh because you shouldn't or because you don't want to
oh
oh right oh yeah
oh yeah i thought it was a part of the study that they wanted to listen to words in spanish or in castilian i don't know
no but no
yeah with
oh from idaho very good i'm alicia from atlanta
right like a fruitcake
yes
no no it's that well idaho right
yes i was in in washington near seattle when i had just arrived to the united states sure
and that now i'm in georgia i'm in the south then in well like where the the all are very here and i don't know the band and i'm in atlanta and
go on and more it's placed here
eh but idaho for example is a very rural state like that no
yes i can imagine the same no it depends
ah yes i can imagine oh the thing is that i'm in atlanta and it's a pretty big city supposedly should be fantastic for us you see
two three years
yes
uh well something and all the businesses and all the bars and all the clubs must close at two in the morning go figure
at two in the morning everything closed
well the reason is that the sector in atlanta is called bucks head
and since over two or three years ago there used to be lots of crime and things like that and three people were murdered three people were murdered
so the city had a new major and what do i know so yes people are killing
but it's like it's like a city like this one has to have a
ah you use your car a lot a lot yes
well it's because
sure it's bad because for example i would rather have a good system for the simple fact that it's
expensive and because
fine and you
there's a lot of traffic
so the traffic sucks and i mean you can't get to places on time
yes the car
oh yeah like over there
of course
oh
yeah well
of course of course
oh yeah yeah
yeah
that's good where are you from originally
mm
of course
oh that's good it's the same as claro and they gave him something there be wise of the university of washington
we were latino and
oh prepared and ready to go
mm
ah
oh of course
of course yeah yeah
of course the grain
really me too
no
yeah well it's like what i enjoy is that tons of people they think that i from palestine or somewhere tropical yeah if i walk into some restaurants
like if it's a middle eastern place and they say to me
and they treat me to speak in arabic i don't know they found me the face most of the indian or something loke that but sure and there are discrimitation or not
oh but
ah sure
ah sure
and sure sure
yes yes sure
well here is like good today that atlanta and all the south is like 70 black so
yes
then is like the fact is so much diverse so is like more acceptable that i know but at the same time to the south is the south of the
usa has that history of been one of the places more racist of all america in fact here
it was the slavery and all that then there is a certain minority of white people that hate to any ethnic group and have his own rars demostrations and all that stuff but
of course
yeah but
of course for example in the rural parts of georgia you would see things like in ku klux klan i don't know
yeah you still do
but too see those kinds of things you have to be very far away from the city
its inside the city of atlanta its in a more civilized place so those things don't happen
yeah that's good luck look at what has happened
hello
how long have you been living here
oh okay
mm okay
okay
so then you are single now
oh okay
okay ah look and and what do you call it do you like it or not
oh
yes
oh
oh okay
oh okay
its not like
its not a drastic change me coming over here
because i was used to living in the city right and here its a city and i can find anything i want except there's more life
its a little bit more relaxed
more relaxed that's not good because its not a good example there's not so much crime in the city because its big
but its kind off boring
somewhat
over here is the same but not so much not so much at least small is not so big
i have been living here since the two thousand two
no not that long just a little
yes from santiago
and and you where are you from
from santiago as well
oh okay
look that how small is the world
and have you been here long in this thing of calling over the phone
hello
oh really
hello
ah okay
oh okay
ah you're uh you're calling every day
oh okay
yes yes they called me this week too but i couldn't answer them because
week is been kind of lousy
yes
yes
fine i'm viola from idaho
to talk to have something to talk about
yes i think so
uh
no what's going on is that i was told they give subjects because that why you're not supposed to speak about personal stuff
because you shouldn't like very personal stuff
because you never know about the other person on the phone because
so that's why they give subjects to talk about
oh ok
yeah the only thing they told me is that you had to talk about subjects like subjects without importance but
to have like a subject don't just talk like fishheads
from atlanta
yeah well
right and do you like it here
eh
eh
eh
yes it's like a filed and everything is very very much like a field
yes it's like half and half it's like i don't know it's like night life i don't know
eh
hello at two
oh and why
oh how are you
eh
oh
oh
yes okay but do you have to drive your car a lot or do you use public transportation
we ah it's the same around here you can't go out at two in the morning it's not
if you have a car or something
yes
oh okay
yes
it's completely different here
fine fine
well there are lots of cars people have cars because it's necessary something like that
becuase there is no collective but
they don't take too long like to to go somewhere where the city where i live is like the midle of port santiago and there's a lot less people
cause you know here the houses are bigger they're separated things like that
and i'm not in idaho falls
in idaho falls
and i'm going to a bigger city
there in a bigger city
where we are isn't all land
ah
from chile
here there's plenty just like there are machines like that yes
there is tons of mexican and of course it's a rural area
they hire a bunch of mexicans like that to do the work at
the land and things like that
well almost always what you see are mexicans me included people see and think you're mexican also
except latin they say ah mexican
well you have to go about saying no no no
i'm not mexican
yes
eh
really
uh uh yes is the same but no
i mean yes like everywhere
is the same is most with the people that is latin but they don't know speak a lot but
because are a lot of people for equal that going to buy and don't know anything of
english so then they have to walk to the people you know like in everywhere are mediums
because there are good discriminatory you know that
oh okay
oh
ah but things like strong yes
they fight it hard
oh how nice
not here its nothing massive here its just like something were scared about but not like groups or anything like that
oh yeah that's true
oh mm
uh
uh
oh oh that's weird
oh i married an american
yeah i married an american that's how i got here what about you
oh really
mm
hello oh hi juan marcela
yes
mm
ah
they denied that to you medical attention
mm
yes but i'm sure it's cheaper there
yes that helps my god
yes i don't think that the whole system has to fall so that they change it i think it's going to be quite hard to fix it because there are
lots of expenses lots and it depends on the demand so if those expenses keep on increasing going up going up
because of the demand and because people keep paying those prices so costs go up because people ask for more and more money and then people need more money it's a vicious cycle so how could they possibly create a more social medicine
yes how are you
it is impossible because all those people are like how
money does not stop being like a drug you see they are accustomed to a certain amount of money
and now all of a sudden will not have it
yes of course
let's stop making bombs and going to war look all this money that could be used
in the schools or in a medical system of socialized medicine
mm yes
yes the nurses are paid very well because there are few nurses there are fewer
mm
yes tell me twenty thirty dollars an hour
i think so you are in texas and i am in north carolina
mm
no but the difference is that they started right
yes is like in argentina my parents have all the medicine paid
all the medicine paid they pay a little no but is very little
yes
is is really expensive
in all parts of the world in all parts of the world
yes there was a medicine i was taking my son took for a short time and it turns out here they didn't have the medicine you see generic
eh and then we went to argentina last year i went to the pharmacist and i showed it to him and something that cost here more than fifty dollars
over there i bought if for twelve dollars
yes please to meet you
twelve dollars the same brand and everything
and could have could have been less if i bought from the other brand the unknown brand one thing
but i don't understand
mm
mm
yes yes yes
that's really true that's really true
i mean what do i know according to whatever thing like that
according to the specialty they have to operate over here do you know what you would have to do
why don't you contact an organization that is called the shriners
yes
shriners yes
eh because they help kids
now i don't know if they specialize in a specific disease or if they cover everything because perhaps
you can get in touch with them and tell them listen we have a son and this is his condition and this is our situation
and maybe they can help you in some way because the shriners dedicate themselves to help to pay for the medical care of kids that can not pay
of parents that can not pay
i don't know they say is twelve minutes but their twelve minutes seem more like half and hour
yes maybe i'm wrong but finding out doesn't cost anything
and also if you call catholic charities
maybe they maybe they have i don't know something that can help you in a
oh i am cover on behalf through my husband
mm
of course
mm and of course he is growing and then at best now that medicine doesn't help him they have to give him another
mm
what a thing
and you you must live with your heart in your mouth
and that's a lot of stress
a lot of stress
mm yes yes yes
mm
and the children are covered this way so yes we are fine
of course because on top of it it's embarrassing look how old is he
how old is he
ah of course he's a teenager
yes also do you you know where you can find out in teaching hospitals
from the doctors a the medical centers where there are schools of medicine
a lot of times the different departments
go to people that don't can't pay in the situation as one usually would you see like we how can't go to a specialist because it costs a lot of money
and we don't have it
and then they take them and then the take note of what what they give you and they cover it accordingly something that's always
reasonable something that you'll well be able uh to do sometimes they don't charge anything
is a problem right
monthly and that it is it is this interesting i had to have an abscess done it happens that i have something called add
and i a few years ago thought that i had it but in the end i went and since i had diagnosed myself and at the end i found here in the hospital that teaches the university of north carolina
they didn't charge me anything and they gave me all the tests
yeah
ah yes so that is with the
with the university ah
ah what a thing
mm
they didn't want to give you that information
ay so you probably can
mm we are very healthy but you never know
mm
you probably can now
hi how are you mi name is juan marcela
people in the community right
so they would ask me for papers like my domicile proof of job and finally they found a pretext for denying me for rejecting me
because they asked me to send them a document from the person that was hiring me and then that person refused to give me that paper so
in my case my son has epilepsy
so he needed medical attention things that
eh no no no they refused to inscribe me it's true so i get pretty stressed about that he got really sick once he got quite sick
so i had to go back to mexico so that he would be checked by his regular doctor
and he sent him some medication and when i need more medicine i go buy it in mexico
it's a problem because i need the prescription a friend of mine is a doctor and he gave me some samples
no yes he gave me some so yes it's something that we think should be more flexible right for the community for a certain type of community
listen didn't we speak the other day with
yes yes
yes
yes it should be
uh uh
exactly it's a problem it's a cycle that works with earnings and it is stronger right
so the greed is worse
mm
mm mm well it would go down just a little
with that because here i don't know what it is like where you live but here if anyone has money it's the nurses and the doctors right
so mm and here well like you say you see a good car with a woman who is thirty years old for example no
yes it's it's my pleasure
and she is a nurse and that's what happens when you figure out for sure if they are nurses
yes yes i uh uh well here in this case well that is what is offered in canada i understand well they have a lot of medicine right
so any resident in canada has rights to the medical services for the fact of being there and there are really no major consequences on the economy
and is mm exactly
uh uh
yes yes yes that's the other thing that one can at least try to pay something
will have some sort of insurance but even that is
is expensive no and then i don't know how the medicines here are in mexico they are cheaper and is more like that
and there's more medicine competition over there that for the
uh uh
i have not forgotten we practiced together no yes listen but i am it's time health
yes yes yes
yes
the same yes
and the case of mexico for example my son's medi cine is available in five six brands
with similar ingredients
no yes yes and here there's only one and second that in literature she's not the best and it is hey but only the laboratories i thought that all of the north american laboratories well uh
then at the hour of the competition well there's a monopoly here
super strong interests in everything no
mm
but
do you have social security here are you covered
yes
uh uh oh yes
yes i already know yes i already know
mm
mm
yes
uh uh uh uh well yes look yes
yes i knew about that listen is our time up or what
oh look that yes i only knew about the and thought it was for me and me smaller without getting tired and like that
mm i'm going to crash
oh oh
uh uh uh yes that
yes yes is very simple because in reality well on one side the maintenance is a medicine that this person that helped with the sample said no man this
here they give us you have no problem no more do you see some community center or something and
there are a lot of signs and but knowing a little more about the advances it's that i can give the medicine we think that a stronger diagnosis could improve my son's life with
with the epilepsy no
because it was under control but ultimately now he has about two years that it has been uncontrolled it has been under control
and well he gives it to me gives it to me yes yes they gave him another they increased its effectiveness and he got sick and then well either way he had to stop and go back to the basics
yes yes he got much worse
yes yes then it's that now you know it's a question of experimenting
well yes sometimes yes
oh well imagine that that not us
always yes
life even though you don't say it's always unsettled all the time
no after you know that always you are hoping that it doesn't happen well i don't know what what happens really no but then that trauma but to my poor son because he's a teenager then
it happens in school and then he feels really bad
yes yes it's a stigma it's a stigma what he has no so
seventeen
per se well getting back to the theme i believe that there should be some good ones here
system of uh
uh uh
yes
we are not covered is a problem because well something could always happen right
mm
mm yes
mm
uh uh
uh uh
ah yea
well then everything is pretty good at the orientation that i went to where justifiably it is called university system healthcare system something like that
so justifiably that is where they kicked me out
i told him
mm uh uh therefore they told me i needed to bring them information i had a letter from my admissions etc no
and he yes and just the other day i went to an uhm an office in which supposedly gave a type of or rather pension for
but that isn't we need the social security from your employer so that is when they just didn't want to
no well i don't but well now i have my own social security my own
yes employee
so anyway i'm going
uh uh
hello how are you mi name is juan
then more than than sometimes lets say that it is part of the institution where you are found no is more like a working tool
but a very personal tool seems to the car no
yes yes exactly also because i am here in texas
i feel that car culture here is kind of the way culture was also for horses in the days
no it is like a horse it is something very personal very close
the life we have they take care of them here and it is as important as the horse was in that era
some years ago and well if they do not say in our era of communication the most important elecronics are the ones that have to deal with communication and computer
eh what allows communications and all that no
but
yes
i am in san antonio mateo i think he talked already you are in philadelphia
exactly and here the working people have like in those times a like a mule no need a pick up a truck pick up
pick up truck no and go and give and for it not to leave yoy then it is you can tell like there is a culture for hard work very important
and the computers good well all the houses there is television telephone and computers practically no but but how are there other dimensions no of the technological question then the auto appears to be
of the most important
ah what what tecnological question is technology important in your life what is that we are discussing right now if it had to be the auto or if it had to be the computer what you do you opine
aha exactly
aha
aha
yes yes
you have your cellphone
ah look i ma glad to talk to you again
yes i notice that it is very important what you just said some time ago when i worked i had the type of job in which the computer was the most important no
and well the computer had the messages it always had internet email messaging more than the cellphone no cellphone nothing no
the computer was the most important
but now with the kind of work that i'm doing the car it's the more important than the computer because the car let's me do the work i'm doing
more physical right then the care becomes the most important instrument and the computer well it goes to a second instance but it is also important right
but it's because the kind of work
yes yes
yes that's right
oh really
yes well here yes because the distance you have to drive to work the car is essential
listen fine everything is fine what do you think about today's topic
but also in the city i think and the most import well according to the job it might be the computer right then
the other question the communication electronics right the cellphone and
and then the other question is if you consider that this technologies are more of a problem than of
we what type of problems can you have no as you just said with the car the problems that have to do with parking
no here in texas no there is not where i am there are not many problems no with parking there is a lot of space everywhere no it hasn't presented yet
let's say those problems here but in the end i don't know i don't know what you think more more than anything i would say that well regarding cars car issues and ll that well you don't see a big problem unless that
we considered it like a problem interests created around around the car industry and how they sometimes appear to affect the same development of technology of
of transportation no for example
yes
yes yes yes but yes
the topic is about thecnical devices i mean the technology the most used devices and how much do you depend on them and how you consider the dependency
well
yes
exactly yes but as they also say with the car industry no if the car industry had advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry perhaps cars could transport us with
at one hundred kilometers with just one liter of gas
no and instead of costing twenty thousand dollars they would be costing two thousand dollars
if that's the case no but technology that industry at best has its own interests and it's as if it doesn't advance no you heard what they are saying about the hybrids
i say no many are saying that they are not cost effective and that in reality is a matter of manipulating company image when the times comes for viewing performance tables
i though hybrids cars would be more efficient i think the efficiency they have achieved is minimum
no no i don't think they have a real real that they it is really an important change in technology given its efficency
pardon me
and you consider the tecnology no your daily life if it turns out to be more a problem than a solution or something like that
no no i don't think it is so important at the same time the efficiency they show es radically different than that of other cars it is too little no you see that's what i say
one ah according to the tables an economical car can provide you with thirty six miles per galon
and a hybrid can give you fifty
uhm well
aha
yes that's right sure but at the same time for example these cars the small cars they have the same performance as the hybrid cars and they are not hybrids no
the small cars the new ones that are not yet in the american market that are now in the european or latin america's markets have to be more efficient
and smaller isn't it so if we buy a car at the price of a hybrid car and we compare it against a small european car or to one of those cars of latin american well
it's a lot more expensive to have a car because the initial cost and because you will save money on gas then
it's cheaper that a normal car a good economical car right
is the same that is the same that i was thinking of course it should be included no
european
yes it's like yes
yes i do a few years ago it had something to do with the oil in the eighties or around that time i don't remember
i thought that was going to change that the culture was going to change because they started making smaller cars here in the united states
so i thought oh well the culture is going to change but it didn't it was like a temporal thing because they still have lots of huge cars they still
exactly yes but i said well yes the automobile seems to be the most important no is then i thought maybe is the computer but no
aha exactly but sometimes eh what seems like a more personal element depending on the case then it can be the car no because the computer is now every time more just another tool
hello hi uh mateo
because you have to take care of the car and you know
ah
did you use horses more
yes
yes
yes because in texas yes but even there in texas
you all need a car you know to work
so that
ah yes yes
yeah
yes yes yes and you are
yes but the questions in the topic were which
well for me it would be my computer and cellphone
because you know because i have my cellphone and i am always with it
and well i have become used to having a cellphone you know
before i did not have a cellphone until i became twenty years old but now that i live in philadelphia in the city and that i'm not always at home for
i'm always returning to my house for for you know see my messages
well i am always i am always i always have my cellphone
i think that it is very surprising that almost the whole world has a cellphone here in the united states
yes
yes
yes how have you been
but now
well for me i think that well you're in texas and obviously there are more free land and contryside and
a lot more space
because in the cities having a car can be an inconvenient thing also
because you have to park it and well parking is expensive and you can't find any gas stations near and well i don't know is
is more a problem that a help but obviously you know obviously
it's better to have a car i think
of course
yes
aha
no i did not listen to it what is the topic
aha but don't you think that also it is like wonderful that that it has changed in like sixty years
ah yes we look like seventy five years ago there were no cars but today almost everyone has
the same thing with computers they have they have computers that that are not going to let out in the market for for like ten years because
because they already have the the very advanced things and the things have not they have not
charged the development costs you understand i don't know how to explain it well but
aha
yes
yes
yes that was an important change
don't you think is an important change or
does that include automobile cars
ah
yeah
ah no ah yes sure sure there are some cars there as for example the the fords
the pickup well the pick up trucks are being changed so that they become more efficient you know
but the expedition and that type of huge cars they do use lots of gas you can only drive around twenty or eighteen miles per gallon or something like that it's a huge amount
ah yes
and why is that
why are the united states one of the only countries to have this why do we have this huge cars you know
most of the countries have small cars well different it's a different culture you know but
ah aha
yes because is a you know a machine
yes but
yes the most obvious is the computer but is not the only one
ah
yes and that is why the same thing you buy a car and you are always using it and you always have to give it maintenance you always have is part of your life
ah faviola hello
then uh i find that if the classification is good they have i think it is the responsibility of the adults where children can go to watch television
they are doing their job with the movies and
is your business you
if now he wants it you take he want to see it he doesn't is no longer their responsibility they see
that sells
and it is what they do it's not their fault only of the one who buys
yes
yes
yes
exactly
how are you
mm i think as well that i am completely in agreement and the other normally the children have access to television when the parents are outside
the children are alone
and there the father isn't there to teach them or say to them this you shouldn't watch yes you should see
of course you don't have a clue
exactly
of course
no and also
yes also and when the kids get to a certain age my son had fifteen years sixteen sixteen years and he would say don't worry because you did the best that you could
ah it is the twenty five percent of the genes and the education and the rest is decision my decision of my life
of course then i learned oh wait no eh oh i was and
very good sunny or cold
my cell phone was ringing ok ok leave that and i answer
eh don't hang up because we have to talk twelve minutes
i just went to pay it
and about people i believe that i love movies watching horror movies
but there are times when when they scare me and i'm an adult
they make me scared and i'm going to find out about horror movies
yes
yes because of that i respect what my son told me that time fifty per cent is responsibility
of of the individual of the person eh you already did what you could but there is a time when children before turning eighteen
that some are more mature than others
cold
and they start to watch the r movies
at fourteen and fifteen years and eleven twelve year old children are watching the pg thirteen
and sometimes even little ones sometimes even younger because i remember jenny's friend that watched harry potter and it's
pg thirteen pg fourteen and then i say jenny doesn't like it it scares her
she's cared of monsters and all that
but yeah i agree that for the most part in the end it's about the criteria you make for her take care of them if you don't want them to watch tv when they're alone
not leaving them alone with the tv
but it's just tv no more you
and you have to have some judgment to watch some movies
aha in the same school they show movies
yes
they show documentaries
continue like like superman the little boy that climbed on the window and killed himself
that i wanted to fly no i i want to ask you a question
eh did you read the rules to the game on the telephone
i was asking myself ah how is this are you already preparing for christmas
you're on a birthday no
that's what i was going to tell you
cook and saw saw that you did that you gave to me
no that the table thing
oh because they're
i had not touched and i touched talking about specifically the person that talked to me talked about violence
that's pretty
it's andreita's birthday too oh three
oh ok yes but i remember that it was like three days
and what what did you buy to miranda
oh that's so nice
aw that's very nice
it's so exciting
and do you know who else's birthday is today
the same day
that i remember when i was there
no he liked the idea of going to see the movies i say that the world is the world it has violence
your father in law yeah
him juan luis sandra's youngest son
also on on the twenty nine i remember that also around the same date i remember that they're all around the same date
no you went to carlitos's birthday and the little girl's
no you were there you went to chile once and you left her the gift for his birthday
ok that was another birthday because she's three
yes for her nephew who came after
sandra will not organise her birthday she will not make a party this year
i didn't say no i mean just for the family because they are going to buy something better for the kid
that's because she does a very big parties
it has always had and i have experience teaching children love and peace on the television or in the world and then when they face the world which is the school area
she spend a lot of money in that and now she can't afford it to the kid
they have to decide between one or another thing this year the kid decided to be with the family
sure to have one more present
the smallest kid of all
and he said he doesn't want any clothes
i don't want books i just want toys
they are the children that do not know how to defend themselves especially when you have unique children
i am ana maria
i agree it is the ultimate responsibility of the parents
and making their money what is your job
doing your business yes
of yes
yes
yes that they like the product in the end that's why
with you that you are have the greatest responsibility be violence sex whatever you want to protect a child for i think the parents have the greatest responsibility although you have a rating
because if you have a movie rating for example pg thirteen
and you have e minor child of that age to see it it's your responsibility
is because you let him and thought that is okay isn't that right
hello faviola
the why the association or whatever he puts eh you have the rating and he already has it then
i think yes look that we think almost the same on that faviola because in the end the responsibility of raising and caring and what you want him to see or not
your children or your family eh you like a mother or your husband like a mother
exactly
mhm
or if they go to a sleepover you don't know also
if they go to a sleepover and they put a movie on they watch the movie or they don't have control in that house or whatever it is
you also don't know
i think what's important is given the kids a that they respect that signs if one gives them good principles in the house one as a family teaches them those things
really i don't like that or because i don't like it that you see it or that you are not prepared or that the moment will come
well and you how is the weather our there in you home
that because like they say you can't keep them in a crystal box
goes exposed or exposed
mhm
look with that
mm
ok
yes
ok ah
ok
you you scare yourself
sunny and cold ah
ok ok but your responsibility is to see it and you scare yourself
ok well i don't like them and i don't watch them i don't watch any kind of those that's also my decision even being old enough to see them if it is too violent i don't want to see it
yes
yeah
um
yeah yes
yeah thirteen right
right
yeah
yeah'cause because
because we are ugly we are cold how are the movies had we already spoken about this issue
but imagine that you still can't control them
that's why i'm telling you you can control them  you can't watch this movie because this and this reason because you're not mature enough or whatever you want to tell them right
yeah that's why i'm telling you you get nothing from telling her  you can't watch that so because there will be a time when she'll go to a house how can i say her friend's house
oh the same school but the same school is a bit more supervised because that is already a different thing because because it goes it goes with an end
but i'm more afraid when he goes to friends' houses and sometimes they have the television in the piece the most that it is used or the computer or whatever it is
and they have access to information without the parents no the parents have no idea and they are in the piece believe the parents believe that they are listening to music or whatever it is
maybe they are looking at something inadequate but that's what i say whatever happens it's that my son and my daughter or whatever it is
are faced with that situation he has to learn to value himself and learn to respond to that that's what they said or rather trying trying to give them the values of the house
it of course because you know that they are not yet prepared
aha
i had already touched on this subject before
yes okay
yes yes i am preparing myself i am already buying my family's presents but at the moment i am with everything with other things on my mind
yes but but i am already preparing buying presents for the family at least for my nephews i already have them ready we have already bought them presents then the big people remain no less
buy the bigger people something an attention either way i am making the majority of the presents
i am going to cook yes ah
yes also for some kids yes too
yes the the yes too but i have no time i still have to wait until mid until the last week of december to do it
because i have no time before
yes and that's what i'm doing too that's why i'm doing some gifts but for example am the andreita for example it's her birthday soon
two days before miranda
mhm
yes she's from twenty five or twenty four i don't remember
three days then from twenty four then i have her little gift i bought her the same i bought for miranda so uh
for the re a screen of those that draw and erase
because she likes it right she already met them and she likes them she draws little lines and then she erases them and she has the i am not going to give them to them yet because they're very little and she would put them in her mouth
but in the mean time the pencil and the screen yes
but yes because things like that
right so you see things like that are a joy to do so i bought the same for little andrea and that's it
no who
who
my father in law that
mhm
yeah that's true who
oh yeah right
i don't remember that he was at at least i didn't know
i haven't been to any birthdays on sandra's house i went to one but i honestly don't remember
oh well that was on april it was april when i went to chile
i leave the presente there
of course he came he told me after i gave it to him but he didn't say his name
no no ok
yes that's true
yes very yes
yeah
what they really want exactly
to have a special gift
juan luis is the oldest or the youngest
oh yes
poor kid
tamara
so what you think of about what they put in the movies
aha
aha
yeah
no i'm not here at my computer sorry
okay
yes because there are enough movies i have noticed
yes i like one for where i live close to before they had some of these new ones ah like hollywood video or blockbuster but it was like
much smaller
they had some movies they were kind of documentaries and like that but it was closed because of the big stores around people don't want to go to those places
yea and you
but those are the best i find movies that i like my husband is american but he also likes international movies movies with more
more important things to talk about
sometimes because we had little children they want to watch movies with use and we take them but not usually time ago we went like two or three times per moth to the cinema
but we have reduced that now it's like once or twice every two months
yes exactly
i'm from panama
oh okay
in then it is true it's true
yeah what you're saying it's true over here i my husband and i we watch the news
because every time you watch something or they show you something really stupid
im in washington seattle
or they exaggerate it a lot
because when i was we were in panama before noriega got out of panama
and we were there and my husband you know he's a white man paper white compared to my dad my dad is brunette and my mom is white so i was darker than my dad so
when we went out you knew he was american
and we both got we got into where we were going and he had to go to work into the base and i had to go with him or something like that
and suddenly we would arrive home and we would watch tv there was so much little things that happened at panama i would watch him
hey weren't you and i by there this morning i don't remember looking nothing like that there
and the next day the same thing i say ay what an exagente i think they were teaching the thing that they showed last week and exaggerating the thing so
it's from that moment that he doesn't want to believe what they say on tv
the news nothing like that that is what i tell my kids do not believe everything that the tv says
oh yeah
because it is not true and that
right
that was the documentary they talked about the man that got his head chopped off
no he doesn't remember
right
oh from churillo
yeah that that's where it was the police was there a part of the police
yeah that
no no because like i told you i don't really look much at the news every now and then
tv
yeah
yes four
aha
tv or tv for all
with
ok
ok
aha
yes
tell me
no maybe but i don't remember
yeah this is it i think this is my twenty third call
mmh
some
aha
yeah and this is the second time i take their services
yeah
yes i know
carolina
did you get the same email right it will apparently continue that's what i understood in the email i received
that's good tell me
well i'll tell you honestly it's been more than a year since we stopped watching movies on regular film
little  conventional
we had a movie for example in the case of film it's the same as with the television now we see this documentarystyle films eh with other messages then
watch movies that are in uh what do you call this lost festivals here is an example the recently completed international latin american film festival
hey if you were
hello
ah okay this will take about a month or so because for a very long time as i say we decided that they were going to continue wasting your time
time in most cases movies really are quite silly with nonsense content and it's good we made the decision because no we did not want to lose any more time or money
tamara how are you
hey seeing that kind of movie didn't really bring anything
yes
okay
of course
exactly exactly
yes
okay we also went like once per month but it was really usual sometime we saw a really stu
pid so dumb that i felt annoyed to be there and well what are we doing here why i'm wasting my time
no no and then we started to get information in other kinds of movies and well we moved completely to that side right now are with
a movement like those we are kind of intellectual but now we have reach a stage where you feel like
good good where are you
what are we doing i mean i prefer going to sleep that to watch those thins but there are movies that have
a really different feeling they are worth but lately i think they are making movies just for doing them
yes it's like  well we have to make 10 movies let's make them how when it doesn't matter
as they role as we said where are you from
oh okay i'm from venezuela
right yes
we say like this  a lo macho right like well yeah make movies whatever but yeah there are some good and others well they're not but
honestly not and the same is happening now with the tv we had cable and just about a month ago we cut it because i don't know suddenly it was like
we were against that we saw there was a lot of manipulation from the media they only show you the news that they want they hide the truth
uh so that's the news level and about the movies so it's like yeah why not a good movie a really good movie
wow i'm in los angeles
but then they repeated it and repeated it and repated it ¡oh my god what's this we're paying for this so it's like a annoying we're annoyed with
with the media we're like reluctant yeah yeah
i think right
exactly
exactly
oh imagine that
yeah obviously
of course
exactly
exact
yeah its incredible its great
exactly
exactly
look casually they let me borrow a movie that was called  la something like  la decepcion de panama or  la defencion de panama
just when the noriega problem and everything else we looked all the documentary i stood cold because in reality i never imagined it to be so depressing and so
so horrible what happened
and oh yeah
i don't remember exactly don't remember but what i remember is that night when they bombarded and so many people died even nowadays they showed one
one recuen of now the visit of this president
it was there and people were protesting that why didn't the current president do something to remember the victims there
i think they were called the risho's from the chinese sector where all that village practically disappeared
i was making a call and then i realized that it was sunday i fell asleep for half an hour more than usual i was like oh my god
uh from chorrillo exactly
right but that one you're talking about look it happens just like that in venezuela with the current president some things are happening that you know they're happening
they happened a long time ago so they say here  something's happening in venezuela and i don't know asshole the other day i wrote to one of the journalists at
univision i told them not to be so cynical don't show things that aren't real the first thing people tells you is  huh that president
and god knows what  he's a mad man no the truth is that they're twisting the information so that they make him look like a monster
a dictator well a dictator and we've been through four elections already and 4 referendums i mean it can't be more democratic but it's his personality and he has a personality that's
it's uncommon and people doesn't accept that and he's not vulgar he's not common and people doesn't accept that so he even is the first to criticize all that
and and oh well i don't know if you've heard him
sure sure look there's a website in the internet where you can watch tv from all countries including panama of course it's called
tv 4 all like tv four all
yeah yeah you got me out of base but do you have time participating in this
four all
four it is a number four
tv number four all
exactly exactly there you go
it is dot com yes
there you se programming from all the channels all the channels of the world then there of course panama and venezuela and there now i now i watch television from venezuela
but i specifically watch the government channel there the national channel because the other channels belong to the opposition so of course it is a little more of the same
but i like to watch it to see what stupidities they are saying
then i compare it and since i have this webpage now i don't turn the tv on now we are there glued to the internet watching the channels from
from around the world a little bit like to buy you see what is happening and even we are doing the same with radio we listen to community radio radio that you feel it is
wow you're almost ready i'm halfway there im on the tenth part
it is truly telling you the truth or at least the other side of the coin let's not say that it is the truth one hundred percent because sometimes it is not
i mean it is not i don't know but you can't say either that that all that the others tell us it is not but
damn truly they manipulate it too much
i don't know if you
did you give yourself one i don't know if you saw here a movie called auto fox
it was a documentary that worked at fox news
and well they practically forced them to say what was not and then they decided to resign from the station and besides resigning they got together and started to protest at a certain level
well at a certain a local level to tell the world how they were doing inside fox news it is very interesting it is called something like
fox workers who are outside
something like out or out
oh okay okay yeah because i casually received a letter that they are taking intakes so they can participate again because at first you could have only participated once
and fox like fox news
hi my name is fernanda
what what a classification
but i think that the majority of people that we have lets say during half day is when most kids are at home
they're things that are not really appropriate for the majority
and i think that the americans like um their morals have lowered do you understand so
more things are normal i don't think they should be that way
ha
mhm
of course
ok
of course and
how is
um
ah
it's horrible
yes and that could happen to any kid watching television
and you can not be on top let's say if the kid chages you can not jump and see i mean you have to trust let's say at least during the day
the programming will not have naked stuff or groos things or anything like that
yes
in mexico city mmh
i yes i look i am colombian and i think that in colombia
television is much better that here in this sense
from washington
because can happen let's say at ten at night and the programs that they sure are never you don't run the risk no that they are as bad as here here
it is more here not even at ten or any time you run the risk of seeing anything
ah yes
what a horror
yes
yes imagine when let's say there are there are babysitters and things like that you don't have center and you are not at home to see
you don't know what they are watching when they go to their friends' or anything
i think
yes
mhm
washington dc
clearly
no i
exactly
they don't care mhm
sometimes and
yes yes yes
sure sure
yes we don't know how its going to change
exactly
i am getting use to it myself do you understand me we say
yes washington state
like i sometimes i see that i don't realize how much are changing the things
and you where are you
yes yes yes of course
yes honestly i don't know much about movies because
lets say i don't have kid or anything so i'm never aware
my name is
you have a lot of profanity and and pornography that sometimes is more forward for example pg thirteen sometimes is more i don't know it's quieter
and there isn't too many things like nudity and profanity for me honestly ah those classifications for me no sometimes no
they don't know people that critique those movies no don't know how to classify them or or i don't know what your point of view would be
ha
ha
ha
ha
yeah
yeah
yeah that's true because once well i don't have cable i have normal cable the ones that
hi fernanda how are you my name is claudia
but for example i had cable for a little while and sometimes like what at like ten in the morning and i like changing channels
so that i can choose my program that i'm going to see during that time
and sometimes the put some movies that are not right for a ten years old he was watching it and i was changing him at the same time
i stopped in that channel there were things that were for adults
the i said ufm i said i thought the kids i said well i i i'm married three years married and i have a boy of almost 2 years old
maybe my son will grow and maybe this will move forward for the worst then
imagine later the kind of cartoons gone to well i remember that once i was watching television look in mexico i'm from mexico city
it was ten at night exactly ten at night then i had eh i had cable there and had the the the cable to
the channel that here is ten and six then there was a cartoon in english because at night the show some in english some in spanish
and there was an english cartoon then i quit and thi my mom was then then was quite watching a cartoon television channel
where are you speak good from where are you speaking
well the monkeys started to show up naked
and the monkey was startind to do its things with the two cartoons and it was a cartoon and then at night and my mom told me
she turned off the television and had to explain me a little because she does not not she was surprised because i was watchin a cartoon channel a normal channel
then the truth now not even the cartoons are safe
sometimes cartoons yes
yes
yes yes it is true but really it is not the cartoons i'm sorry japanese cartoons are are the most rated eh they have in mexico eh
eh on cablevision and multivision which would be what cable here there in mexico doesn't have too many restrictions but for example on regular television normal channels
they have like more more restrictions eh not so much on other cables and for example in on tv for example normal channels for children
television like that any channel the channel for example which is five in caricatures
ah which one of the two
for example then it goes until ten at night eleven and you an watch tv and they don't show such ugly programs well
before in mexico but for example if you are watching a cable channel you already risk that the cartoon can be about something that sometimes that some
things of pornography or more nudity
then uy aha
aha
aha
yes yes it is true the other well eh i was with a neighbor imagine i was with a neighbor it was twelve twelve thirty in the day
then her boy was watching eh the a cartoon channel and then the girl decided to change the tv and and it was another channel that also was programmed for them for children
well there was a program where there was where there was a a girl who had adventures of a girl and who was in a hospital
and suddenly went there the same hospital it was already happening that like his mom was having her brother
ah yes because after i think there two no
aha but you could see it and i grabbed her and i told her to her mother and she told me there is no problem it is a channel of
of of cartoons of of they show shows and sincerely it was it was no they didn't leave much to the imagination it was really like posing well but it was an operations room where the woman was having her baby
they were they are six years old
because they are twins she has eh both are six years old and their mother was letting them see that well each each parent allows them to see what
whatever they want but honestly i i don't want to explain so much to my children at this moment because honestly i watch more what they
what they watch no in that respect but uf
mm aha
yes no
yes it is like that really those ratings they give and n and n and principally from the television the truth already already n
they don't leave nothing to the my to the imagination they show it to you
ah ok and the other
already at any at any time of the day you watch one of those soap operas i don't like watching soap operas but you see
how much mom is at home and has little children three four years five or more or are at home and see they are watching their soap opera
and always there are scenes were they are the a couple there they are having relations
and in broad daylight because the soap operas then passed from one to six in the morning until it was dark
and that's the way it is it leaves nothing to the imagination
then the programs are already sorted and a scene of pornography on television at any time of day is normal and for many
parents this unfortunately is normal
and i think that if parents would talk to the television stations and say that they should require more stringent programs like the privacy of scenes such scenes
i think it would go down a bit but that no longer happens and even if parents and their children see something they're like  oh okay no problem
that will be taught and then so will these classifications i do not like and i don't think these producers care i feel that to them it is because
yes i'm here in idaho state i don't know if you've heard of it
if a movie has a sex scene or is too rude for people to buy or for people to see it it gives them laughs
or is sometimes called to attention because it has a very strong scene sometimes these things do more to help them
helps producers to sell
then no for me in particular the movies i like to tell you the truth are disney
children's films i like them
though now i'm married and i love all that i have some here from another disney movie honestly i do not like movies
strong so that have a lot things of sex because i am going to repeat myself i have more children and in awhile i am not going to be
at least if they going to put a movie then the movie will have to be decent at least that don't have a lot stuff
that if we keep going like that maybe until disney is going to be porno right so
no so if this is getting true this is getting very far if you turn on the tv you watch a commercial
yes this one the truth is a lot of that is movies the truth is a lot of things em from my point of view really there isn't much in common with me because after
of female pads it seems good so almost they are going to explain how to they put a naked woman and they are going to
put there how to place the pad
because sometimes even they draw her i don't know i have seen the commercials so you dont afraid because your big no but
but if a boy or a girl is watching by example and you say if the mom is there its fine and if his friends
answer you can explain the bad information so
so now yes
you don't know how to classify it very very well eh for example after sometimes they say it's pg and after eh you see that movie and really
good evening i'm mariza from philadelphia
in another form it it christianity is the most powerful religion in the world and they are the most let's say they have the most power to influence politicians in those countries
mmhm
mhm yes
yes
mhm
for real
ah ah no
so that i have heard that yes
exactly yes there are many problems yes
no each can believe what they want what happens is that they try to impose their belief for all the world and to be the bible that it be the what think
mariza mariza
yes what fundamentalism yes yes yes the right but it ia also the country is eh the power is with the party and the all from the president and all involved in is in the white house they are all the conservative rights
whites the eh cristians and what are they what the people with power in the countrythe ones that have the companies all the world are same they are many people fundamental conservative at right they want to remove the law
the right to have an abortion for example how another question was about homosexuality gay marriages the beleif right the of
yes more scientific no no we should not believe only on what they say they say god created man and woman also to give an opinion so the children can beleive
that was charles darwin the theory of evolution and
and it's very complicated the the other question was about homosexuality yes yes if everyone was the same or believed the same there would be no problems it asked
but
yes
sure for me i don't have any
mhm
oh maybe yes
yes i i'm convinced that it's that because i know many people that are
eh well homosexuals or lesbians and i'm very well informed and then for that yes always i don't know because since i am since i was a girl
like you accept people for i didn't think that they were better nor worse for being homosexuals and everyone has a right to to well i don't know to marry to
to be with whom they want it's the same if it's a man or a woman i care i don't care and i think that they have the same rights because they are citizens all the same and they pay the same taxes
they should have the right to marry to live with anyone
mhm
sure but the the church doesn't see it like that
think that that's an abomination because marriage is defined as a union between a man and woman they believe and it and the people and the devoted christian fundamentalists just like i was saying before they see this as an abomination and they are so closed off that they don't understand that
that's maybe how it was before the way people thought before was traditional but now the times are changing and everyone well is equal and as they were before homosexuality has always been since the beginning of mankind but what's happened now is that before there was a way to deal with it and now well
it's going i don't know things are becoming more liberal and let's say and people don't have fear anymore to say well i'm homosexual or i'm gay or i'm whatever i am
in san antonio yes
that's the problem the church has a problem but they can't do anything because
people are accepting the fact that people yeah well if you at a person who's homosexual yes and they're worthwhile people so then
sure
yes
yes religion has to be something personal not something that is to be mixed with politics each person can the whatever he thinks whatever he believes doesn't have any reason to
eh well look just because you don't think that same way i do because you're not like i am well like they punish them for not being the same and that's not each person can think what they want to believe in who or whatever it doesn't have to
by christians because they speak ill of the muslims because they say they are radicals or talk ill of the of the atheists because they do not believe in god and they call them heretics or
but i don´t know
that is not very christian if so you have to accept people like they are and every one believe or have his own religion but that is the problem of the fundamentalists they don´t accept differences
hmm
yes which is a very complicated and polemical
what happens is that if it is that in this country the children when they are those families christian families from the right wing let´s say they raise their children in a way that they teach them since they are very little that things must be that way and then then
when they are adults and meet different people then they say that is not that way because i was taught that is like this and this and this and it must be like this
you know they are very radicals not they don´t accept the differences because they were raised in a way their parents did then
for example me i had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of all the races several cultures then i am open minded to everything
and because of that when i see a person that is not i immediately know it only by seeing the person i say this person is not going to accept me because i am not like her i am not i don´t think alike i don´t look alike
but it is that there are people of all kinds and and well there must be radicals christians there must be everything but i think that if the country has a lot of influence the religion yes
yes
yes i they are
of course yes yes
the message is very clear and it has been five years of ruling and when bill clinton was in office well he wasn't much he was more open of course he was a leftist more opene one more person
mmhmm
that understood more the things to the persons and this government take it the religious the christian of righties i mean the ones who are
saying how things are made in the country and that is why there is so much controversy with marriage it's also with the supreme court with the jury who want them to be righties and religious well
catholics or whatever they might be they also want to to take off the rights of abortion and stuff like that that is ridiculous in this height of this century
like they they want things to go backwards go backwards instead of going forward they want things to be like thirty or forty years and that can't be
but that is how we are right now
me in my family we are in spain i am cat catholicism say is when you are born and they baptize you the first communion and all that
i think i'm goo and i have my thoughts but i don't go to church every sunday nor practice religion i know but don't practice i am i think
but we say that i speak for myself and what we say i will carry with me
or or i'm not and won't be i am very open and it would be contradictory if i thought that i am catholic but i know i'm not i am not covered
yes yes yes there is a lot of economic interest
yes
the is the problem it's that they are not immediately interested in happiness they are interested in the money an
and also they are seen not to be very faithful as there have been many cases of child abuse and things like child abuse
you hear these things and wonder how this can be possible that a priest does this to a child and there is much controversy about that
but we say that faith is not that each individual is free to believe whatever you want and practice it but also have respect for others who are not well
but there are many religion that it occurs in that is the christian religion and more is said as it is the most abundant religion in the world is the most and has the most power
yes but the problem is they don't have much economic power
it is really today in this country uh in the united states too there's a big big problem with religion that it mixes with politics and there are a lot of people on the right who want control
they intend to control the country based on religion also and it can be positive or negative for many people well it helps to pray or to believe in something it helps them and others in others of others
hello hello my name is juan you are marisol
then they exercise a very direct power very clear trying to influence the people there at church
in the sermon above all what attracted my attention against the public school
directly against public school and they were praying so god could free us from public school one day
why what yes
and against the theory that that they try to see the evolucion theory no
no terrible they said because it is harrassing to teachers that teach the bible to explain world creation
well the train will take me well i say well is that with all reason no the bible does not explain the world
exactly they are fundamentalism no
yes
but i think that maybe the more similar we are the more problems we have no
maybe mariza we talked a few days ago i believe right
in that sense differences help complement
the topic the topic of homosexuality is very polemic
but in a given time it's not a let's see like tolerance the phenomenon of homosexuality must be something that that in which we're very well informed no i personally think for example before i thought
it could be a deviation homosexuality but lately i have read that it's also a question a genetic issue
no
well yes
yes
yes yes i agree with you i believe exactly that they all have rights well we can have any kind of person and in this case with respect to the relative rights of marriage
well a lot of people pose the question of homosexuality as an issue very perverse and that they have the right to marriage not when it's a quest of when the marriage is in reality a contract
between two people that decide to do something in common
it could be i'm in san antonio texas
no
aha
of course yes it's an extreme of the eh the family and marriage the ecclesiastical institution and the blessings of god for a marriage and things that when in reality
well the church and religion are forms of institution it's also that in school there's
the necessity of first to change and find new new ways of learning the lessons of life
about society and of individuals right
aha
yes well but in this case to accept the differences looks like something that relates to a matter of humanity right
is like a paradox to do not accept the difference they think but aha
yes
okay so today's theme is uh the question of religion
aha
eh yes it has a lot of influence what amazes me is that in this case
in this country they are so fundamentalists right
with the churches there is a good proportion of fundamentalists even in the president speech there are some fundamentalism
not there
right
right and you have practically some religion in particular
of course
yes
if the same thing happens to me sometimes and when i have a temporary problems with the church because it's catholic i can almost almost hear you say that there is a sense of integration and community here
exactly like how the need for religion is something that that we all have i suppose
it seems they have interest in all
then no
yes
yes
i see
well in the world that is not true just because we have it on this side of the world because i do not think most would think it even the majority of christians believe that there are more muslims than christians
mhm
and this like all needs institutions try to
to provide an answer and it ends up being a form of control right
if you look at that case for example here where i live once i went to a church
that totally represented an ideological project but that by plan is among the most conservative groups there is in the united states
hi good evening
colombian
yes i've had it the truth is that for ten years i've been wihing for the technologies to advance no
because it has to be advanced no
mhm mhm
of course yes
mmm cla

that anyone can get
yes right
oh my god in three days oh
oh right sure
oh my god
oh i see
oh my god
uh
oh
uh um
uh um
oh that's good
right yes
yeah sure right
good evening my names is carolina
yes well tonight's subject is about technological devices
yeah
mhm
yeah aha
mhm
mhm yea aha
yes
very slow yes
yeay sure
yeah sure
how are you alex
mm mhm
um yeah of course
well to me also sure and i work my work i am a manager and then uh i use it for work and to me the computer i mean that
the most essential and mostly uh and the new technologies right the new technology that has come out and every day new things come out right
and i have really adapted well and i've loved it since i've been using the computer because before when we used the typing machine it was so slow to
write forms and documents and everything now everything is done through the computer and the interer right so it's something wonderful
to me it's essential i think i don't know what i could do without the computer right so i'm really happy with this new technology and i wish it keeps
going forward more every day right
that's true
right yes and for everything right i mean it's all you
oh very good i am i am in new york
want you can find it there and when you take a seat on the well i use it for work but also when i'm home and i need
some information well i sit on the computer and no one can stop me that when it's like an essential part of your life right
for everything because if you need to know how's the weather out there well you go to the computer
before it was um
yes yes yes
oh yes also oh
sure how many calls have you made
oh and he so you are almost done
oh i see i see
yeah aha
yeah
mm i see
but do they make the payment once you finish the twenty five calls or not
yes oh i see aha
oh really
oh uh do you know the owner
oh that's good
oh he's from is he from california
oh right right right
oh but do you know him in person
oh just through the computer
oh well very good please to talk to you
through the internet ok right
oh yeah oh yeah oh no i have never spoken to him i
oh yeah
oh
yes
okay okay okay
yes of course and
yes yes i knew and besides yes i think that also another one is going to start after one finishes this one
mm
oh this one is your second oh yes
well tonight we have to talk about technical appliances
oh oh
okay okay ah and the other one was the same twentyfive calls
okay and they paid you the same also
oh okay okay
ah how great
of course
mm ya
oh ok aha
ok
well of course of course it is
i am from peru
exactly aha
exactly
aha
oh but right here
of course but here at the united states
yes of course i just get a verizon phone they were offering to make free calls here at the states
and they charge me
yes of course
oh that's nice
okay
and you
that's really good it would be excellent to call your country anytime you like i think it will be true because with that other thing the cards
back in time it was really expensive do you remember for calling your country
a lot cheaper
yeah you're right
now you can speak three or five hours for 5 dollars
before it was only a minute oh my god it was about like eight
yes i remember that i had to talk i think that ten minutes alone used to cost me like twentyfive dollaras
and i had to be very careful cause they used to be with forward clock no
yes like that
aha clearly yes
yes good evening
mhm
because there is there is more demand
because there is the technology it was it has advanced
what i would like to see
more advanced technology with medicine
they have to look for cures like ah cancer eh if you can go to the moon why can't they find a cure for cancer yes it can be yes they can do a
super fast computer that can think why can't they find a cure to cancer
i want to see more advances on illnesses i believe that they are going too slow in that area
i have not seen many advances in about illnesses in the last ten twenty thirty forty years
well
yea how many people right does it kill
because here we speak in mexican spanish
right and that shortens a lot of peoples lives
or heart disease as well
hiv is more advanced than cancer in in
in the sense of controlling the virus because there are drugs to control it
but cancer goes through your system too slow
have you ever heard about a new cure for cancer
i havent nothing
its slow
they could improve that
yes
that's why
yes yes
i i had a friend that died young at thirty two and one day she got cancer
and she died in three days
yes because she had a bleeding in her brain
and and she died immediately she had luk leukemia in the blood
and that she got that overnight
right and they couldn't do anything about it right
they couldn't uh
you get the you get the accent of where you live
with the when i lived in spain i got the the spanish accent
when i lived in colombia i got the colombian spanish specially the one from bogota
now i got the mexican spanish
which is what's spoken here
oh and i think that hispanics here are like ninety five per cent mexican
yes
oh how are you carolina your are speaking with alex
yes well i use i use computers
and ah i have d s l really fast now
yes i love it because i like it because the fast internet i don't like waiting for pages
so it's very useful because i'm look for work i do surveys look for women
mma many things and and i don't like to wait for the the pages you get me
i like to do it quickly and and before it when i was when i had the line by phone
it was very slow
so i had to wait some two or three minutes just for a single page to appear
and so far well i don't have a webcam and and the webcam comes up fast with the d s l
the webcam is when they can see you ah like in tele li video conference conference
from los angeles
it's fast
and you
yes
um sure i think that they have uh they have done more discoveries on the computer than what they have on medicine
the computer is the most advanced thing in today's civilization
yes
yes exactly
news sports
ah dates with women everything
no and even this survey that we are discussing now i found it online too
oh okay i thought that that that it was another person are you okay
yes almost mm so the internet does have a lot of influence
in our lives twenty two this is a twenty two calls
yes i'm almost done i still have three left one of them is a call in which someone spoke mostly in english so i think i will have to replace him
but who knows
because i did speak in spanish so maybe they will count that one too
because if you speak in english they don't count the call
