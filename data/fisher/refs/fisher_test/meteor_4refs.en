because really imagine that for example you go to to to to to decide your course note in your exam and all of a sudden the prevous night you could not sleep well o
because imagine that for example your whole grade was to be decided by a test maybe the night before you couldn't sleep well
because really image that for example you wen to to to to to to determine your grade on a class in one test maybe the night before you couldn't sleep well or
whichever may have happened and all of a sudden
anything can happen an all of a sudden
anything could have happened and then
anything could have happened and suddenly
in the exam you don't all of a sudden you may have prepared a lot but for x reason it didn't go well in the exam then
in the exam you don't make it or i say you could have prepared a lot but for x reason you did not do well in the exam
you don't perform well in the test you might have studied a lot but for any reason you didn't do well in the test then
you don't do so well in the test i mean maybe you would have prepared a lot but for x reason you didn't do well on the test then
i mean let's say your grade
i mean let's say the note
i mean let's say that the grade
i mean lets say the grade is going to

let's see i mean i would tell you also they make us work i mean we don't like the the equivalent to midterms
well i would say that they make us work we don't have the equivalent midterms
let´s see i can tell you they gave us that task must be as a midterms
but they're mostly reading controls
but that are primarily reading tests
but they are at most reading controls
i think everything is about lecture controls
uh through all i mean spread let's say through the semester
eh throughout i mean scattered let's say throughout the semester
spread l mean spread all along the semester
let's say along the semester
and for some courses not all of them you're also asked to at the end of the course to deliver an essay a research paper
and for some classes not all they also ask you at the end of the class to to hand in an essay a research project
and for some courses they ask at the end of the course to present and essay an investigation paper
and for a few courses no all they ask you at the end of the course an essay investigation task
and also you also have a final exam but let's say you don't have to produce as much as you do here
and besides you also have a final exam but let's say you don't have to produce as much as you produce here
and besides that you also have a final exam but let's say you don't have to make as much as you do here
and also the final exam but you don't have to work as hard as here
i mean you don't have to write much
i mean you don't have to write so much
so you don't have to write that much
i mean you don't have to write that much
here they're like constantly making you writing papers and reviews Âright
here they have you constantly writing papers and reviews isn't it like that
here they keep you constantly writing papers and reviews right
here they keep you writing all the time papers and reviews isn't
there not so much i mean there instead what you had to write for example you wrote it in the exam or to give in that is in the investigation
not much beyond or rather beyond what you had to write for example write for examination or deliver or in research
there not a lot o be there more well what i had to write for example i wrote in an exam or to deleiver an investigation
not so much over there i mean over there rather you had to write it for example you wrote it or in the exam or or to turn it in i mean the research
in the final semester but aside all of that no you didn't have to produce much
at the end of the semester but beyond that no you did not have to produce much
at the end of the semester but out of that no no no have to produce a lot
at the end of the semester but other than that no no you didn't have to produce much
eh i study history
i'm studying history

and well i mean that could be seen as advantageous in the sense that you don't have they don't ask you much i mean
well i mean that could be seen as an advantage the sense that you don't have do not no do not ask for much not true or is
and well or this could be seen like ahead in the sense that you don't have they don't they don't they don't ask you for much or be
and well i mean that could be seen as advantageous in the sense that you don't have they don't no they don't ask so much of you right i mean
one can live more relaxed

but the point is the disadvantage is that you don't come you don't get to practice your your no you are not in a constant practice of labor of
but at this point the downside is that you do not get you can not practice you do not you're not in a constant practice of the work
but to the point the disadvantage is you do not get you manage to practice you you you you no no you are on a constant practice from the labor this
but this point the disadvantage is that you don't you don't practice your your your your no you're not in constant practice of of the work
investigation and neither about how to describe right i mean sometimes one for not writing much one loses ease right write so
of research nor how to describe not true or sometimes yo not to describe all that you lose a little not all but to describe then
from investigation and also of of how to describe not real or is at times one for not writing as much so a little loses easiness not true to writethen
of research and neither of of how to write right i mean sometimes for not writing so much you loose practice right to write so
i would tell you that i mean it's more it's easier right i mean
i tell you that like is more like easier like
that is why i said or is more is more easy or is
that's what i would tell you i mean it's more it's easier no i mean
it's easier but i don't know if it is say if they form it so well like they form it here
it's a lot easier but i don't know that tell you if they prepare you like they do here
is more easy but i do not know if is lets say yes if it form you as well that they form you
it's easier but i don't know if it's let's say if they form you as well as they form you here

people don't believe that they're born like that but he really was born like that and only if you have someone like that in your family you know so he
people don't believe they are born like that but he was born like that and only if you have someone in your family then you know then he
people don't believe they are born like that but he was born like that and only if you have someone in your family is that you know so he

of course it is much more difficult but i believe it will be good in the long run but not very good so far with the language is an advantage
sure yes it should be a lot more difficult but well i believe well in the long term it is going to be very good also no that way you grow up with two languages and that is a strenght
of course yes it would be more difficult but well i think well in the longrun it would be good too right growing up with these languages is an advantage
sure yes it has to be much harder but but i think in the long run is going to be very good also like that they grow up with two languages which is an advantage

well i hope she stays like that because then when she's growing and a lot of her friends speak english she's going to practice english more i think
well yes i hope it goes on like that because then when she starts growing and more of her friends speak english well they're going to practice english i think aren't they
then yes hopefully she remains that way because when she start growing more and lots of her friends talk in english she will practice more of it i think
well yes hopefully and she maintains like that because then when she starts to grow up and and many of her friends speak english well then they will practice english more
ah okay
oh ok
ah okay
ah okay
ah
ah
ah
ah
yeah
aha
aha
aha
yes that's true
yeah that's true
yes that's true
yes that is true
yeah Âwhere are you from
yes where are you from
yes where are you from
yes where are you from
but what do you think about her not having school mates
but but and what do you think about i mean that she's not going to have school friends that that
but but what do you think about the fact she will not have school colleagues and such
but but what do you think of the that they will not have school companions that that
that's also not an experience bone
that is an experience too no i mean
that's an experience too no i mean
that is an experience too no like
aha
ok
aha
aha
ah okay
ah ok
ah ok
ah okay
ah okay
oh ok
ah ok
ah okay
the
the
the
el
ah okay
ahh ok
ah ok
ah okay
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes of course that's what i was thinking that's part of the experience no to be in school with people you know
yes sure that is what i was thinking because if i mean a part of the experience of be in the school is get to know people
yes of course that's what i was thinking because if i mean it's part of the experience no of being at school that you meet people
yes right that is what i was thinking at because yes is part of the experience no being in a school and know people
so i think that too it's important you don't need that when you're a kid because to have true friends is very important
then i think so that is important that it doesn't matter when you are a kid because its true that you're friends are very relevant
so i think that also that's important its not that is not that you miss that when your a kid because truly your friends are very important
the i think that is important too is that it doesn't have to be that way when you are a child because the truth is you friends are very important
oh ok
ah okay
ah ok
oh ok
i don't think so
i don't think so
i think no
i think no

but yes as long as i had a contact with other people unless one
yes there are many is that here there's a lot of contribution from the community right and that
there is much it is that here there is a lot of contribution from the community of course and that
yes there are many the thing is that here there is big support to the community really and that
yes there is many is because there is a lot of assistance to the community true and that
yes i see
yes i see
yes i see

yes yes yes yes i like anything in mexico that is not common understand me absolutely does not happen

and nothing i have a five year old daughter i couldn't say my life has changed sure because children change your life but she's so little she has so much future
and nothing i have a five year old daughter i can not say that well my life has changedsure because children change your life but she is still so little that she still needs some
and nothing i have a five years old daughter is i couldn´t tell him well my life has changed of course because children change our lives but she is so young that still has much
and so well nothing i know it's different when kids are older they become more independent but i still have to go through that
and then nothing i don't know it's different when children are older they are more independent but i still have to go through that
and then well nothing don't know is different when your children are older they became more independent but i still have to go through that
and then well nothing i don´t know is different when your children are older if they become more independent but i have still to go through that

and of course
yes yes everybody says that
yeah the yeah everybody tells me the same
yes the yes everyone tell me the same
yes yes everybody tell me the same
yes
yeah
yes
yes
yes it has also been hard for me to think abut which one is better and which one is but
yes it also took me effort to think what was the best and what the worst
yes i too think cost what is the best and what is the worst
right it's been hard to me to think which is the best and which is but
well i believe that the same like you to to have children eh well i only have one and i don't believe that i don't know if i'll have more
well i think that as you said having having children well i have only one and i don't think i don't now if i'll have more
well i think that the the same as you the having kids eh well i have only one and i don't think that i don't know if i'll have more
well i believe that the same as you to have children well i only have one and i don't believe that i don't know if i will have more
was not not i mean i don't believe i was ready to being mother maybe because it was a big change and oh the pregnancy was really hard and the oh
it was i mean i don't think i was ready to be a mother maybe because it was a very big change and the pregnancy was very difficult
it was no no i mean i don't think that i was ready to be a mother maybe because it was a very big change and ah the pregnancy was very difficult and the ah
it was no no i mean i don't think i'm ready to be a mother because it was a really big change and the pregnancy was hard and the ah
the we have raised her my husb my husband and i here both alone then it was a little bit difficult but also was of course to have a kid change your life then so it is the best that have happened to me i say
we we've raised her my husband and i here all alone then it was a little difficult but sure having a child changes your life so it's the best thing that happened to me i say
the we have raised her my hus my husband and i are here on our own so it was a bit difficult but also it was of course having a child and your life changes so well it's the best then that has happened to me i say
he we have raised her my husband and me here alone so it was a little difficult but it was also clear that having a son changes lives so then it's the best that has ever happened to me

of course
of course and and why the the other questions was what could be different if i have not lived that maybe have not being mother well my life would be very different
sure and that's why the other question was what would have been different if that didn't happen and i think that if i wasn't a mother my life would be very different
sure and and that's why the other question was if it would have been different if that had not happened maybe if i had not been a mother my life would have been very different
of course and and that is why the other question would have been different if that hadn't happened maybe if i wasn't a mother my life would be very different
i had finished the studies too had
i might have finished school i might have
i would have finished my studies all the same i would have
the same i would have ended my studies i would have

sure achieved a more important career or i would have traveled more or known a different person but of course you never know that you can only imagine
of course gotten a more important career or i would have traveled more or met someone else but of course that can't be known only imagined

it's easy to say what is most important eh because excluding that off course without that i don't know i traveled allot i've met interesting people that you can't compare with
it's easy to say that it's the most important eh because apart from that it's clear apart from that well i don't know i have traveled a lot i have met interesting people but i don't know how to compare with
it's easy to say that it is the most important because besides that well i have not travel that much i've met interesting people but i don't know if their comparable with

hmm i don't i haven't paid a lot of attention to those ratings
well mmh look that i don't aha i have not paid attention to those those ratings
i can't understand them very well
i end up no understanding them very well either
in the end i don't understand them very well either
i end up not understanding them very well
i think they are uh a little bit complicated instead they should have a little bit more information about what they have
i think that they are ehm a little complex better yet they should have a little more information of what is it that they have
i think they're a little complicated they should have instead a little more information about what they have
it seems that they are eh a little complex they would better have a little more information than they have
ok but in general as i no longer have little children
no btu in general since i don't have small children anymore
but since i don't have small children anymore
no in general since i have little children
uh children well i don't worry too much
ehm children well i don't worry much
eh kids i don't worry too much
eh children then i don't worry much
about those classifications however i worry because when we go to see a movie that's worthy that's interesting and not just any movie then the classification
by those classifications i worry more in every case for when are we going to see a movie that is a movie that is worth it that has something interesting and not go to any movie then the classification
about those ratings i worry when we go to watch a movie that it's a movie that's worth it that has something of interest not any movie then the rating
for those ratings i worry in any case because when we are going to see a movie that is a movie that is worth it that has some interest and not go to any movie then the rating
i'm not so interested in that as much as i am in the quality and the comments i hear about the movies right
it doesn't interest much like the quality and the comments that i listen about the movies no
doesn't interest me as much as the quality and opinions i hear about the movies
i don't care as much as the quality and the comments i hear about the movies no
that's it that's what i'm interested about it's i don't know if you do the same if you always go with go alone or if you go with someone
that is that is what calls my attention a little more it is i don't know if the same would to you you always go with you go alone or go with someone
that's that's what draws my attention a little i don't know if the same happens to you do you go alone or with someone else
that is that is what catches my attention a little it is i don't know if this happens to you as well you always go with do you go alone or do you go with someone

ah for me how curious
oh to me ehm look that strangely
what worries me the most in the movies is language and the violence
that which worries me the most in movies is the language and violence
what i worry about most in movies is the language and violence
what worries me the most in movies is the language and violence
generally because like you say when there is an exaggeration in language
regularly because like you say when there is an exaggeration en the language
regulary because like you say when there is an exxageration in the language
regularly because like you say when there is an exaggeration in the language
or in violence everything else is the same
or in the violence then everything else is the same
o in the violence of most equal
or in the violence everything else is the same
so when the movie is like that r well obviously it will have scenes of all types
so when the movie is like this rated r well obviously it is going to have all kinds of scenes
so when the movies like so r well evidently they will have scenes of that type
so when the movie is like that r well obviously it is going to have like that scenes of all kind
those are free so then r appear more than restricted they look more like if you don't have much information about the movie it's exaggerated in all levels
those are free so rather rated r seems more than restrictions it seems like if you don't have much information about the movie it is exaggerated in all its elements
those are free and so betterr they seem more restrictive like you don't have much information of the movie are exxagerated in all of the elements
those are free so more like r seems more than restricted it looks like if you didn't have much information about the movie it is exaggerated in all of the elements
yes
yes
yes
yes
mhm
mhm
mhm
hmm
yes but look at that

there not available at the theaters
available in theaters right
they are simply not really good
are not good
there there no good
they are they are simply not good
then no let's not worry much abouth that information because my kids are already teenagers we always go to the theater all together
then we get worried a lot about the information and my children are teens now and we always go the movies together but
then no we worry a lot because of the informacion since my sons are adolescents we always go together to the theater but
then not we we care a lot about that information as my children are teenagers we always go to the movies together but
we always go for the quality of the movie more than anything else then
we go primary because the quality of the movies then
we mostly go for the quality of the movie then
we mostly go because of the movies quality
the the classification they have to orieented us about the movies it really does not give us much information no
it that way the classifications they have to orientate us well it doesn't provide real information they don't
he in that sense the classification has to be for orientation about the movie since they really don't give information no
he in that sense the classification they have here to guide us about the movie well it does not really give information
we don't take it in consideration
we don't care about i
we don't take then into account
we don´t care about it

listen yeah in that case when we for the children's education
here it those cases for the education of our kids
you see in that case when we for our kids' education
we've never done any acts of censorship we
we have never made act censorship actions we
we have never censored anything
we've never done an act an action of censorship we
we've tried to discuss or talk about the issue when we see strong scenes
what we have tried is that when there are strong scenes we try to comment on them no
what we have done it's commenting the scenes if they are strong scenes
what we've tried to do is when strong scenes come up we try to discuss them no
we discuss them and we tell them this happens and when we are worried about this we say  hey that was really unnecessary they could've cut it out of the film that was rude
we talk about them and decide if ti was well regularly it's when we worry and we say listen it was not necessary there's no point in having used such ugly language
we comment them and we decide if it was strong or not only it's when we are worried
we discuss them and we say if they were because that's usually what worries us we say hey that's bad we shouldn't have watched it the language was pretty ugly
no we analyze it and so we take advantage of it as a way to educate our kids
no we we analyze and then we take use it as part of our children's education
we analize it and then take something to educate our children
we don't we analyze it and then we use it as part of our kids' education
it generally works for us it works really good it has i don't they are older now
in general it works very well because or should i say it worked because they're all grown up now

so they are going to find out about those things in the end they are going to have opportunities to see all those things
yes and they will find something like that on the way they're always going to have a chance to see all that
yes no and the thing is that they will encounter it in life they will always have the opportunity to see all of that
yes no and it's that they'll always run into it on the way they'll always have the opportunity to watch all that
but what yes talking about those things is that censure or the information that that should be censured or
but what what we are speaking about in these questions is that censure or the information that that supposedly should be censured
but what is what speaking of those things is that censorship or information that that supposedly should be censored or
but the thing the thing that if talking about these questions is that the editing or the information that supposedly ought to be censored or
that type of thing i have never though of it has good because
these types of things for i've never thought have been good because
that sort of thing i have never thought it was good because
that type of thing never seemed a good to me because
well that there is too much information about movies that it would be convenient to go see with your family
well there is a lot of information about the movies that it's convenient to go see with the family
there is a lot of other information about movies that are good to watch with your family
well there is a lot of other information about the movies that are appropriate to go to see with your family
and after the movie eat together what happens is and inform ourselves what the movie is about the message the quality with which is made and so on
and after the movie to talk about what happened and educate in turn about what type of movie the message the quality in which it was said etcetera etcetera
and then after the movie talk about what happens and educate them around this type of movie the message the quality with which it was made and so on and so on
and after the movie mention all that happened and educate them regarding the type of movie the message the quality with which it unfolded etc etc
no yes
no yes
no yes
no yes
because the restrictions that they put well like you said there is too much violence that can be found in cartoons
because the restrictions that they place well like you said there is a lot of violence in the cartoon
because the restrictions they place man like you say there is violence that is eh in cartoons
because the restrictions that they put well many like you say there is violence that is in a cartoon
there are cartoons that are made for children and has exaggerated violence not
there is cartoons that are for all children and there are some that have exaggerated violence
there are cartoons that are for kids and they have an exaggerated violence no
there are cartoons that are for all the kids and have too much violence right
yeah exactly and in the in the in general i think that that eighty percent of the movies are bad that you must not see them
yes exactly and in general i think that eighty percent of the movies are so bad that they shouldn't be seen
aha exactly and the and in the and in general i think that eighty per cent of the movies are so bad that you shouldn't watch them
sure exactly and in those and in it and in general it seems to me that 80 of the movies are so bad that one should not watch them
no and of the other maybe some are medium and less than five percent are worth watching
yes and the others well at least some are in the middle and some less than fifty percent are worth seeing
no and of the other well maybe some are mediocre and less that five per cent are worth watching
no and as for the others well the best ones are mediocre and less than 5 are worth seeing
no but with those you have enough to have an an idea of that it is what you must be looking for right
no well with those there is enough to have an idea of what there is to search for no
no but with those you have enough to have a an idea of what is what you're looking for no
right but with these one already has a sufficient idea to have an idea of what there is to go looking
there are enough it does not mean that not enough movies are not made but so many are made you don't have to see them all
yes there is enough i don't want to say that there isn't enough movies but there are so many that we don't have to see all of them it's it's
there is enough it doesn't mean that they don't make enough movies but they make so many that you don't have to go and watch all of them it's it's
if there are enough one doesn't want to day that there are not enough movies but they do so many that there is no need to go to see all of them it's it's
right and then
no and then
no and then
no and then
yeah we try for example like knowing who they are before we go to a movie
if we got to know for example of who they before going to see a movie
if we try for example to eh know who they are before going to a movie to inform ourselves
if we would take the care of investigating who they are before going to watch a movie
about the critics towards that movie and then we go
over that girl in the movie and over it then we go
about the critics about that movie and then we go
read the reviews about that movie and then go watch one
its that's what we always look for we go to see this movie
is not that is what we always try that we see the movie
that's not that's what we try to do when we go to watch this movie
it's like that's what we always try to do when we go out to watch a movie
yeah
aha
aha
uhhuh
and we've already made a decision about what movies and since my kids were little they've had that education because he like the movies a lot my wife and i love the movies so
we already made a decision over what movies and from my sons had from early they had that education because we like going see a movie to a cinema then
we already have made a decision about the movies and since my children since they were small they have they have had and education because we really like the movies my wife and i love the movies so
and we have made a decision about which movies my kids since they were young they've been educated because my wife and i we love movies so
never even when they were when they were little
never even when they were like smaller
never even when we were they were little
even when we were when they were younger
if there was a movie sometimes we took them even if it was for older people right
if we had some movie sometimes we took the with us even if it was for adult only no
if there was a movie sometimes we would take them even if it was for and older age than theirs no
we would take them to watch movies even if they were movies for grown ups
and yeah maybe there could be some scenes a little stronger but one scene doesn't necessarily make the movie
and yes they could see some scenes not too strong but the scene doesn't make the movie necesarily
and they could see some scenes no stronger but a scene doesn't necessarily make up the whole movie
and they would watch some scenes strong ones but a scene doesn't necessarily make a whole movie
so we tried to talk about the message Âright for example a lot of war movies Âright
then we tried talking about the message for example not too many war movies no
then we tried to talk about the message no for example many war movies no
so we would try to speak about the message no for example lots of war movies
a lot of war movies are for example saving private
lots of was movie for example are respecting the soldier
many war movies are for example respecting the soldi
lots of war movies are respecting the soldier's
ah yes
aha ah
aha ah

more like that they are the pg the pg than the pg thirteen i have noticed
more like pg pg pg13 i've noticed that
more like those that are they are like pg pg13 i've noticed
then i don't understand a lot of that
then well i don't understand much about that
so i don't really understand it
so i really don't understand much of this
ok
aha
yeah
aha
ok
aha
yeah
aha

yes it's true
yes yes it is true
yes

oh it's a pleasure juan
oh nice to meet you juan
oh nice to meet you juan
oh nice to meet you juan
so he's just about to turn two years old and yes as a matter of fact i'm concerned about that what we do well my husband more than anything
then he barely is going to be two years old and yes the truth that worries me what we do well my husband more than anything
then he's just a little under 2 years old and i am worried about what we do well my husband more than anything
then he is about to turn two years old and the truth it worries me what we do well my husband more than anything
for example he if we watch a movie and we really love it we love it if it's pg or pg 13
he for example if we see some movie and we really love it we like the movie for example if it is_pg or pg thirteen
for example if we watch a movie and we love to do that we like the movie if it's pg or pg13
he for example if we see some movie and the truth we love it we like the movie for example if it is pg or pg thirteen
what we watch the most we don't really like neither him nor myself to watch adult movies or those that
this is what we see the most we don't really like it we dont like adult movies
which is what most see we do not really like him or his adult movies
what is what we most watch we don't really like neither he nor me like to watch adult movies so
up to pg13
so pg thirteen
it's pc13
as far as pg thirteen
those or at times one that is r but the truth is that i don't pay attention for example if there is a movie that we like
maybe once in a while rated r but it actually doesn't get my attention for example if there is one we like
it's like this sometimes but the truth strikes us if there is a movie that we like
well sometimes one r but it really doesn't get our attention but for example if there is a movie that we like
we buy it and we have for example sometimes it has nude scenes or something like that my husband grabs the movie and erases that part
we buy it and it has for example naked scenes of people and my husband hates that so he skips that part
sometimes we buy it and it has some nude scenes in it i grab my husband and he deletes that part
we buy it and you have for example sometimes it has some nude scenes and that mi husband plays the movie and deletes that part
and we do it mostly because for example there are times when neither my husband nor me are going to be there so then the children might grab the movie and could watch it
so he does it so he can show us that we shouldn't watch that stuff cause the kids could grab the movie and watch it themselves
and what makes it more important that neither my husband and i are going to keep it is because the kids can get a hold of the movie and see it
and he does it when for example sometimes neither him nor me will be at home so the kids can take he movie and watch it
so for that my husband will record some commercial or other thing
and then my husband would film a commercial or something like that
and my husband is going to burn the commercial or something
and the my husband is going to record a commercial or something
then really they can watch the movie but they are not going to see well at the best it will be purely cars or action
so really there could be a movie about cars or action
then you can really watch the movie because you will not see better pure truck action
then they can really watch the movie because there is not going to be better they can see movies about cars or full action
but for example if you take away or erase the part that is a bit pornographic because you see that always even though it's a good movie it always has to have some nudity
but for example he skips it he skips the pornographic part because there is always a naked person in every good movie
but for example you just delete the part that has a little pornography because the movie is a good but it has some nude time
but for example he takes he deleted a part that was a little pornographic because you know that even if it's a good movie there's always a nude scene
excuse me
from where what
where from excuse me
from where you mean
at times it has nothing to do with it but
and sometimes there's nothing to watch
and sometimes it has nothing to do with it
and sometimes it's not related because
we have movies that are action or cars and suddenly up comes something that has nothing to do with that but
we have action movied about cars and out of nowhere there's a scene that has nothing to do with it
we have movies that have cars and action and suddenly something happens that has nothing to do with it
we have cars and action movies and suddenly it shows something that up and that's not related but
so then that is what we've done because we are going to have other children and once in a while they will be alone and we don't have to worry that they are going to watch a movie then
so that's what he does cause we are going to have more kids so when they're alone we can be ok and relaxed cause they wont watch those movies
then we will have to wait because we have other children then so we have to be sure that we're alone before we can see the movie
so that is what he has done because we are going to have other kids and sometimes they will be by themselves and then we can be sure that if they watch a movie
there will be no problem but
there won't be a problem but
no there won't be a problem but
there won't be a problem but
yes
yes
yes
yes
yeah
yes
yes
aha
oh yes because it really
yes because in reality
eh yes because really
ehm yes because it really
yes
yes
yes
yes

yes
no yes
no yes
no yes
no yes
ah i'm here in the state of idaho
eh i am here in the state of idaho
ah i'm here in idaho
ah i'm here in the the states in idaho
yeah oh yes besides for example we have found movies that are for children or rather they are not for children but when
yes y apart for example we have found movies that are this for kids or in other words are not from kids but to see are
yes no yes in part for example we have found movies that are for that are for children these aren't for children but to see
aha no y and besides that for example we have found movies that are for em for children that is ehm they are not about children but to see they are
showing the ones that supposedly are pgthrirteen that is for children of thirteen years of age that can see it then but sometimes they say like you say vocabulary and sometimes they show scenes that
passing from the rating for kids which is of course pg13 which is for kids that are thirteen years old that they can watch but sometimes they says like you say vocabulary and sometimes scenes occur
passing for the children that are supposedly pg thirteen that are for children of thirteen years that can see them well the vocabulary and sometimes there are scenes
going from the one for children that is ehm supposedly the pg thirteen that is for children that are thirteen years old that can see them then but sometimes they say like you sa vocabulary and sometimes they air scenes
of nudity and that so then i say since they will be watching well
of nudity and stuff so i say good
of nudity and so i say it is like they are seeing well
of nudity and that then i say ah how is he going to is seeing well
i don't know i am i am mexican
i don't know i am mexican
i don't know i am mexican
i don't know i am i am mexican
that and really there for example yet ah still on television they care of you and still on movies they still care of you a bit
this and really there for example television still takes some care and even in the movies they the care themselves a little bit
still for example on the television they protect you also in the movies they still protect you a bit
then and really there for example even ah like still in the television they care about you and even at the movies they care about you like a little of that
i say ah i don't know i don't know it makes me
but i think well i don't know it becomes really
but i say um i don't know i don't know its very
but i say ah i don´t know it does not look to me very

sometimes it does not say anything because sometimes for example is says
sometimes they don't tell you anything because sometimes it tells you
no sometimes they don't tell you anything because sometimes for example they say
not sometimes it does not tell you a thing because sometimes for example it says
and and it changes for example and when you are watching it bang it's is different to what it told you
and changes your things and when you're watching well it's different what is saying
and they change for example the things and when you are already seeing it is different from what they said
and and for example changes things and when you are already watching it is is different at what it says
oh yes for example it says something like  it has too much violence and then it's not that violent or sometimes it is or not no it doesn't clearly state the information
oh yes for example she says that it's not too violent at times it's not too violent simply not sometimes she doesn't doesn't really give the information
oh for example it ways that is really violent sometimes it isn't that violent it doesn't provide the real information
oh yes for example he says it's too violent sometimes it's not so violent it simply no no sometimes it doesn't really give you the information
so sometimes
so sometimes not
so sometimes doesn't
then sometimes it doesn't
you don't even pay attention to it because for example
and one doesn't even pay attention better because because no and those for example
not even myself put attention because of those examples
then sometimes you don't listen to it because because no and those for example
those things that they sell for example to sell tv sets that that you see
those am things that they sell for example to sell on the television devises that that already see that this
those things they sell for example those commercials on television
those things they sell for example they sell for television sets that that you see that
that they remove or block bad words and stuff like that those work sometimes but they don't all the time they work but let's say well i don't really own one
that take out the swear words or things like that and sometimes they don't work but sometimes they don't don't work very well let's say i rea well i really don't have one
they remove all the bad words on tv sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't well i don't have one really
that remove the swear words or things like that well sometimes they work and sometimes they don't really work well i really don't have one
but one of my friends does and she says they don't work they don't work properly because they sometimes block words that are not that bad they are not really bad words and then really cuss words are not blocked
but i have a friend that has one and really she says that it hasn't hasn't worked very well because sometimes it blocks swear words that ah words that are not so rude and it leaves swear words
but i have a friend with one of those things and she says sometimes it works but other times removes words it should not remove and leave the really bad words
but i have a friend who has one and she says it really hasn't worked properly because sometimes it covers up the words words that are not curses and leaves the curses there
wow a little far away
wow a little far
wow a little far away
wow that's a little far
so uff
so uf
so
then uf
aha
aha
yes
yeah
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes yes
yes yes
yes yes
yes yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes you see that's true that's a great idea i remember when my mom would watch a movie with me and we would always watch movies after ten in the evening because
yes that's true that's a better idea i remember that my mom when we watched a movie we didn't see a movie after 10 pm because
yes notice that it is true that is the best idea that i remember of my mom when we would watch a movie anyways we didn't see a movie after ten at night because
yes look it's true that's a better idea i remember that my mom when we watched a movie as well we didn't watch a movie after ten at night because
we knew that we were always going to find
we knew what we could find
we knew that we would be able to find
we already knew that we could find
or my mom would take a chance to try and get ugly movies
or my mom would take the risk of finding an ugly movie
or my mom would risk seeing bad movies
or my mom risked finding ugly movies
yeah yeah well you see we got the subject of movies
yes yes well you see that they have placed us you see that we have the subject of movies
yes yes well you see we have to speak about movies
yes yes well i see we have well you see we have to touch on the theme of movies
the ones that are not made for children but for example she would say i don't know if they were airing a movie that had bad language
the kind that's not suitable for children but for example sometimes she said i don't know they were showing a movie and it had one or two curse words
of the type that is not appropriate for some kids but for example sometimes she would say they wouldn't show a movie and i don't know any other one then some vulgar thing
of the type that it's no longer suitable for some kids but for example sometimes she said i don't know they played a movie and i don't know one or two curses
or something different than nudity but still like with little clothes on or when we were kids for example my mom would say
or something else that's no so much about nudity but just the same little clothing for example and when we were little for example my mom
or something that is not as naked but it is the same for example small amounts of clothing and when we were girls for example my mom
or something that isn't so nude but still for example few clothes and when we were little for example my mom
you can watch it and then you will understand more and she would say
no daughter soon you'll understand better she said
no daughter well you guys will already understand more and she would tell us
no daughter well soon you will understand more and she told us
that because when you say  turn around look away you are not supposed to see that it's like you are telling them to do so the teenagers will do it because they are wondering why their mom told them not to watch
because if you say no turn around no no you must not see that then a teenager or a kid will start thinking ah but why won't mom let me see that
because anyways if one says to not turn around you shouldn't see that then like to an adolescent or to a child it will begin to sink in and but why doesn't my mom let me
because also as well then if one says no turn around no no you shouldn't watch that like then a a teenager or a kid starts to ah but why doesn't my mom let me
if the movie is playing on television they are wondering why they can't watch it why they are not allowed to
if it's a movie in the house and i'm going to watch it why didn't mom didn't mom let me see that part
if it is a movie of the house and i am going to see because my mom doesn't let me see that part
if it's a movie in the house and i'm going to watch because my mom didn't didn't let me watch that part
so i don't think yes yes
then i think not yes yes
so then i think not yes yes
then i think that no yes yes

well i don't about the ratings i don't understand a lot i know that there are movies that are pg thirteen pg
well i have i those ratings i don't i don't understand very well i know that there are movies that are pg thirteen pg
well i really don't know much about movie classification i don't really understand it i know that there are some movies that are pg13 pg

yea
yes
aha
sure
oh yes and that is not and are shown during the day true
and yes and that is in plain day the truth
uh yes and that is not so much in the light of day really

always keeping an eye on what they watch i don't want her to watch programs that uh will give her nightmares or will give her bad ah motivations but there are a lot
always here paying attention of what they watch in i don't want her to watch programs that eh that would give her nightmares or bad ah motivations but there are many
always here aware of what she watches i don't want her to see programs that that will give her nightmares or bad ah motivations but there are many
is always paying attention to what i watch and i don't want her to see programs that eh that are going to giver her nightmares or bad ah motivations but yes there is a lot
of permissive things also in the for example the movies out there well every time are i now think that it's more violent i don't know if
many permissive things too in the fore example the movies outside well more and more they are i now think that it's more violent i don't know if
many permissive things also like for example the movies out well each time are more i think now they are move violent i don't know if
a lot of permissive things on the for example movies from outside because each time they are i now think it is more violent i don't know if
enough to classify because they are making very violent movies with lots of topics
it's enough to rate it because they're making very violent movies about many subjects
already sufficient in order to classify it because violent movies with many themes come out
it's already sufficient for classifying it as they are leaving good violent movies with many themes
yes
yes
yes
yes
sure
sure
clearly
i understand
sure
sure
clearly
i understand
like the movie that is well the allies about the iraq war that i believe is about the experience the soldiers are having
like that movie that's the one about the war in iraq that i think it's about soldiers that the experience they're going through
like that movie that is allied it already came out of the war in iraq and i believe it's about the soldiers that their experience
like that movie that was about allies that left the war in iraq that thought that the soldiers that experienced it had left
this one with the colored actor his name is jamie i think it is jamie foxx
with that africanamerican actor jamie what'shisname i think jamie foxx
there is this actor of color jamie he's called i think jamie foxx
it's about the black actor named jamie i think jamie foxx
and then there's is another white boy that looks like eh is traumatized or something when he is experimenting in irak those things are very real and they happen every day there
and then you have this other white kid who is traumatized or something when he's in his experience and in irak those things are very real they happen everyday over there
and so there is another white guy that seems is traumatized or something when he is in his experience in iraq those things are very real and that happens there every day
and while this other while guy thought that he was traumatized or something with his experiences in iraq these things are very real and happen all the time
and yes true
yes true
and yes true
yes i'm sure
joe
joe
joe
joe
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes transfering many things from outside of the lie he told in order to invade iraq that is really ah now one looks and really no no
yes transferring many things outside the lie he said to invade irak that's really uh now that you look at it it really is not
yes transferring many things outside of the lie that he told in order to invade iraq which is really now that one looks at it well really
yes they were transferring many things out of the life that they told to invade iraq as being real ah now that one lie was not real
it is not worthy to do that more than one thousand soldiers already died
it wasn't worth it doing that more than two thousand soldiers have died during all that
it is not worth having done that and already two thousand soldiers have died
it's not worth what was done it has already killed more than two thousand soldiers
yes it's true
yes it is true
yes it's true
yes that's true
yes it's true so i i think that movie classification today is rather relative i know they have from thirteen they clearly know that x are
yes it is true well i i think that the thing about the classifications nowadays is very relative i know that they have from thirteen they know clearly that the x are
yes it's true well i think that classifications now are really relative i know they have from pg13 the have the r rated which
yes that's true well i i think that the current classification system is relative i know that kids of around thirteen years old they know what xrated movies are
obvious true but i think that r these days is well beyond what is permitted or not eh eh that i agree with
obvious right but ehm i think that the r or those days it is very stretched what is allowed or not ehm ehm i agree that
are obvious right but i think that the r rating is not very well defined about they can or can't have i agree that
right that's pretty obvious but this i think that nowadays they are stretching what is allowed and what is not eh eh i agree with the fact that
allot of movies true that don't make sense for example you have a lot of gang movies that are gangs with lots of gangsters are the ones you see because like
many movies right that don't make any sense for example there are many movies about gang members that that the gang members many gang members are the ones that go to see it because since
many movies right don't make any sense for example there are many gangster movies so many of the real gangster go and watch it because they
lots of movies right they don't have a sense of many of them are about gangs about lots of gangs or gang members and they go to watch them because it's like
they need to see the violence
need to see the violence
need to see violence
they need to watch that kind of violence
yes very bad
yes they are very bad
yes really bad
yes they are pretty bad movies
and it glorifies it someway
and like it glorifies in a certain way
and glorifies it in a way
and they kind of glorify it in a way
yes and what if your name
yes and what's your name
yes and what's your name
yes and what is your name
and that isn't for selling to
and that is not to sell to
and that is not for sale
and that shouldn't be used as a way to sell
yes that's why i see sometimes you boys copying that in the way they dress or walk and even talk or co because those are their heroes
yes that is why i see sometimes young kids like that replicating the way in which the dress or or how the walk or how they express themselves or ho because those are their hero
because some younger boys start dressing the same or walking of talking the same they watch because it's like a hero
so that's why i think that those young kids are copying those ways of dressing or walking or expressing themselves it's like they've become their heroes
and that isn't right that is is corrupting the young tose shows and movies teach them the fake values and isn't right but the
and that is not right that ehm corrupts youth those programs those movies teach fa false values and and that is not right but also
that's not right it corrupts the young people those programs those movies they teach wrong values and that is not good but also
and that's so wrong that's destroying our young people those shows those movies they teach them false values it's so wrong but our
society the parents the family has a lot to do to make them understand those things and how to treat them true i to my daughter i don't when
the society the parents the family has a lot to do in helping the children to understand those things and and how to send them right and i with my daughter i do not when
society parents families they have a lot of the work in helping children to understand those things right my kid when she
society the parents families they have a lot to do with it they should help the children understand what those things are and how to avoid them right i talk to my girl and i don't when
i see something and i don't what her to see it i don't like i don't force here in such a manner diji saying okay don't watch that
i am watching something yes i don't want her to see something i no eh and that is i do not force it in a way saye saying okay do not watch that
when i'm watching something like that if i don't want i mean i don't force it in that ways saying like okay don't watch that
when i watch something like that i don't want her to see i don't eh i mean i try in a way to say okay don't watch that
or if not i try in an educational way to teach her why this program is not good for her instead of imposing it by force in other words
or rather that i try to teach her in an educative manner because it's not good for her to be this program instead of forcing it upon her in other words
or i try in a educational way to teach her why this show isn't good for her instead of forcing her en other words
or i try to teach them in a very educative way why it is not good for her to watch that show so instead of trying to force it upon her in other words

well it's like that for the youth they become mentally accustomed to that being acceptable but back when i was growing up if they would have shown those things it would have caused an uproar
well what it does is that the adolescent brain gets used to seeing those things as it grows these things are learned and it has caused chaos
well like it is eh for young people their mind gets used to seeing that like it is acceptable but at the time when i was growing up those things were taught and would have caused chaos
in fact it wouldn't have been allowed at all but it's true times are changing and that's why young people are influenced by it
in fact they wouldn't have even permitted it at all but it's true that people's attitudes are changing and that that's why the youth have such an immense influence
in fact it wasn't permitted in all cases but it is true the mentality is changing and because of this eh the youth have a great influence
in fact it wouldn't have been permitted at all but it is true the mentality is changing and because of that eh young people have a great deal of influence

not because of the classifications so it is the job of each mom and dad to control the television that their kids are going to watch and not blame the classifications
and not according to the censor labels it's job each father and mother to make sure the television that the children are going to watch is protected and not just to blame the censor categories
not because ratings then is the work of each mom and dad to control what their children are watching is not fair to blame the classifications
it's not because of the rates so it's a parent's job every mom and dad must decide which shows their kids are able to watch and they can't put the blame on the classifications

including now i didn't have any inconvenient here eh including with some venezuela people
i have even had a several problems here eh with even with with venezuelans
so i've even had some problems here with people from venezuela
even now i have had a several inconveniences here eh with even with with venezuelans
eh people that have lots of years here and lack the knowledge about what really happens there
eh people that have been here many years and that don't know what is really happening in venezuela
ah people that have been living here for a long time and they don't know what's really going on in venezuela
eh people who have been here many years and do not know what is really happening in venezuela
and besides that they are afraid of the idea that they have been slfd that communism that i don't know what that fidel and that this and that and
and besides that they're afraid of the idea they've been sold communism and i don't know what about fidel and this and that
and apart from that they are afraid of the idea that they have been sold that communism that i don't know how long fidel and that and the other
besides that they are afraid of the agreed idea what communism that i don't know how much fidel and that and the other and
well i really don't know how how much knowledge you have but ehm for example the situation that we are living in venezuela is a very special situation
well i really don't know how how much you know but uh for example the situation we're living in venezuela is a very special situation
well i don't know really you have so much knowledge but for example the situation that we are living in venezuela is very special
well really i don't know how much knowledge do you have but this one for example the situation we are living in venezuela is a very especial situation
very distinct to venezuela that is that it doesn't have anything to do with the cuban reality with what happened in cuba ehm how i know i know they
very specific of venezuela i mean it doesn't have anything to do with the cuban reality with what happened in cuba like they
very peculiar for venezuela nothing to do with the cuban reality with what happened in cuba they had to
my own venezuela either way it has nothing to do with the cuban reality whit what happened in this cuba is how it is they are
had to adopt that system eh which were the necessities that got them to assume that system and and what happened during the time in which
they had to adopt that system eh what were the needs that made them adopt that system and and what happened during the time they
adopt that system eh which necessities forced them to assume that system and what happened during the time in
they had to adopt that system ah what were the needs that carried them to undertake that system and what happened during the time in which
ehm they were applying that because evidently there were mistakes in everything like we also have mistakes right now
hmm they were applying that because evidently there were mistakes as they are in everything as we have mistakes now too
which they were applying that because there were mistakes like with everything else as we have also made some mistakes right now
this they were applying because evidently they were mistakes as in all things just as we have mistakes right now
we have been making mistakes however well it is being work on function of that like the president says well ehm clearly he has a claim against
we've been making mistakes however well we're working on that as the president says well clearly he has a report against
we have been making mistakes but we are working on that as the president says he has a complain against the
we have been making mistakes however for we are working based on that as the president says this clearly has a complaint against
the government not against the the country but against the government from here that that they are the ones that they
the government not against the country but against the government here who are the
government not against the country but against the governmet from here they are the ones
the government not against the country but against the government here that are the one that
ay my dear mother because i am from venezuela
oh dear mother because i am from venezuela
oh dear because i'm from venezuela
ay dear girl because i'm from venezuela
well they assume some politics how would you say how would you say it best arbitrarily ehm
they assume a policy as they see fit as they see fit arbitrarily
who assume the policies that they want as they want arbitrarily eh
for they assume policies as it seems to them as best as it seems arbitrarily ah
exactly
exactly
exactly
exactly
exactly correct that is and if not then i extort you you you
exactly right i mean and if you don't then i'll blackmail you
exactly correctly so and if not i blackmail you
exactly right or if not then i'll i'll bribe you
aha then wow ehm
aha then wow eh
aha then wow eh
yeah then wow ah
exactly exactly so it is a situation rather
exactly exactly it's a very
exactly exactly it is a very very situation
right right then this a situation that is highly
delicate but i believe and from what i have seen that the north american town is waking up in some way i feel
due the things i've seen i think that america is somehow awakening
delicate but i believe and from what i have seen i feel that north americans like in some way are like waking up i feel
delicate but i believe and from what i've seen the north american community is waking up in some way i feel
and there are a bit more people that are realizing what is really happening because they have them like in a bubble
that there are more people noticing what is happening because it is like they were inside a bubble
that there are a few more people that are like realising what is really happening because also they're kept like in a bubble
that there is a little more people that are realizing what is really going on because they also had them in a bubble
yes
yes
yes
yes
clearly
right
you're right
sure
clearly
right
you're right
sure
where are you from
where are you from
where are you from
where are you from
some labels continue bad ones in passing
um bad labels
yeah labels follow and bad ones too
hm labeling continues and bad ones by the way
correct
right
that's right
correct
exactly that is what they sometimes say to me what are you doing here
right that what they say to me sometimes what are you doing here
exactly that's what they say to me sometimes  what are you doing here
exactly that is what they tell me sometimes  what are you doing here
i say to him look i could be in venezuela and not support the president or the fact that you are in a
i say look if i could be in venezuela and not to be with the president like the fact that you are in a
i tell them look i could be in venezuela and not support the president i mean the fact that you are in
and i say look i could be in venezuela and not support that president or the fact that you are in a
country or not or you fled your country does not imply that you have a position
country or no like if you left your country that doesn't mean you have a political position
country or not i mean if you left your country that doesn't mean that you're taking a position
country or not or you leave your country does not imply you have a position
nobody knows the reason for the people being here
no one knows the reason why people is here
nobody knows the reasons for the people to be there
no one knows the reasons for those people being here
en eh in the opportune moment but that has nothing to do with the opposition because how many people for example in venezuela they don't live in venezuela and what they are doing is throwing them the enema
in uh at any given time but that has nothing to do with the opposition because for example how many venezuelan people don't live in venezuela and what they're doing it's bashing
in eh at some point nothing to do with the opposition because how many people in venezuela do not live in venezuela and what they are doing is complaining
eh at a certain moment but that has nothing to do with the opposition because how many people for example in venezuela don't live in venezuela and what they really do is put them some enema
to the venezuelan government and the town
the people and the venezuelan government
to the venezuelan government and the people
to venezuelan government and their people
well that you don't have to be here or there to support or not support well it is a position to me when they tell me that it makes me laugh
i mean that you don't have to be here or there to be supportive or to not be supportive i mean that position is very uh i when they tell me that i laugh a lot
so so don't have to be here or there to support or not to support so it is a very very it makes me laught when they tell me that
right so you don't have to be here or there to support or not like it's a position very um to me when they tell me that way i get a good laugh
because what do they do here and well it may be the same thing you are doing thank god that you are here and not in venezuela
because why are you here and well maybe you would do the same thank god that you're here not in venezuela
because what are you doing here and well same as you thank goodness you are here no in venezuela
because what do you do over here all right could be same as you thank god you being here and not in venezuela
oh ok
oh okay
oh okay
ah okay
correct correct no well with all the gasoline problems that have really been well look
right right no look the whole problem is the gas that's been really but look
correct correct rightlook with all the problem about the petrol that is has been but look
right correctly no you could look at the gas prices problem like it truly was but look
in a surprising manner that the people can not eh no they don't protest i say my god but what happens what happens with these people well
outstandingly high that people can not uh they don't protest i say oh my god but what's wrong with these people i mean
in a susprisingly big way the people can not take it anymore but they don't protest and i say my gd but what happens with the people so
for really unusual high price the people can't cope with that they don't protest either and i say my god what's happening with all those people like
supposedly to you when it affects your wallet is when you react but it looks like no i don't know what happens or they change their car and they buy a more economic car i don't know
you're supposed to you react when it's affecting your pocket but it seems like it isn't i don't know what's going on or or they change cars and buy more economic one i don't know
supposedly when it affects your pocket then you react but it doesn't seem like that i don't knows what is happening do they change cars and buy a more economic onei don't know
supposedly you only react when your pocket is affected but it seemed like no i don't know what happens they must have been changing cars to get a more economic one don't know
i don't know what happens but they don't have in general they don't have that necessity to protest under certain things
i don't know what's going on but they don't have i mean generally they don't have the need to protest about some things
i don't know what happens but they don't have in general they don't have that need to protest on some issues
i don't know what happens but they don't have like in general the necessity to protest before certain things

i feel like they are rejecting of the the actual president and and like they are seeing that the things are not being painted to him because
i feel like they are rejecting policies the policies from our current president and they are looking at things the wrong way they are presenting them to them like
i feel that they are rejecting the policies of of of the current president and like they are seeing that really things are not how they are painting them to be because

fault of what our government does

then before i also used to see the americans like that like gringos well eh thst i understood that they are americans unites states citizens because this is another concept they work no then
then before i also see to americans like the gringos now i understand that no they are americans that are from usa because that is another wrong concept that is handles isn't then
so i would also look at american people and would treat them badly but now i have understood that they are not to blame and that they are people from the united states they are not americans that's a badly understood term isn't it so
then i also before saw the americans like gringos then this one now i understand that don't that they are americans and united states because that is another wrong concept they manage no then
well we are also americans if it comes to that
well we also are americans if the case we go

and then when after that it starts to reflect a little and no no they aren't americas is the government policy that well what they do is
and and so i started to think of that and no no they are not north americans no it's the government oh well they do
and then when i start thinking a bit and no no they're not the not northamericans no is the politic of the government yeah right what they do
they decide then we sure it reflects against the town against the country
they decide do then sure is reflecting against the people against the country
they decide they do so sure it does reflect the people of the country
they decide do then you like you reflect it against you people and you country
but that is like that is the political state of goverment
but it doesn't like that is the state is te policy of the government
but it's not like that the state it's the politics the government

but said yes then i'n not going to marry her i'm going to go with her and i'm going to get to know her and and up to there in return then i think i was the one that built my hopes up for that
but i said yes well i'm not gon na marry her i'll just hang with her and meet her and that's it instead well i think i was the one who made illusions about that
he said yes well i won't marry her i will date her and i will get to meet her and that's all but i think i was the one that had a lot of hope on that
and yes to tell you the truth yes it hurts
and this yes yes it hurts the truth
and yeah it really hurts
yes that hurts really
eh yes it hurts because i think you are excited and have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and tells you no well
eh yes it hurts because i think that you are excited and you have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and tells you no then now
er yes it hurts because i think that you're excited and you have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and says'no' well it just
yes it hurts because i think that you are all excited and have lots of faith in this relationship and when someone comes and rejects you well you
ay no no eh i don't know but i know that she is honduranean as well
ay no don't eh know but i know that she is also honduran
ah no no eh i don't know but i know that she is honduran too
ay no no i don't know but i know that she is also from honduras
but i think that it must it must hurt a lot more when you already live together like in a marriage
but i think that it must it must hurt much more when you are already living together with the person as in marriage
but i think there must be it must hurt a lot more when you're living with that person as a marriage
i think that it must hurt a lot more when you are already living with that person like in a marriage
i think it must be the worst experience i think of your life yes and i hope i hope to never go through it because we never know right
i think that it has to be the worst experience i think of your life it's yes and i hope i hope it never happens because we don't know right
i thing that must be the worst experience i think of your life yes and i hope i hope i never have it because we don't know right
i think that must be one of the worse i think experiences yes i hope i hope i never have to go through that cause we don't know right
so i hope to never go through that up to now i've been married three years and everything is working wonderfully but everything is fine
then i hope it never happens even right now i have three years of marriage and everything is working then not wonderfully but everything is fine
then i hope i never until now i've been married for three years and everything is working well not perfect but everything's fine
so i hope that i never so far i've been married for three years and everything is going on well but it's all so
a lot of communication and things like that
a lot of communication and things like that
a lot of communication and stuff like that
lots of communication and things like that

yes
yes
yes it is
yes is
yes she is
yes it is
so it is
that's the way it is
that's it
that's it
yes the truth i feel i think that it has to be something of the truth eh very difficult eh to keep it so everything is happy right but
yes the truth i think that it is something of the truth it is very difficult to maintain the appearance that everything is happy fine you know but
yes the truth me bein i think it has to be something for real eh very hard eh keeping it everything happy right but
yes the truth i fe i think it has to be some truth eh it's difficult eh keep all happy right but
and i think that also that and i think that eh when you take your engagement for example you can know and accordingly you go knowing the person
and i think also that and i also think that um when you have your relationship you can know and as such when you start know the person
and i think that also that and i think that huh when you're in your relationship for example you can know and as you meet the person
and i think that also and i think eh when you take your relationship for example you know and according you get to know the person
that of course you're not going to know thoroughly right until now you are married with that person but it's but i think that i think that
that really you won't know her very depths you know until you are married to that person but that but that i think that i think that
that of course you aren't meeting him profusely right until you're already married with that person but it's but i think that i think that
that of course you don't fully know right until you get married with that person but i think that i think
if you see that really you don't get along with that person and for example i have known people eh that they beat up their boyfriends being boyfriends they beat them and they abused and and they required them to everything that they wanted then
if you see that in reality you don't get along with that person and for example i have known people who have hit their girlfriends when they were boyfriend/girlfriend he would hit and treat them poorly and would obligate them to do what he wanted later
if you see that really you don't get on with that person and for example i've met people eh that hit their boyfriends being boyfriends they hit them and treated them bad and forced them to everything they wanted then
if you see that you don't gel along with the person for example i've met persons eh that hit their partners being partners they hit it and abuse them and force them to their will and then
i think that those relationships well nothing is going to come from nothing good because if they still aren't married
i think those relationships well they will never go anywhere good because if they haven't gotten married yet
i think this relationships are never going anywhere good because if they aren't married then
i think that those relationships will never get to a good place because if they are not married yet
and now they behave so imagine how it's going to be if they're goign to be married no but in a little bit they're going to say you are my owner so now
and they already treat them like imagine how it will be when they are married no but a little bit later they will say you are my owner and in that way
and they already treat them like that how is it going to be when they're married as soon they're going to say you're my owner
and they treat them that way imagine how it's going to be when they are married not so much they are going to say you are my owner and that
now like they treat her then i think that that a that those relationships eh i think that they're not going to work ever i don't know or or change him or
and how they treat you i think that those relationships um i think that they will not work i don't know or or he changes or
yeah how they treat them then i think that that one that those relationships eh i think they're never going to work i don't know or either he changes or
the way they already treat them i think that that one those relationships eh i don't think they are going to work ever i don't know or he changers or
or change or end a relationship like that i think that if it was a relationship like that well i i think that it doesn't have to hurt anything on the contrary of
or changes or that kind of relationship is over i think that if there was a relationship like that well i i think that it would not hurt at all on the contrary
or he changes or the relationship is over like that i think that if it is a relationship like that well i i think it shouldn't hurt at all on the contrary off
or changes or the relationship is over i think that a relationship that way then i think is not going to hurt at all the opposite
you have to think it over if you have a boyfriend that beats you or that
one should rest if one has a boyfriend that hits you or that
you should rest if you have a boyfriend that hits you or something
you have to rest if you have a boyfriend that hits you or that
i'm from mexico
i am from mexico
i'm from mexico
i am from mexico
you're going to rest you're going to say ah it's good we finished i don't know i thing that if for example everything starts doing it well and everything
you are going to rest you will say oh its good that we're done i don't know everything will be good and stuff
you are going to rest you are going to say ah that's great that we finished i don't know and i think that if for example everything starts to get along and all
you are going to rest you will say ay good that finished don't know and i believe that if for example everything starts to go good and all
everything is going well and suddenly someone i don't know must travel for example to another country or has to go to another school i think that that would hurt a bit
everything will be great and then somebody i don't know has to go for example to a different country or a different school i think it would hurt a little bit
everything is wonderfully and all of a sudden someone i don't know has go to for example to another country or needs to go to another school i think that there it would also hurt a little
everything is wonderful and all of a sudden someone don't know they need to go for example to another country or would have to go to another school i believe that there it would hurt a little
because everything is fine but only the third circumstances well they have to separate so i think that this type of relationships well that really really hurts but if it's a relationship that
because everything was good for certain circumstances i mean you don't have to separate so i think those kind of relationships well hurt its a kind of relationship that
because everything is fine but only for third circumstances since they must separate then i think that in that type of relationship well it does it does hurt but if it is a relationship like that that
because everything is fine but only for third circumstances well they need to seperate then i believe in this type of relations well yes yes it hurts but if it's relation then is
that they hit you and things like that no
that you get hurt and stuff so yeah
that they hit you and things like that then no
that they hit you abd things like that well no
that's true
that's right
that yes
that yes
aha
ha
aha
yeah
yes
yes
yes
yes
that's true
that's right
that is true
that yes
that's right yes it's true you're right because
that's right your right because
that yes yes yes true you are right because
that yes yes yes it's true you are right because
for example one time i was in while in mexico i met a girl that eh one time she came by with dark glasses to her jo to work
for example i ones in the state of mexico met a girl that um that came with black glasses to work
for example one time in when i was in mexico i met a girl that eh one time came with some black lenses to her jo job
for example me at one time while i was in mexico i met a girl that eh one time she came with black glasses to her trato work
from the city yes mexico city yes and
from the city yes mexico cityyes and
from the city yes from mexico city yes and
from the city mexico city yes and
and i told her and now you wear glasses was it a cloudy day right and she had a bruise that her boyfriend had made
and i told he what's with the glasses it was well the day was cloudy right and she had a bruise because her boyfriend hit her
and i told her and now you with glasses was cloudy the day really and she had a hit that her boyfriend did to her
and i told her now your wearing glasses and she had a black eye because her boyfriend hit her
and told her you should i told her i think that you should not i don't know i told her but i think that you must not allow your boyfriend to touch you
and i told her you know i told her i think you shouldn't let i don't know i told her but i think you shouldn't let your touch you
and i told her you should i told her i believe you can't allow i don't know i told her but i think you can't allow him to touch you
and i told her you know i think you shouldn't let yourself get touched by
because and she said well it is very difficult to end my relationship with him and i told her why and she said
your boyfriend because and she said  well it's just that it very it's very hard to me to break up with him and told her  why  and she said
your boyfriend and she said well it is it is too difficult to end the relationship with him and i told her why she says
your boyfriend because and she said it was to hard to finish their relationship and i asked why and she said
i still love him
in spite of everything i love him
in spite of everything i love him
even though things happen i love him
and then wow i told her what how can you love a person who beats you sometimes she used to come bruised and sometimes he
and then wow i told her what how can you possible love someone that hits you that hurts you sometimes she came uh bruised or sometimes
and then wow i gave what how can be possible that you love to some person that hits you that beats you sometimes she came eh bruised or sometimes eh
and then i said wow what how can you love a person that hits you she sometimes came with bruises or sometimes
used to smack her and similar things
that he slapped her or stuff like that
he gave her slaps or something like that
he smacked her things like that
therefore as sometimes you say those type of relationships are the hardest and finally when she managed to do it i remember that she used to cry and cry and cry
then like you said sometimes those kind of relationships are the toughest and when she finally did it i remember she was the one that cried and cried and cried every
then like you say sometimes that kink of relationships are the hardest and at the end when she could do it i remember that she was the one that cried and cried and cried any
like you said sometimes those kind of relationships are the hardest ones and when she finally did it she cried and cried everyday
every time that she could at every break and similar occasions because she missed him and all that therefore i think that yes somehow sometimes
every time she could she cried during breaks and stuff like that because she missed him and all that so i think so in a way sometimes uh
any time she could cry in the breaks and such things because she missed him and so on then i believe yes in some way sometimes eh
she cried during break and stuff like that because she missed and stuff so i think that yeah sometimes um
some relationships i think that i imagine that it was very painful for her
some relationship i think that well i imagine it was very painful to her
some relationships i believe that i imagine that to her was very painful
some relationships i think that for her was very hurtful
mm well good i've already passed that stage and i am married but for example ah mm well i don't know the experience that i had was was very difficult

there's nothing there's nothing it's true that there has to be a big big love that's why i'm telling you because i feel that in my relationship what was possible was love
there is nothing in fact there has to be love a great love i feel that my writing was posible because of the love
there isn't anything there isn't anything it really must be a great a great love that's why i say because i feel that in my relationship what could was love
theres no nothing nothing its true they have to speak something ture about love that's why i tell you i feel like my relationship what it was was love
because truthfully with a situation that was so difficult like we were living if there hadn't have been love it would have no we would have broken up just that simple because it just wouldn't have made any sense
in fact everything has to have love to get us out of the difficult situations
because to tell you the truth with a situation so so difficult like the one we live in if there wouldn't have been love right there there wouldn't have it no it would have ended as simple as that because it really did not make any sense
because the truth is with a difficult situation going on if there was no such thing as love nothing would have finished because there wouldn't be no sense
it doesn't make any sense to continue something that eh where's there no love well i feel that yes a lot of love and many of his promises that you were talking about to actually love
it makes no sense to continue something without love i feel that way there needs to be more love and less of that compromise you talked about
it didn't make sense to continue something that eh where there was no love so i feel that yes lots of love and a lot of that compromise that you talk about of loving for real
there wouldn't be sense in something like love so then i feel a lot a lot of love and a lot of compromise of what you're talking about
to be here because you want to be because it was worth it
to be there because you want and you know it's worth it
to be there because you want to because it is worth it
being there because you want too because its worth it

right then you know one is always hoping that it doesn't happen well i don't really know what really is going to happen but right it does cause trauma but poor son of mine because he is a teenager so
it happens at school so he feels really bad
it happens in school and then he feels really bad
it happens to him in school and then he feels very bad
it happens in school and he feels really bad
yes it is a heavy load it's a really heavy load for him
yes yes it's a stigma it's a stigma what he has no so
yes yes it is a stigma it is a stigma what he has no then
yes it's a stigma it's a stigma what he has no then

yeshey getting back at subject i think there must be a a good ones her
per se well getting back to the theme i believe that there should be some good ones here
well yes so to go back to the topic i think that he would owe a few good ones here
eh yes well returning to the subject i think he should try with some good
system of
system of uh
system of uhm
system of eh
oh
uh uh
ehm ehm
uh
yes
yes
yes
yes
we are not covered it is a problem because well something can always happen no
we are not covered is a problem because well something could always happen right
we are not covered that is a problem because something can happen at any time
we're not covered it's a problem because there's always something that could happen right

ah really
ah yea
oh really
ah yes
so everything is very well to which orientation are we going right in fact the place i went to precisely is called university system healthcare system or something like that but
well then everything is pretty good at the orientation that i went to where justifiably it is called university system healthcare system something like that
so then is all great to which orientation we go now well in fact where i went in fact is called university system a healthcare system something like that but
as well it is all good to which orientation do we go now because in fact where i went it is called university system healthcare system something like that but
then it's precisely there where they bounced me
so justifiably that is where they kicked me out
so then that's exactly where i got bounced
then just like that there is where they bounced me
i told him
i told him
i said
i told them
mm uh uh then they told me no you have to give us information i had a letter with my earnings and so on no
mm uh uh therefore they told me i needed to bring them information i had a letter from my admissions etc no
mm uh uh so then if they told me no well you have to bring us information i had a letter showing my income and so on right
mm uh uh then they told me no well you have to bring us information i had a letter about my income etc no
and him yes and the other day i went precisely i went to an ah office in which supposedly they gave you some type of i mean pension for
and he yes and just the other day i went to an uhm an office in which supposedly gave a type of or rather pension for
i know the other day i went to an office they supposedly give you something like a pension for
and the yeah and the other day i went precisely to a an office in which they supposedly give some kind of i mean pension for
but not that we need the social security of your employer and then that's when they didn't want to anymore
but that isn't we need the social security from your employer so that is when they just didn't want to
but not that we need the social security of your employer so then that's when they did not want to
but not that we need your employer's social security and then there was where they didn't want anymore
no but not me but well now i have my social security myself
no well i don't but well now i have my own social security my own
no well not me but well then now i have my social security myself
no wel not i but well then now i have my social security myself
yes employed
yes employee
yes employed
yes employed
well maybe i'll go
so anyway i'm going
well the same me
i go anyway

hello how are you my name is john
hello how are you mi name is juan
hy how are you my name is juan
hello how are you my name is juan
so more than once we said that belongs to the institution where you are no its more than a tool work
then more than than sometimes lets say that it is part of the institution where you are found no is more like a working tool
than the sometimes we say that belongs to the institution where you are no more like a job tool
well more than than sometimes let's say that it belongs to the institution in which you are no it is more a work tool
but that tool is very personal seems like a car no
but a very personal tool seems to the car no
but a more personal tool looks like is a car no
but a tool like very personal seems to be the car no
yes yes exactly besides as i'm here in texas
yes yes exactly also because i am here in texas
yes yes exactly besides i am here in texas
yes yes exactly besides like i am here in texas
i feel that the automobile culture here is like a reminiscence of the culture of the horses too
i feel that car culture here is kind of the way culture was also for horses in the days
i feel that the car culture here is like a culture reminicent of the horses also
i believe that here the car culture is something like a reminiscence of the horses culture also
no it is like a horse it is something like very very very personal very close
no it is like a horse it is something very personal very close
no is like a horse is something like very very very personal a close thing
no is like a horse it is something like very very very personal very closed
over the course of one's life here we take care of them and it's very important just like a horse from that time no
the life we have they take care of them here and it is as important as the horse was in that era
in our lives they take care of them here is as important as the come on as the horses at that time
to to your life here take care of them and the is as important as let't say as the horse at that time no
for some years yes because if they say no the devices that have to do with communication are the most important in our age like computers
some years ago and well if they do not say in our era of communication the most important elecronics are the ones that have to deal with communication and computer
for some years ago and well so if they not say so in our time of comunication most important devices are those that have to do with communication computer
some years ago and and well well if don't say so in our time of communication the most important devices are going to be the related with communication the computer
eh as permitted by the information management and everything no
eh what allows communications and all that no
eh as permitted the information management and all that thing no
eh everything that allows the handling of the information and everything right

i am in san antonio matt i think we have spoken before you are in philadelphia
i am in san antonio mateo i think he talked already you are in philadelphia
i'm in san antonio mateo i think we already talked you're in philadelphia
i am in san antonio mateo i think we had already talked you are in philadelphia
exactly and here the working people are like in those days like mules no they need a pickup truck
exactly and here the working people have like in those times a like a mule no need a pick up a truck pick up
exactly and here the working people have like as in those days a mule no they need one a pick up truck pick
exactly and here working people have like in that times like a mule no they need a a a pick up a truck pick up
pick up truck no give and do not leave if you notice like there's a work culture that's very very important
pick up truck no and go and give and for it not to leave yoy then it is you can tell like there is a culture for hard work very important
pick up truck no
pick up truck right and listen and it does not leave them then is eh it is evident like it is a hard work culture very very important
and the computers okay well in all houses there is television telephone and computers practically no but but like that there are other dimensions no of the technological question then the car seems to be
and the computers good well all the houses there is television telephone and computers practically no but but how are there other dimensions no of the technological question then the auto appears to be
and the computers well since practically there is there is television telephone and computers in all homes no but but like there are other dimensions no about the technological question then the car seems to be
and the computers well in every home there's television telephone and computers basically isn't it but but like there are other dimensions of the technological cuestion then the automobile seems to be
the most most important
of the most important
of the most important
of the most most important
ah what a what technical question technology is most important in your life what is that which we are discussing right now if it would have to be the car or it would have to be the computer what do you think
ah what what tecnological question is technology important in your life what is that we are discussing right now if it had to be the auto or if it had to be the computer what you do you opine
oh what what technical question technological is more important in your life that is what we are discussing right now if it would have to be the car or if it would have to be the computer what do you think
ah what a what technical technological question is more important in your life that's what we're discussing right now if it should be the automobile or the computer what do you think
uh huh exactly
aha exactly

you have your cellphone
you have your cellphone
you have your cell phone
having your cellphone
oh look its a placer talk with you again
ah look i ma glad to talk to you again
ah look nice talking to you again
ah look it is nice to talk with you again
yes notice that yes it's very important what you've just said a while ago when i worked i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important no
yes i notice that it is very important what you just said some time ago when i worked i had the type of job in which the computer was the most important no
yes look that yes that is very important what you have just said a long time ago when i worked i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important no
yes notice that it is it's verry important what you just said some time ago when i was working i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important thing was it
and well in the computer there were the messages always it was in the internet the mail more than the telephone neither cellphone nor anything no
and well the computer had the messages it always had internet email messaging more than the cellphone no cellphone nothing no
and well the messages were on the computer i was always on the internet the emails more than the phone neither cell phone nor anything no
and well on the computer were the messages there was always the internet the mails more than the phone the cellphone anything right
the computer was the most important
the computer was the most important
the computer was the most important
the computer was the most important
but now with the type of work that im realizing the auto is the most important the computer because the auto is what let you reeel type of work that im doing is more
but now with the kind of work that i'm doing the car it's the more important than the computer because the car let's me do the work i'm doing
but now with the kind of work that i'm doing the car is the most important the computer because the car is what lets you re th the kind of work that i'm doing is more
but now with the type of work that i am doing the car is the most important the computer because the car is what permits retype of job that i am doing
more physical no then the auto is converted in the ins in the apparatusmore important and the computer for a second diagram also is very important
more physical right then the care becomes the most important instrument and the computer well it goes to a second instance but it is also important right
more physical right then the car becomes the ins the more important device and the computer well is a second level even though it's also very important right
more phisical no then the car becomes the most important tool and the computer well in a second plan even though it is also very important no
but of course is by the type of good work
but it's because the kind of work
but well it is good for the kind of work
well it is because the type of work well
yes yes
yes yes
yes yes
yes yes
yes yes that yes
yes that's right
yeah yes it is
yes yes that yes
oh yes
oh really
oh yeah
ah yes
yes hm yes no maybe here yes for the distance that needs to go in the job the auto is fundamental
yes well here yes because the distance you have to drive to work the car is essential
yeah uh yeah no well here because the distances that you have to cover for work the car is fundamental
yes eh yes because of the distance i have to travel in my work the car is more fundamental
hey everything is fine what do you think about today theme
listen fine everything is fine what do you think about today's topic
listen here is all good what do you think about today's topic
listen well all good this what do you think about today's topic
but yes in in the city i think yes the most important and depends in the job also so hm maybe it can be a computer no then
but also in the city i think and the most import well according to the job it might be the computer right then
but yeah in in the city i think that yeah the most impor and depending on the work too well uh it could be the computer right then
but yes and in the city i believe the most imortant and depending on your work also well eh could be the computer no then
the the next question or or the apparatus of communicationno how you say the cellular and
the other question the communication electronics right the cellphone and
the the other question or or the communication devices right like you said the cell phone and
the the other question o o the tools of communication no like you say the cellular
and that and hm and the other question is if you consider that those hm these technologies will convert more into a problem than than in
and then the other question is if you consider that this technologies are more of a problem than of
and that uh and the other question is if you consider that those technologies turn into more of a problem than than in
and that and eh and the uestion is if you consider that you are eh this technology becomes more a problem then then in
well what type of problems would it have no like you just said with the car the problems that have to do with parking
we what type of problems can you have no as you just said with the car the problems that have to do with parking
alright what kind of problems he could have like you just said the only problems with the car could come from parking
well what kind of problems could he have right like you said with the car the problems that have to do with the parking
no here in texas there is not is not where i am there are no major problems no with parking there is a lot of space everywhere no it still does not have the
no here in texas no there is not where i am there are not many problems no with parking there is a lot of space everywhere no it hasn't presented yet
no here in texas we dont't especially where i am have that problem with the parking lots of open spaces didn't come up
no here in texas no there isn't where i'm from there is not major problems no with the parking there is a lot of space everywhere he hasn't presented
let's say those problems here but but in the end i don't know i don't know what you think above above everything i would say that well in regard to the care issues with cars and all of that well like it is not seen as a large problem unless it is
let's say those problems here but in the end i don't know i don't know what you think more more than anything i would say that well regarding cars car issues and ll that well you don't see a big problem unless that
we say those problems over here but anyway don't know what do you think more than anything i would say related to cars there isn't any overall big issue with them at least
lets say those problems here but in the end i don't know i don't know what your opinion is above everything i would say that well in regards with the cars matter of cars and all that well it doesn't look like a big problem unless
we could consider as a problem the interests created around the the auto industry and like sometimes they seem to affect the same technology development of the
we considered it like a problem interests created around around the car industry and how they sometimes appear to affect the same development of technology of
we could consider an issue the interest created around car industry and how they usually seem to affect the development of the technology of
we could consider a problem the interests created around the motor industry and like so sometimes they affect the growing of technology
of transport no for example
of transportation no for example

yes yes but yes
yes yes yes but yes
the theme is the technical devices i mean the technology the devices that you use more and you depend of them how do you consider these dependency
the topic is about thecnical devices i mean the technology the most used devices and how much do you depend on them and how you consider the dependency
the topic is about technical equipment like the technology the one you most use and depend on and yes how do you consider that dependency
the topic are technical gadgets i mean technology the gadgets you use the most and that you depend on then and if how do you consider that dependence
since
well
for
well
yes
yes
yes
yes
exactly yes well as they say as well with the auto industry no is the auto industry would have advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry maybe the car could transport us with
exactly yes but as they also say with the car industry no if the car industry had advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry perhaps cars could transport us with
exactly yes like they say too with the auto industry right if they advanced technologically like the electronic one the best car would transport us with
exactly yes well like they say too with the motor industry right if the motor industry would have advanced technologically much like the electronic industry then maybe an automobile will let us transport like
one hundred kilometers with only one liter of gas
at one hundred kilometers with just one liter of gas
100 km with only 1 liter of gasoline
one hundred kilometers with one liter of gas
no and instead of costing let's say twenty thousand dollars it would cost you two thousand dollars
no and instead of costing twenty thousand dollars they would be costing two thousand dollars
right and instead of costing you say 20000 dollars would cost you 2000
right and instead of costing like twenty thousand dollars it would only cost ten thousand dollars
if that was the case no but like technology in this case industry it has its own interests it like moves on you know what they're talking now about hybrids
if that's the case no but technology that industry at best has its own interests and it's as if it doesn't advance no you heard what they are saying about the hybrids
if that were the case no but as technology in this case the industry has its interests then no like it doesn't move forward no you see what they're saying now with the hybrids
if that was the case no but like the technology in this case the industry has their interests well no like it does not advance no you can see already what they are saying now about the hybrids
that at lot of them say that they are not affordable that it's really a matter of image that companies do and when it comes to see the the return tables
i say no many are saying that they are not cost effective and that in reality is a matter of manipulating company image when the times comes for viewing performance tables
that no a lot of them say that they're not affordable that in reality it's only a matter of image that companies manage and when it's time to see the tables of of performance
that no most of them say that they are not feasible and that in reality it is only a matter of image that the companies manage and when the time comes to see the the scoreboard
of the hybrid cars well i though they would be a lot more efficient but i think what they've achieved is a minimal efficiency
i though hybrids cars would be more efficient i think the efficiency they have achieved is minimum
of the hybrid cars well i thought they would be much more efficient i think that what they have accomplished on efficiency is minimal
regarding hybrid automobiles well i thought that they were going to be much more efficient i think that the efficiency they have achieved is minimal
no no i don't think they have a real hmm that they are a really big technological breakthrough given the efficiency that
no no i don't think they have a real real that they it is really an important change in technology given its efficency
no no it doesn't seem to me that they have a real a real this that it's really a very important change like technological given the efficiency that
no no i don't think that they have a real a real ehm that it is really a change like that very importanttechnological given the efficiency that
excuse me
pardon me
what
pardon
and how consider the technology question no in your daily life if it become more in a problem than in a solution or something like that
and you consider the tecnology no your daily life if it turns out to be more a problem than a solution or something like that
and how do you consider the issues of the technology no you daily life if it turn more of a problem than a solution something like that
and how do you consider the matter of technology no your daily life if it becomes more of a problem than a solution or something like that
no i don't think it's so important taking into account that the efficiency they show is not radically different from the other cars' i mea
no no i don't think it is so important at the same time the efficiency they show es radically different than that of other cars it is too little no you see that's what i say
no i don't think that it is so important every time that the efficiency they demonstrate isn't radically different to the one the other cars have is very little no you see i say
no i don't think that it is that important at the same time that the efficiency they have proven is not radically different to the ones others have it is very little no you see i say
according to the tables an economical car will give you maybe thirtysix miles per gallon
one ah according to the tables an economical car can provide you with thirty six miles per galon
one to according to the tables an economical car drives you it can be thirtysix miles per gallon
a a according to the rules an economy car drives you it could be thirtysix miles per gallon
and a hybrid can give you fifty
and a hybrid can give you fifty
and a hybrid can drive you fifty
and a hybrid can drive you fifty
uhm well
uhm well
uh well
oh so
aha
aha
uh huh
ok
yes exactly and and sure and but at the same time for example with those autos of ehm there have been small cars that give you almost the same mileage than the hybrid and they are not hybrid isn't it
yes that's right sure but at the same time for example these cars the small cars they have the same performance as the hybrid cars and they are not hybrids no
yes exactly and and of course and but at the same time for example with these autos of um there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance as the hybrids and they're not hybrids no
yes exactly but at the same time cars like this there are some small cars that give you almost the same performance that hybrids and they aren't hybrids no
by small cars new that are not in the northamerican market that are in the european or latinamerican market where they have to be much more efficient
the small cars the new ones that are not yet in the american market that are now in the european or latin america's markets have to be more efficient
by small cars new ones that aren't in the north american market that are in the european or latin american market where they have to be much more efficient
by small cars news that are not in the north american market they are in the european market or latino american where they have to be more efficient
and smaller no so if we compare the costs of a hybrid against a smaller european car or or of teh ones that circulate in latinamerica so then
and smaller isn't it so if we buy a car at the price of a hybrid car and we compare it against a small european car or to one of those cars of latin american well
and smaller no so if we compare the costs of a hybrid against a small european car or or from iso which circulate in latinamerica well then
and smaller no then if we compare with the spend of a hybrid against a small europe car or those that run in latinoamerica so
no it is much more expensive to have a car which is because of the initial cost and why it will be saved a lot in in gas it ends up
it's a lot more expensive to have a car because the initial cost and because you will save money on gas then
n it turns out to be much more expensive to have a car at what is the initial cost and for what is going to be saved in gasoline ends
it goes out more expensive have a car for the initial spend and for what you can save in gasoline finally
being less than to what a car has a good economy car no
it's cheaper that a normal car a good economical car right
being less to what an auto has a good economic car no
its less that you have a car very low cost no
its the same issue that i was thinking sure they must added no
is the same that is the same that i was thinking of course it should be included no
it's the same as as i was thinking exactly that they should include it no
it is the same that it is the same i was thinking clearly they should include it no
european
european
european
european
yes it is yes
yes it's like yes
yes it's yes
yes i am yes
yes i precisely years ago when there was the problem with petroleum in the eighties or something like that i recall
yes i do a few years ago it had something to do with the oil in the eighties or around that time i don't remember
yes i as a matter of fact years ago that was the problem with oil in the eighties or something like that i don't remember
yes i just a few years ago the oil problem in the eighties or something like that i don't remember
i thought that it there was going to be a change in the culture because they started to to develop smaller cares here in the united states
i thought that was going to change that the culture was going to change because they started making smaller cars here in the united states
i thought that there was going to be a change in the culture because they started to to develop smaller cars here in the united states
i thought i was having an exchange of culture because they started to develope little more here in the united states
i thought well there is going to be a change in the culture but that was a thing of only the moment no it seems because it has some huge cars they continue like
so i thought oh well the culture is going to change but it didn't it was like a temporal thing because they still have lots of huge cars they still
i though well there will be a change in the culture but that was only for the moment no it seems because it has some enormous cars they continue like
i thought well i was going to have an exchange of culture but that was nothing by the time no it seems because they have a big cars they keep like
exactly so yes if the cars seems to be so important no then i thought better is a computer bu no
exactly yes but i said well yes the automobile seems to be the most important no is then i thought maybe is the computer but no
exactly how's then but i told then that yes the car look as the most important no and i think after that at best a computer too but no
exactly well but i said well yes the automobile seems to be the most important no it is then i thought maybe it is the computer but no
ok exactly but sometimes seems like a personal element depending of the case so it can be a car no because the computer is a tool every time more
aha exactly but sometimes eh what seems like a more personal element depending on the case then it can be the car no because the computer is now every time more just another tool
aha exactly but sometimes eh it looks more like a personal element depending on the case could be the cars no because the computer already is a tool more
aha exactly but sometimes eh what seems like a more personal element depending on the case well it can be the car no because the computer is more and more another tool
hi good eh matt here
hello hi uh mateo
hey very good eh mateo here
hello well eh mateo here
why do you need to look after the car yes do you know
because you have to take care of the car and you know
why you have to take care of the car you know
because you have to be careful with the car and you know

ah
ah
okay
did you used the horses more

yes because here in texas yes because up here in texas
yes because in texas yes but even there in texas
yes because in texas there yes but only there
yes because here in texas yes but even there in texas
you need the car do you know for work
you all need a car you know to work
you need the car you know to work
you need the car you know to to work
then
so that
so
so
ah yes yes
ah yes yes
ah yes yes
really yes yes
i see
yeah
uh
right
yes and you are
yes yes yes and you are
yes yes and you are
yes yes yes and you are
yes but the questions on the subject were which
yes but the questions in the topic were which
yes but the questions about the topic where which ones
yes but the cuestions on the topic were what
well for me it would be more my computer and my cellular telephone
well for me it would be my computer and cellphone
well for me it would be more my computer and my cell phone
well for mi it would be more my computer and my cell phone
because you know because i have my cellular and i'm always with it
because you know because i have my cellphone and i am always with it
because you know because i have my cell phone and i am always with it
because you know because i have my cell phone and i'm always with it
and okay i have become accustomed to having a cellular telephone you know
and well i have become used to having a cellphone you know
and well i have gotten used to having a cell phone you know
and well i've grown accustomed to having a cellphone you know
before i didn't have a cellphone until i was like twenty years old but now that to that i live in philadelphia in the city and that i'm not always at home for
before i did not have a cellphone until i became twenty years old but now that i live in philadelphia in the city and that i'm not always at home for
in before i did not have a cell phone until i was about twenty years old but now that to that live in philadelphia in the city and that i am not always at the house fo
back then i didn't had a cell phone until i was like twenty but now that a that i live in philadelphia in the city and that i'm not always going back home fo
i'm not always going back home for for you know to look at my messages
i'm always returning to my house for for you know see my messages
i'm not always returning to the house for you know see my messages
not always going back home for for you know seeing my messages
okay always always i am always i have my cellphone
well i am always i am always i always have my cellphone
well i am always always i always have my cell phone
well i'm always always always having my cellphone
i think that it's very it's like surprising that almost everybody has a cellphone here in the united states
i think that it is very surprising that almost the whole world has a cellphone here in the united states
i think that it is very is like surprising that almost everybody has a cell phone here in the united states
i think it's very it's like surprising that almost everyone has a cellphone here in the united states
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes how have you being
yes how have you been
yes what you where what
yes how how have you been
but now
but now
but now
but now
well for me i think very well yourself and yourself was working for texas and obviously you know there is more hm how you say i undertand that there is more like lands and someplace there understand
well for me i think that well you're in texas and obviously there are more free land and contryside and
good for i think how good you and you were in texas and obviously you know there there's more uh how do you say it i understand you have more like farms and everything there you know
well for me i believe that well you and you where around texas and obiously you know that there is more how you say i understand that there is more buildings and stuff around there you know
way more space
a lot more space
much more space
lot more space
for in the city having a auto it can be convenient as well
because in the cities having a car can be an inconvenient thing also

yes because in the end he likes the product that's why
yes the one who likes the product for that reason
with you it is the maximum responsibility if it is violence sex whatever it is protect a child the biggest responsibility is of the parents even with classification
with you that you are have the greatest responsibility be violence sex whatever you want to protect a child for i think the parents have the greatest responsibility although you have a rating
with you it's final responsibility whether it's violence sex whatever there is to protect a a child the final responsibility it's for the parents even with a qualification system in place
with you that is the most responsibility whether is in violence of sex of what ever you want to protect a a child in the responsibility is of the parents even if there is a classification
because there is a classification of a movie for example pg thirteen
because if you have a movie rating for example pg thirteen
because if there's for example a movie qualified as pg 13
because if there is a movie classification for example pg thirteen
and you have a small child of that age and you let him watch that movie it is your responsibility
and you have e minor child of that age to see it it's your responsibility
and you have a minor of that age and you let him see the movie it's your responsibility
if you have younger child and if you let him/her watch the movie is your responsibility
it is because you let him and you thought what can be done isn't it true
is because you let him and thought that is okay isn't that right
it's because you let him and you thought it could be isn't it
is because you let him/her and you thought it could be is that right
hello faviola
hello faviola
hi faviola

the why the association or whatever he puts eh you have the rating and he already has it then
entonces why me the the the association or or or whatever that puts the uh that puts the qualifications already has it then
so then because i the the association or or or whoever places places the classification already have it then
i believe yes we believe more or less the same thing in that faviola because in the end the responsibility of raising taking are of and wanting them to see or not see
i think yes look that we think almost the same on that faviola because in the end the responsibility of raising and caring and what you want him to see or not
i think yeah look we think more or less the same on that faviola because in the end the responsibility of nurtering and taking care and what you want him to see and what not
i think if imagine we think more or less the same in that faviola because at the end you realize that the responsibility or raising and take care and of what you want them to see and not see

yes because because
yeah why why
it's bad here it's really cold here what do you think about movies have you already talked about that subject
because we are ugly we are cold how are the movies had we already spoken about this issue
over here it's ugly we are too cold what do you think of the movies have you already talked about this topic
over here weather is ugly it is cold what do you think about the movies have you talked already about this topic
but imagine the same we can't control them
but imagine that you still can't control them
but think that you can not control them
but imagine if you cant control it
that's why i'm tell you you can control them you can't see this movie because of this and this reason because you need to be more mature or whatever you want to tell them it's not true
that's why i'm telling you you can control them  you can't watch this movie because this and this reason because you're not mature enough or whatever you want to tell them right
that´s what i say you can control them you can not see this movie because of this or that because you lack of maturity or whatever we want to tell them isn´t that true
that's what i mean you can control it you need to be more mature it isn't true
yes and that's why i'm telling you that you don't get nothing out in telling them you can't see that no because there will come a time in which they go to the house like i say to a friends house
yeah that's why i'm telling you you get nothing from telling her  you can't watch that so because there will be a time when she'll go to a house how can i say her friend's house
yes that is why i say it doesn´t have a purpose to say you can not see that not because there will be a time when they go to a friend´s house
yeah that's why i said you don't get anything good out of watching it like at his friends house
or the same school but the same school is under a little more supervision because that's another thing because becacuase ther is a goal
oh the same school but the same school is a bit more supervised because that is already a different thing because because it goes it goes with an end
oh the same school but the same school is a little more supervised because that is another thing because it goes it goes with a purpose
oh the same school but the same school is a little more supervised because that's already another thing because they have a purpose
but what i fear the most is when it goes to friend's houses and the have the television right there that's used a lot or the computer or whatever
but i'm more afraid when he goes to friends' houses and sometimes they have the television in the piece the most that it is used or the computer or whatever it is
but what i fear more is when he goes to friends' house and they have sometimes the television right there in the room that they use it so much or the computer or whatever
but what i fear the most is when they go to their friend's house and they sometimes have the television right there in the room which is so customary nowadays or the computer or whatever
and they have access to the information without the parents no without tha parents having any idea at all and they are in the  piece and the parents think they are listening to music or whatever
and they have access to information without the parents no the parents have no idea and they are in the piece believe the parents believe that they are listening to music or whatever it is

and they have access to information without their parents without their parents having any idea and they are in the room their parents think that they are listening to music or whatever
maybe they are watching something nonadequate that's why i say i mean if my son or daughter or whoever
maybe they are looking at something inadequate but that's what i say whatever happens it's that my son and my daughter or whatever it is
at best they are looking at something inappropriate then that's why i say or that is that which happens it's that if my daughter or my son or whatever
perhaps they are watching something inappropriate that's why i mean what happens is that if my daughter or son or whatever it is
is presented to that situation it needs to learn to value itself and learn to answer to that that's what i say therefore trying trying to give the values of the house
are faced with that situation he has to learn to value himself and learn to respond to that that's what they said or rather trying trying to give them the values of the house
faces that situation he has to learn to value and to learn to respond to that that is what i say or rather trying trying to give them the values of the house
faces that situation he has to learn to value himself and learn to respond to that that's what i say in other words trying to instill in him the home values

sometimes cartoons yes
sometimes cartoons yes
cartoons are like that sometimes
sometimes the cartoons yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes yes it's true but really it's not the cartoons i'm sorry the japanese cartoons are are the ones that huh have more classification in mÃ©xico uh

yes yes it's true but really it's not cartoons sorry japanese cartoons are the ones that have the most classification eh in mexico eh
yes yes it's true but there are not really the cartoons sorry the japanese cartoons are are those which have more classification eh have in mexico eh
uh tru in cablevisiÃ³n and multivisiÃ³n that would be what cable here to uh there in mÃ©xico it hasn't all those restrictions but for example in normal tv's with normal channels
eh on cablevision and multivision which would be what cable here there in mexico doesn't have too many restrictions but for example on regular television normal channels
eh tr in cablevision and multivision that would be the same as cable here so ah over there in mexico they don't have as many restrictions for example in regular television with regular channels
eh surin cablevision and multivision what would be what cable here so oh there in mexico they don't have so many restrictions but for example in ordinary televisions the regular channels
yes it has like more more restrictions uh not so much now on the other cables and for example in in tv's for example normal of ch children's channel
they have like more more restrictions eh not so much on other cables and for example in on tv for example normal channels for children
they have like more more restrictions eh not so much in the other cables and for example in in teles for example a regular ch channel for kids
yes they have more more restrictions eh not too much in the other channels and for example in in tvs for example regular of cha children channels
of television like any channel the channel for example what is the five in cartoons
television like that any channel the channel for example which is five in caricatures

for example well then at ten of clock eleven and you can watch tv and they don't put on programs so ugly like that well
for example then it goes until ten at night eleven and you an watch tv and they don't show such ugly programs well
for example after ten at night eleven and you can watch tv and they don't show such ugly programs well
for example then arrives at ten o'clock at night eleven and you can watch the tv and they don't transmit so unpleasant programs well
before in mÃ©xico but for example if you're watching a cable channel now you risk the cartoon possibly being something sometimes some kind of
before in mexico but for example if you are watching a cable channel you already risk that the cartoon can be about something that sometimes that some
before in mexico but for example if you are watching a cable channel you run the risk that the cartoon may be something that sometimes is some
before in mexico but for example if you are watching a cable channel you take the risk that the cartoon could be about something sometimes about some

they don't leave anything to the mi to the imagination they show it right away
they don't leave nothing to the my to the imagination they show it to you
they do not leave a thing to imagination they show you
they already don't leave anything to the mi to the imagination they now show it to you
oh and the other one
ah ok and the other
ah i see and the other one
ah already and the other
now at any time of the day and you go and watch soap operas i don't like watching soap operas but you see
already at any at any time of the day you watch one of those soap operas i don't like watching soap operas but you see
now at whatever whatever time of the day you see one of those telenovelas i do not like to watch telenovelas but see
now at any at any time of the day you see with one of those soap operas i don't like to watch soap operas but you see
many mo moms are at home and they have little children three four years old five or more or they're at home and they watch they're watching their soap opera
how much mom is at home and has little children three four years five or more or are at home and see they are watching their soap opera
many momon is home and has young children three four years five or more they are at home and they see they are watching their telenovela
how much __ mom is at home and has her small children of three four years old five or more or they are at home and they see they are watching her soap opera
and they're al always show scenes where they are the the couple they're there having relations
and always there are scenes were they are the a couple there they are having relations
and always estthey show scenes were they are the a couple they are there having relations
and always ar they show scenes where they are the the a couple they are there having sex
and in the middle of the day because the soap operas later are on from six in the morning until nightfall
and in broad daylight because the soap operas then passed from one to six in the morning until it was dark
during the day why do they put on sooperas from six am until it gets dark
and during the day because sopa operas are on air from six in the morning until night
and that's how they are so now they don't leave anything to the imagination
and that's the way it is it leaves nothing to the imagination
and they're like that so then we stop having an imagination
and they are like that leaving nothing to imagination
so the programs are classified to see a scene of pornography on the television at anytime of the day is normal and for many
then the programs are already sorted and a scene of pornography on television at any time of day is normal and for many
then the programs are classified so it would be normal to see a pornographic on tv in the middle of day
then programs are now rated ans whatching a pornogrpahic scene in tv an any time is normal and for many
parents unfortunately are making it normal
parents this unfortunately is normal
and the parents would think its something normal
parents it's becoming unfortunately normal
and i believe that that if the parents spoke to this television station and said that or demand that that were more strict programs to to privacies of scenes of this type of scenes
and i think that if parents would talk to the television stations and say that they should require more stringent programs like the privacy of scenes such scenes
and i think that if the parents talked to that tv station and told them to put away unacceptable programs or to put privacy on some scenes from those kind of scenes
and i think that if parents talk to the broadcaster and demand for a more restricted television of this kind of scenes
i believe that they would decrease a little but anyways not now or until parents if their children see something like that it's okay it's no problem
i think it would go down a bit but that no longer happens and even if parents and their children see something they're like  oh okay no problem
i think it will go down a little but i don't know anymore its now normal when parents and kids watch something like that together
i think it would be a little better but now parents are fine if the children watch something like that there is not problem
teaching and so these things of classifications i don't like and i believe it doesn't matter to the producers bei feel that to them its beneficial because
that will be taught and then so will these classifications i do not like and i don't think these producers care i feel that to them it is because
what are they teaching them i don't like those classification things and the producers dont really care i think its only convenient to them because
they should teach themselves and then that's why i don't like the classification system producers don't really care about that i think they find helpful classification because
i'm talking from idaho i don't know if you know it
yes i'm here in idaho state i don't know if you've heard of it

if a movie has some sex scene or has crudeness for the people they buy it or the people see it and they even sthey laugh
if a movie has a sex scene or is too rude for people to buy or for people to see it it gives them laughs
if a movie has a sexual scene or bad words people buy it or people watch it and even laugh about it
if a movie has a sex scene or rude language for the buyers well they will laugh
or sometimes it even calls their attention because it has a very strong scene so really these these things sometimes even help more
or is sometimes called to attention because it has a very strong scene sometimes these things do more to help them
or sometimes it even gets their attention because there's a strong scene so those things actually help the
and sometimes it brings attention because it's a really strong scene then those things sometimes help to
producers to sell

then no personally i like movies like i like disney movies or
children's movies i like them
children's films i like them
i like kids movies
child movies i like them
even though i i am tired and i love all of this i have some disney movie around here sincerely i do not like the movies
though now i'm married and i love all that i have some here from another disney movie honestly i do not like movies
even though i'm already tired of them but still like them i have a disney movie here but i honestly just don't like movies

strong so that that have many things of of sex and all that because equally i repeat to you that i am going to have more kids and while i am not going to be and
strong so that have a lot things of sex because i am going to repeat myself i have more children and in awhile i am not going to be
hardcore movies that that have a lot of sex and all that because i repeat it to you i am going to have children so i would not be
that are really intense that have a lot of things like like sex and all that because again i tell you i'm going to have more kids and at times i'm not going to be here
and at least that if they are going to put on a movie well that it is at least a decent movie that it does not have so many things
at least if they going to put a movie then the movie will have to be decent at least that don't have a lot stuff
and at least if they are going to play a movie well that at least it is a decent movie that does not have so many things
and at least if they are going to put on a movie well let it be a decent movie at least that it doesn't have so many things
that is so that while we have those from disney at least they are going to be have pornography right then/well
that if we keep going like that maybe until disney is going to be porno right so
as the things are going even the disney ones may have pornography in a while right then
the way things are going soon even the ones from disney perhaps will have pornography right so
no no yes then already this is the truth this is bringing the truth far as it already goes you turn on the television and if you you already see a commercial
no so if this is getting true this is getting very far if you turn on the tv you watch a commercial
no no so then already the truth is that this is truly reaching too far already you turn the tv on and see a tv spot
no no the truth is this is going honestly too far you turn on the television and if you you already see a commercial
yes well personally i don't believe that much about the movies ratings for my point of view the ratings don't go the way i suppose they would be
yes this one the truth is a lot of that is movies the truth is a lot of things em from my point of view really there isn't much in common with me because after
yes but that thing about the movies the fact is than in my point of view i don´t agree with them because after all
if this truth because i see lot of that in the movies a lot of truth in my view i don't really quite agree with them
of feminine towels and it seems fine/well until almost almost they are goint to explain to you how while they are going to put a naked woman and they are going toyou
of female pads it seems good so almost they are going to explain how to they put a naked woman and they are going to
about women pads and it appears well until almost they are going to explain how soon they will display a naked movie and are going to
of feminine pads and they appear there and they are going to explain there how and in a while they will put a naked woman and they will
put there how she is placing the towel
put there how to place the pad
show there how she is placing the pad on
show there how they are putting on the pad
because sometimes until they show it to you i don't know if you have seen the commercials that ugh likewise/equally it frightens you because you are big right but
because sometimes even they draw her i don't know i have seen the commercials so you dont afraid because your big no but
because sometimes they even draw it for you i do not know if you have seen such commercials that uf they do not scare you because you are already grown up right but
because sometimes they even draw it i don't know if you've seen commercials like that all the same it doesn't scare you because you're already big right but
but if a boy or a girl is seeing it for example and yoiu say if it is the mom and you can answer well fine and if it is the friend boy or girl
but if a boy or a girl is watching by example and you say if the mom is there its fine and if his friends
if a little boy or girl is watching them and you say it the mom is there and can answer all is right and if it is the friend who is there
but if for example a boy or a girl is watching it and you say if the mom is there she can explain it to them in a good way and if a friend is there
and you tell them and can explain to him/her the bad information then
answer you can explain the bad information so
and she or he answers he/she can explain him/her the wrong info so
and they tell them they can explain it with bad information so
then already yes
so now yes
then yes
then yes
they don't know how to rate them for example sometimes they said that it is a pg movie but when you watch it and it really
you don't know how to classify it very very well eh for example after sometimes they say it's pg and after eh you see that movie and really
they don´t classify them very well ah for example sometimes they say is pg and later you see that movie and it really
they are not ranked very well you know eh for example they sometimes say it's pg and then you see it eh that movie and really

mm
hmm
mm
mm
yes that is a complicated and very controversial theme
yes which is a very complicated and polemical
yes a very complicated subject and very controversial
yes it's a very complicated and polemic subject
what happens is that yes because in this country the kids when the families the christian families that righties say that they raise their children in a manner that when they are very little they teach them to be like that and that's how it is so
what happens is that if it is that in this country the children when they are those families christian families from the right wing let´s say they raise their children in a way that they teach them since they are very little that things must be that way and then then
what happens is that yes it is that in this country when children are those families the christian families that rightwing let's say that they raise their children in such a way that since they are very young they teach them they have to be like that and like that and like that then
what happens is this it's that in this country that when children are in those types of families the christian families that are rightwing let's say that those children are raised in a way that that starting from birth they are taught that they need to be like this and this and this therefore
when they are older and know that people are different well they say no that is not right because they taught me like that and that is how they have to be
when they are adults and meet different people then they say that is not that way because i was taught that is like this and this and this and it must be like this
when they are older and they meet people who are different then they tell them no that is not that because they taught me it is like this and like this and like this and it has to be
when they are older and meet people that are different then they say  it's not like that because they taught me that this and this and this and you have to be
you know they are very radicals no they don't accept differences because they were raised in a manner that their parents taught them so
you know they are very radicals not they don´t accept the differences because they were raised in a way their parents did then
you know that they are very radical no they don't accept differences because they were rased in a way that their parents taught them hten
you know they are very radical no they do not accept differences because they were raised by their parents so
and for example i had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of different races cultures so i am very open to everything
for example me i had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of all the races several cultures then i am open minded to everything
i for example had the good fortune of traveling a lot of meeting people from many races many cultures then i am open to everything
for example i was lucky to travel a lot and meet people from many races from many cultures therefore i am well open to everything
and so when i see a person who is not and so i immediately know only by looking at them i say this person will not accept me because i'm not like them i am not i don't think the same i don't look the same
and because of that when i see a person that is not i immediately know it only by seeing the person i say this person is not going to accept me because i am not like her i am not i don´t think alike i don´t look alike
and that is why when i see a person who is not i immediately know it just looking at them i say this person is not going to accept because i am not like her i am not i don't think the same i don't see myself the same
and that is why when i see a person who is not i immediately recognize it just with one glance i say this person is not going to accept me because i am not like her i am not i do not think the same i do not look the same
but is that there are classes there are mu people of different classes and well there has to be radicals christians there has to be everything but i think that yes religion does influence the country yes
but it is that there are people of all kinds and and well there must be radicals christians there must be everything but i think that if the country has a lot of influence the religion yes
but it is that there are kinds there are people of all kinds and and well there must be radical christians there must be all kinds but i believe that yes it does influence the country a lot the religion yes
but it is that there are classes there are people from many classes and and you have radical christians there has to be of all kinds but i believe it is true and that it strongly influences the country religion yes

he understood things and personsthis government can we say its run by the that he the religious the christians from right or is what they are
saying how to do things in the country and that's why there is such a polemic with marriages also there is with the with the supreme court with with the judges that they want them to be from the right also and that they are religious well they
saying how things are made in the country and that is why there is so much controversy with marriage it's also with the supreme court with the jury who want them to be righties and religious well

don't care whether they are catholics they just want that they they want to eliminate the right to abortion and things like that it's ridiculous at this stage in the century
be or catholics or whatever they also want that they take abortion rights and things then so it is it is ridiculus at this point in century
that like that they want that things go backwards that they go back instead of going forward they want that things become as they were thirty or forty years ago and that can not be
like they they want things to go backwards go backwards instead of going forward they want things to be like thirty or forty years and that can't be
they want they want us to go back to go back instead of moving forward they want things that were done thirty or forty years ago that can't happen
what how they want things to go back to back up instead of moving forward they want things to be the way they were thirty or forty years ago and that can not be
