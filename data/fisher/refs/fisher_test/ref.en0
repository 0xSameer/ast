hello
yes yes okay i almost finish here
then there are many things like that too then everything everything depends on the course but
eh yes yes here there is and i hardly write anything in general then it looked pretty weird that i had to write
but em and what else and now ant time here surely you donÂ´t like it right
too much cold here right
yes
not yes
hm
pe
but in peru i've heard there are parts where it really gets cold
hm mm
but but
hm yea i see
so i'm in wharton
then if it's business but then you are a student for a phd the master's is that exactly
ah i'm an undergraduate ah okay okay
ah but these hours here
but then did you live in peru
did you live in peru
ah
then you're a freshman
hello good evening who is this
ah ah okay so you're not an exchange student you're a transfer
ah ah that's good
ah that's good and what do you think so far
yes is it of english or is it
all all the work
yes yes
yes
more than in peru
mm
hm mm
oh guillermo
mm
ah okay okay
yes yes
yes but it's still pretty intensive
yes it's hard
uhm it depends in general five but ah sometimes i think it's just four last cycle i only took four but now i'm taking five
but in general people in college only take four
i think but in wharton people generally take five
eh
i do have i have a little job at the library it's work study but uh it's not really a job because when i'm there
oh this is josé
i study so it's not like that
hmm
ah i did that sometimes but no but in what are you doing what part of the library in
mm okay okay
in lippincott
it's it's the library at wharton
yes it's on the second floor mm no but yes it's there it's a good job because i work alone and i don't work too many hours just five hours a week sometimes i work ten hours a week but
that's how it is i do my homework really so it's not so well there are there are times there are yea but for the end there's only a little bit more than a month of work left because
there's more people who need help and everyone
is doing their research and but in general it's pretty no i don't have a lot of work
oh buti live here in philadelphia
but yes here it's eh but what i've seen is that for example sometimes i from uh in latin america but you saw that in europe
in the universities they give you uh well in general there's not a lot of work just until the end really so the professors
uh yea in europe in general really
hm mm
hm mm
yes yes yes
yes well well well them well no no they don't give them much work but in general they want that we well it is supposed true that one is
yes that one reads all that they are doing exercises and that they continue doing all that true
i understand all the truth and then in the end they give an exam and that is the grade but here in the united states it's
different true because here especially in history one has to investigate and then an essay and then another and another exam and
yes yes and you
that is the best in the sense that one okay that there are less risks but ay
the traba yes yes but
yes
yes
yeah
yeah yeah no but there's also all the work they give you i mean yeah every week you have one thing and another
other job another job so
every system has it's advantages but and in peru Âhow's it like in general
uh um
uh um
oh what do you study
uh um
uh um
uh um
uh um right
yes
hmm mm
yes yes
yes yes
hm mm hmm mm
yes hmm mm hm mm
oh i am also a student here i'm eh senior
yes yes
yes
yes yes
yes well it is it is it is different because in wharton well it also depends well it depends because for example i say classes i take in general don't have
like essays or research only in general two three exams and and that's it but there are classes for example that have more like that well you have the two exams but you also have projects
these like case studies
in groups in general those days almost everything is in groups and of course if they give you homework things little things like that for one to be reviewing because otherwise
because and and and i like it like that for example every week you have homework a small one you have to turn in because that way
one has they make you study every week truly
but yes that that that i like sometimes they do that but in general they are exams or projects but in
from university of pennsylvania too
each class always has an exam i don't i have never had a class where there were only projects true but in general two exams and maybe one project
in the then now in the marketing class we have a a project that is like a e and i don't know how they did it eh eh and
they created a whole piece of software that is like a simulation and then one for example each request well there are like five orders or six orders then
you have a group
and then everyone each group is assigned a company
then one have several products this company has several products then you have to decide based on each product well where are we going what kind of
how are we going to sell this product we are going to
place more if if is is like one one is in a of course is not like in the real life but
it helps if if is not is not interesting but then then when that ends you have to write some like that essays to make an analysis
of what you made of the the mistakes of what you did well
hello
oh that's good
i'd say even the i mean i remember once i must have gone to the mountains in peru and it's something on vacation with my family and yea at night
it could get even get colder than the cold i've experienced here
and you are studying is that you
hm
is that no undergraduate
hm mm hm mm hm mm
sorry
i i'm sorry as you say
that is i was living in peru until three months ago
clearly
no what happened what i studied at the university of peru for two years and then i transferred that is i'm an international transfer
how's it going hey this is guillermo how are you
it is clear eh eh i will graduate with a degree from this university
as op as opposed to an exchange student for example doesn't
eh it's a bit hard to tell you the truth
and n well english english in fact is a let's say
it's a difficulty i mean eh eh y have have studied english a larger part of my life but anyways it's more difficult to express myself in english than express myself in spanish
no i mean that is eh very clear for me
eh but apart from that yes because of the amount of work that they that they send me also it's a
i yes i think so they send you more
more more than in peru even in the last cycle i in in in peru eh in my university i took six classes eh one semester
and and even like that i think that i had less work than what i'm having now taking five classes
yes
but well what happens is that i'm taking five classes but i also work
i don't know maybe that's equivalent to taking six classes or something like that
maybe it's it's a little less i don't think it's so demanding as taking six classes
i think so yes maybe in the future i decide to
i i'll decide to take less classes i don't know how many courses do you take per cycle more or less
yeah and and you
i see
i see and do you work or
or are you a full time student
ah it's very advantageous what what do you do in i also work in the library but i'm a shelver
how's it going where are you from
so really it doesn't give me the chance to study
in the fifth floor of van pelt
where do you work
where's that
yea
hm mm
hm mm
ah in in in england for example
yes i've heard that too that i mean the amount of for example of the the the number of hours that you have in class each week
they are less than three
in philadelphia
then you have a lot of free time doesn't have much class
and aside i think that yes well they don't give you much work no no i'm not sure no no
of course hm mm hm mm
hm mm
yes ofcourse that that that definitely that is an advantage no truth that there are less risks
because really imagine that for example you go to a a a a a decide your exam grade all of a sudden the night before you couldn't sleep o
whichever may have happened and all of a sudden
in the exam you don't all of a sudden you may have prepared a lot but for x reason it didn't go well in the exam then
i mean let's say your grade
i mean your your grade goes down i don't know
i i am peruvian eh i am studying in the university of pennsylvania
yeah yeah yeah
let's see i mean i would say they also make us work i mean we don't we have like an equivalent to midterms
but they're mostly reading controls
uh through all i mean spread let's say through the semester
and for some courses not all of them you're also asked to at the end of the course to deliver an essay a research paper
and also you also have a final exam but let's say you don't have to produce as much as you do here
i mean you don't have to write much
here they're like constantly making you writing papers and reviews Âright
there not so much i mean there instead what you had to write for example you wrote it in the exam or to give in that is in the investigation
in the final semester but aside all of that no you didn't have to produce much
eh i study history
and well i mean that could be seen as advantageous in the sense that you don't have they don't ask you much i mean
one can live more relaxed
but the point is the disadvantage is that you don't come you don't get to practice your your no you are not in a constant practice of labor of
investigation and neither about how to describe right i mean sometimes one for not writing much one loses ease right write so
i would tell you that i mean it's more it's easier right i mean
it's easier but i don't know if it is say if they form it so well like they form it here
but it has a cost that your form that is the cost is that here they make form you better it's good but at least me for example this final weekend i am full of things to do so
you live a little more uh at least i live a little more anxious say a little more
stressed
but i don't know how wharton might be i don't know
what university
ok
and are the personal or group products
of course
hm mm
hm mm hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
ah that is interesting
but well it resembles at least in some
hm hm
oh yes
hm hm
yeah
how come
well yes yes yes yes i think it was on tuesday at night that was raining
i got frozen yes well i have to go with my coat i mean with my i have is i bought a coat that shelters a lot
and i have for well i always go out with it but still sometimes even using the coat i get cold too but well inside my room it is more
m manageable the matter of of the d inside the dorm yea yea the temperature is is it's i it's good enough
warm right
well right yea yes if you go to the mountains
also at nighttime more than anything well if you go to the mountains in the wintertime in in winter uh the winter nights in the mountains are really cold yea
hello my name is glori
ah okay um i am catholic so i believe i believe um it joins some and separate others for example i have a nephew that is gay
really ah yes i think she's from georgia
yes from atlanta yes yes yes yes
ah in ah
ah okay okay yes a niece of mine lived in georgia but moved she still lives in georgia but she had to sell her house because she got divorced from her husband
so she had to sell the house and now she's alone yes
yes my niece yes she has about fortysomething years old
yes
so they are catholics they don't accept gay people
because they say that god didn't make them that way so i remember when my nephew was born we know wee knew that he was going to be one
people never believe that they are born that way but he was and if you have someone in your family you know so he
has a lot of problems with the catholic religion because they don't accept him and he knows he's not accepted so he finally found a church in the thirtytwo in new york that accepts homosexuals
mhm aha
mhm
aha
mhm
exactly
from new york
mhm
mhm
mmh
aha aha
yes yes yes lie this what was i going to say i at lunch time i to the girls where i work where i work three
i take this a little book by joyce myers and he an everyday scriptures and i read them then they tell me ah that is shit that i say but
listen what she is saying listen that you treat your neighbor well like you you would like to treat you ah no i don't have to treat her well
i don't like her i say but everybody is created in the image of god ay we start to fight then i say look i want peace because what happens is that everything and i not to
we talk about about about today's subject but forget it one has been made but still they look for me to to read everyday
because there is one that is like a firecracker and i was telling her that i don't want to hang out with her because she drains
from long island
all my energy and she is always criticizing everyone and i don't want i don't want to be in this environment she says yes i read to her everyday the other days she is saying
write down five things you are thankful to god for eh am who do you think you are forget it she always ay you are always reading something about religion that
i say that is the only thing that has saved my mind because otherwise if i start to criticize that everybody criticizes me and i know that i am a good person and that god just like i am
if i let people influence me i would have already jumped out of a window
and that is what happens to her she is criticized then she i say look god loves you and like you are but you have to you can not be criticizing everyone
yes
uh huh
yes uh huh
uh huh
yes yes yes yes yes yes
from long island
uh huh uh huh
it's that it's that the eh eh precisely the catholic religion the whole world is going like m my friend she went to another church she tells me
this this and this and the other and i say you have to find the church where you want that you believe that you fits you
or that in i'm not going to tell you that you should go to the catholic church if it's not giving you anything because i go to catholic church
so then she she found another church she tells me maybe you should go with me i say no leave me to me to where i am going i am more agreeable where i am
and you know i am going to charismatic groups so then n n i like to go to other churches i'm not going to say that i don't go but i don't want that she co me
now i have been to that church now i have been back many times and and it takes all day sunday and i don't have the whole day on sunday to be there
three hours four hours
uh huh
i believe it's something like christian science
aha
yes yes yes they are like born again christians or something like that
yes something like that so then you know she was catholic but the husband goes to the catholic church in my house the only one going to church is me i don't think she likes to go she always fights with me when she goes
and he does not believe that god is helping him so i everyday i tell him you see god gave you that since today we were talking about
of katrina and he says ay god made that which
i could not convince him that it was not god that it was an act you know an act of god as they say but it was not
god himself he does not allow them even though the bible said that a lot of those things would occur so i was telling him to maybe read the bible it will show you what there is
mhm
aha yes
aha
aha aha yeah
oh from georgia on my god
exactly they sit there and once the father is finished they leave they run
yes
ityes yes like ultimately i am going to a charismatic group then i am understanding more even though they speak in spanish and i don't understand i can speak spanish but i can't read or write it
so then they gave me a hispanic bible and i forget it i am reading it but i don't know then i go and explain to them that i read this and this and this
that is what then they read in english to see if i can understand it but it's much too difficult the bible is is
eexactly exactly so i find it very difficult so i they give me some some passages and i read them and then they tell me this is this and this is this and this is this
you know and i begin to use it like in our lives and i say oh okay then i understand
i am puerto rican
yes yes yes yes i was born in puerto rico but i grew up in new york in what they call el barrio in east what they cal el barrio in manhattan
yes you know have you always been from georgia
i didn't understand what she said
oh from chile ah okay
but viaja
ah
wow wow wow wow
wow
yeah yeah
yeah
wow you travel a lot
yeah that is good that is good to move like that you see i live
i lived in manhattan then i lived in bronx and now i moved to long island and we stayed here even though when we retired we are going to live i guess
something about religion she said she talks
in florida because mi son my oldest son and my grandchildren live in florida
so i like to go i would like to go to florida to be close to them but to the time that i go my grandson will probably will be married
because he is already seventeen years old to the time that i retire is ten years more he will be twentyseven he might be married
i am going to be of ok
yes
ok
oh where there is work and what do you do for a living
oh oh you are at home with your children that is so nice
oh my god yes yes it is a lot of work right i do children's party i dress like a clown and now i am figuring out how i can make elmo's head
because i have the the bodysuit but
no
the head belongs to my friend then her and myself make the party then sometimes they request two and we could not go it can only go one person
so i am trying my friend is making it but the head is very heavy so i can not even imagine how we are going to make that head
so thought that because that is why i could not hear what you were telling me madam because one tape of and i say ok i am doing a lot of things i should concentrate
everything at once because sometimes they call or they don't call and and sometimes i answer or i do not answer and they had been they had told me that speech last week and i do not know why they argue the same thing
have you been doing this for a long time this
oh like me yes something like that yes
oh okay yes
ah i have a friend whose name is norma i think she lives in georgia also
yes yes yes she's peruvian peruvian yes
yes yes yes i've talked to her four times already
hello
she was talking about the religion what is the opinion about religion if it unifies people or separate them all the people should belong to the same religion or whatever
aha
i see well i think that if people would stick to their religion there wouldn't be that many problems they wouldn't go to extremes every religion
if people would follow for example what jesus christ said if they would follow his teachings if they would act like he did
there wouldn't be a problem
but when they start fighting that's not what he taught us
jesus christ
that's when trouble arises
the same thing happens to muslims
or the jews the principles of that religions teach us to
hello gloria i am paulina where are you calling from
in itself it is they are good things but when people become fanatic and don't accept other people you respect differences
i believe that there is when there is division problems
how great
yes
and it is true the same as when the
in one on one relationships or like the religi like a people like let's say what what happens in israel amongst the
between the palestinians and the
and the jews
it's sad and they go fighting
because for the two there are sacred places but they don't respect
new york i am in georgia
other people
ah yes
what religion goes is your friend
oh
yeah
mhm
mhm yes
that's the way it is i find that regarding religion many people go solely by tradition and
when one goes and finds the the truth
and really finds there one finds a religion that
ah
they like but many people who also go solely by religion but do not even know what their own religion is about
yes or they don't study what's written for themselves or anything
yes help when we start studying who would believe it's your own religion
the bible yes the bible is difficult the vocabulary that it uses even though it doesn't matter what language i find
mm from where are you from
puerto rican but were you born in the united states
oki don't know

okay well for me i only go to one or two concerts each year

younger and and as it is they are too scandalous so for that i didn't pay too much attention to going to concerts for that
ah
nice to meet you
aha
yes
yes
you buy music or have many cd's
yeah
ok
ok
ok
and
yeah
fine fine what do you think about today's subject
ok
so you say you play instruments you and your husband play in a band or group
okay
okay
practice and find that
the promotions and
yeah
yeah um ya yo i would have loved to learned how to play an instrument but i'm horrible at that stuff
music i like music its good for me its necessary for me i like it
i i remember songs lots of songs from
okay uhm how old are you
songs that i can let years pass by without listening anything else i could keep sining those kind of songs years after years
ah well to me for me it's that it depends on the mood i'm in i go for it so that it's
but i eh i have an ipod you know what ipods are
eh for me then eh i have like ten thousand songs in the ipod
so i have in all i have a list of music that only has music for the the dance music
i have a complete list that is only rock in eh english that is basically what i use when i go to the gym
i have a list that is music only in spanish and a list that is only classical music opera things like that
for relaxation
eh i have eh a list well to the contrary for me eh to study i can't have that type of music i can't have classical music i need music
that have lyrics because if donÂ´t if there are not lyrics i get bored i need something to distract me
twentyfive
eh eh i work with virus
in biology
so i always need something that distract me that keeps me alert
yes yes yes i put music but not classic
i get sleep i put classic music when i have many times to write a a report when i have to concentrate a lot a lot a lot
then even since i was a little kid always when i had to study i always was hearing to music while singing i could be reading and my dad always criticized that
is impossible for a person to read and sing at the same time but i donÂ´t know it always worked with me i always got good grades so
i suppose that
not
yes that doesnÂ´t doesnÂ´t attracts me a little the music whatever eh can
okay sorry
twentyeight ah me too
good evening
ahh
and and you
and above everything else i also really like live music
live music
ahh
okay
ahh
exactly
exa
exac
yes how are you
exactly exactly no yes i also i because me no ehm i play i play my instrument and my husband plays his instrument and at least oh maybe one that is festivals and things like that
there is a bar that is very close to my house where many people come to play every night nothing people seit no to and to play instrument
and there are open circles every night and there are songs of where the people pay and then on the weekends they come here different musical groups
to play every night from on on the weekends and it is very cool
i like everything
i like at least ehm that i don't like that way at least that if rap hip hop or at least music oh pop
so that if britney spears and not that i don't like it it doesn't strike my attention at all
i like oh i like a lot oh ehm at least rock in spanish i have a lot of rock in spanish and bluegrass music so
well i like at least from rock in spanish i like fito paez a lot
that is from argentina
ah i'm josma from philadelphia
yes i like it a lot
and from the american music there is a mister that we call it that's very good
and the one who died ah him too was a very good singer but more or less where i live there are many people who play
many of our friends that play and sing and have bands
and all of the groups that they have are they are very very good too
well at least this year i was at a concert of willy nelson
and bob dylan
and it had people of every age there were people that were sixty or seventy years old and kids that were barely ten or eight years old in the concert
yes good very cool it was held in a small stadium in a small baseball standium and there weren't so many people there because of that
was very very good concert
how are you doing
of course we buy music more than anything but also we bought a lot of music from groups that are not very popular of people we know
yes because we are members of one of folk music societies of philadelphia then at least there are many musicians
who are members and there are concerts in the homes and they do this every month
there was a concert in in a house of a member and we bought all those cd's
we see groups that are not so super super famous but they are good
and sometimes we have we have seen groups
that did not know they were famous and suddenly we're hearing being in a festival or something similar
and suddenly we hear a song it is famous
but
no no no my husband played in a group before they are not together in that group probable they will be together again
music yes well i listen to some latin american music and some american music yes folklore and bluegrass country music
but no we don't play for a group my husband sometimes plays with his friends but we dont really have time
to to compromise ourselves with other people
because of the job and that doesn't well it doesn't give us time to compromise ourselves that way with a group because if you have a group you have to practice for at least one day
week
okay
so if you have to dedicate too much time you can get a group there's a group that wants to play with my husband
but where do they get together they get together on wednesdays at night around ten and they practice until like 2 in the morning
does he work or study how does he have time for that
mm
that happens to me but whenever i don't listen to a song for a long time i forget the lyrics but the other day i was talking to a friend
twentyfive
and she was with her we listened to a song on the radio that i didn't hear in about eight years but she remembered the entire song
and afterwards they played a song that i hadn't listened to and it was some four years that i hadn't listened to it and i knew the song
i knew that i knew the song but i couldn't remember the words to the song but i remembered a little not much to me if i forget or not if not
if i don't listen all the time i forget the words i know the song but i forget the words a little
uhhuh
uhhuh
exactly
ah and for studying
yes
what are you studying
hmm oh twentyeight
okay
okay
exactly
hmm
i had a teacher
that said that when you are not studying something like you have to have to learn it that if you sing it you will learn it you learn it even
faster than the normal
twentyeight
ah
hello you are speaking with fabiola
yes i say the same
we bought at jcpenny
they get here little by little first some curtains got here then last night one for the upstairs side
then i got the other upstairs part and i still need am needing three curtains that need to get here
the ones in the living dining room because how you say i did not use blinds
no because the rest of the house i use blinds but not the living dining room because they are not regular windows they are big windows
then they do not exist in that size unless you have one made exclusive for them
ahh the best thing that has happened to me was meeting my husband
and the second and other best thing that has happened to me was having my kids
be healthy and staying healthy
and in reality
yes
why not it's good the thing of the good topics well that you find good conversation topics when you talk over here because they too also put the music yesterday there was the music
ah yes and it is entertaining you talk for twelve minutes and they themselves cut you off
yes they tell you that you have thirty seconds to say goodbye
and even though we have twelve minutes to talk about what we want because they are starting to recognize our voices
yeah and that's how it was working and they and they pay you therefore
we need to talk we need to talk about what they say or what ever you want the idea is to talk because that is everything the entire conversation is recorded
who is who
because the accent the system it's the form of speaking and
the stamps i have and they are inventing something
then they need people that have different voices
and the
yes the girls all connect using this number
yes they call each other at once at the same time
and and they connect well they connect well
yes but i don't know if you can make two calls at the same time
cool or not and and that is the topic that that i tell you to chat and and from so a issue of conversation
ahh that i don't know i can hear the voices of the beautiful kids
i can hear it very clear yeah
they are and what are you doing for them to laugh
they look and laugh and say you look like me nono you look like me
they are interesting ohh they are growing do you talk to them
do you talk to them now
do you talk to them do you talk to your kids
in english
ohh
in english that's good because they are going to know to different languages
about the best thing that has happened in your life
yes
imagine me with geni with two languages also she speaks both languages she can read both languages but nevertheless she has an accent and has trouble with spanish
and since being little and she had the first three years she was born here
but when she was two and a half months old i took her to chile and in chile the same
is that she only learned just words she couldn't say complete phrases because
we used to come here on vacation every year and one month here
and her father always spoke english to her
and of course and so when she would hear him she would hear a very bad spanish from michel
or a bad english from me
now i speak better english michel speaks better spanish and she can read both languages and she's better but yes she gets confused when her dad
and how has your life changed
speaks with an accent and a strong accent
but isn't that bad
it is not good no
yes from the time they are four months old children begin to
and do you have planned what you are going to do for christmas or for thanksgiving day
i see
yes
are you planning the gifts and all of that for christmas
the gifts are you planning them for christmas or not
not yet
and what's the best thing that has happened to you in your life
so the chi already the children are going to already be big for for christmas they are going to play already
how beautiful
i am thinking about buying we are going to buy the tree
live like every year we buy live
we are going to see i don't know look at michel i bought him a car
yes
a big remote control car
from 160 dollars i found it on sale for 50 dollars
eh like in james bond
but it's james bond and with remote control i am going to put it like a present from santa claus
but the best thing that you feel has happened in your life
and for jenny not yet i am still looking for something for her there is something that she likes a lot it's a game boy but a new one
that you you do not use keys you touch the little things and it moves
one super super new that came out
so i think i would put that one for her because i think that's what she wants
and a karoke
yes it sings it is good because at her age she is readings as she reads the letters and they get darker change color
then she sings the song
and yes it keeps her entertained and it is very good for her to read faster that is super great for christmas and my father inlaw
i bought eh a gift from jonathan
that is one
that's a good topic
for the computer it has eh to move the mouse
you move the mouse and it has a calculator
no no no the part where you move the mouse is a small square
and that
so that i bought one for me and one for us on the part of jonathan
eh and believe that that the other good idea y and don't know because more
no we already bought the tickets we will leave for arkansas for 15 a week
mhm every year we go for a week
oh yes
no but it still has not begun
yes
clearly but at least it is not true
they told her/him that it is they have the personnel if anything happens they'll let him/her know
that's how we later call you
but it turns out that she/he hasn't started the job in chile
it's still i also hey i got excited i told michel michel if we get it we go
michel yes yes but
eh same i think but i say how can we not go if recently we bought the house how you say
we sell it well i get giggly because for him is so easy like that just get rid of things take and then dispose off them
and for me is very hard
yes then to put together i tell you now also i still not put curtains they are getting here slowly
hi hello
i think everything begins knowing someone because if not had known him no
eh
and they are they are the living room curtains o
ah you did not use blinds
ahh
especially for
these kids must have not been here
yes because how
yes
for yes because if not if i had not meet the boy i wouldn't be here
another wouldn't have these kids nope i wouldn't have known you either
if it had not been for
yes
well here me i like them
ohhh
and they connect you and therefore was working
but uh what is this called there is no need to talk about what they say
ah so that after the computer knows that hu
and for him for the accent
mm
yes for the
ahh no idea and i hadn't called because i would say no no you can't call
much earlier
yes
ahhh
i'm going going to try then to call after a little later or in the middle of the day perhaps i don't know
oh look that also
in the same day
yes i hear them they're here they are
they are both laughing
they are are sitting on my laps and ones in front of the other and the look at each other and laugh
and one has a lollipop so he throws that lollipop onto him while they are there
oh
how
yes i talk to them i talk to them when there's time and i talk to them when
in spanish
and in english
so lets talk about memories
yeah because that's how they grow up with two languages
because yes and besides they also grow with not having an accent
eh
mm
and where did she learn how to talk she learned to talk when she was in chile yes well
ah
ah
ah so she was like confused
mm
ah
ah
the bad thing that i'm doing i mean i speak in spanish but the bad thing is that for example when i'm with another person and they speak english
i speak to them in english understood
because it is not but it is bad the same because it is not because my accent is not it is not understanda
and i know that they are very little now they are not going to are not going to but that oh the same all of this is being engraved since
is that
for the day of thanks we are going to go with my with armi's grandparents comes back something to eat because my
my motherinlaw is fixing up the house
so we are going to have to do to his granparents' and they together

but she said that at least no and all the things that
yes i meet somebody with this kids
mm
yes
something like that
oh
he would go
m
eh
because it cost you a lot same to find the house
eh
m
hi
yes
well and which subjects
yeah
oh ok i see
yep
alright ok i see
nop
if
yep
nop
yes off course
yes exactly
oh ok
yes but like i said in high school the subjects kind of get more specialized like chemistry is more advanced and physics is more advanced
aha
yes
yes
yes yes yes
yes no
mhm
mhm
yes i heard about that
Âdo you study or work
very good very good luck
but like you say it but heÂ´s barely two years old and right now thereÂ´s no need to think a lot about this
aha
mm
yes okay
okay
mm
yes she reads
yes
yes she already knows the order
oh hey that's cute
yes that's good
yes sounds sounds very interesting
i don't know anything i don't know i mean if i was in that situation i don't know how i would do it because i could never imagine how
i can give my son classes i couldn't because to tell you the truth i'm not so i didn't have an education to be able to give classes you understand
i imagine you must have studied something like education or something like that no
what did you study
yes no
aha
of course of course all that you acquired all the schools gave classes
mm
yes well of course
yes of course a lot of work at home i imagine
that's good but very happy i imagine right
yes your son is four days
wow a little
so young hey and uh then Âwhy do you live in the united states Âhave you lived there your whole life or
Âwho's this
okay
mh mhm
mhm
ok
ah ok
aha
ah ok
ah very small
ah ok
yes
hi annie i'm arturo
yes yes of course
and now are you married with is it with a latino or an american
ah ok i see
ah ok this from here in in miami i suppose
ah ok
ok
ah i see very good
and
and what what language do you speak with with this with your well it is that now you don't want to talk yet your children true because
he is twentyfour months the other no
Âwhere are you calling from
twenty three yes well no it is
mm
okay
ah okay
recognize them
oh yes
oh really
wow aha
very fast
also i mean like at what age do kids start talking normally i really don't know
from miami very good i'm calling from
okay
aha
yes yes
yes
yes
ah
yes but
of course it is much more difficult but i believe it will be good in the long run but not very good so far with the language is an advantage
the truth
mm
philadelphia
yes yes i imagine
yes
yes of course but children are very clever and then no
you know
hmm
well i hope she stays like that because then when she's growing and a lot of her friends speak english she's going to practice english more i think
ah okay
ah
yeah
yes that's true
yeah Âwhere are you from
but what do you think about her not having school mates
that's also not an experience bone
aha
ah okay
ah okay
the
ah okay
yes
yes of course that's what i was thinking that's part of the experience no to be in school with people you know
so i think that too it's important you don't need that when you're a kid because to have true friends is very important
oh ok
i don't think so
but yes as long as she has contact with other people for at least once a week only
yes there are many is that here there's a lot of contribution from the community right and that
yes i see
yes yes yes since in mexico that's not common you understand it doesn't happen at all
so i don't know anyone who has come out from that type of school you understand and i've always been very curious about how they do it here in the united states because here i do know is much more common there are a lot of people that
that come from home schooling oh well at least before now i don't know
yes yes yes yes
it can be very bad also right
yes of course but you have to be careful because then again is bad to over protect them
i'm mexican
it can be very bad
yes
yes yes
yes that's true and until what grade do you think to home school her
yes
in time we'll see
but what do you think i mean are you planning to teach him the whole elementary grades
okay
ah yes
so you've taught classes up to high school or what
hi
Âare you studying here in the united states
so i taught everything
so now you know the only thing is that if you don't agree i won't do it
if i don't understand the topic i teach it to myself and then i am able to teach it to the kids
so you know how are we going to say algebra
it's not that i don't know it but i could forget it
because i don't use it
so um you know before i started the class i kind of remembered everything
what is it that i had to do
so i could teach them
so for me that isn't so hard i know for someone else it could be but not for me
that's good
likely this time i know that now
they have classes for kids that can take and solve them on the computer
and they can go to high school let us say it on the internet
you know there are many many many options itÂ´s not only that
you know that one must
to register the person in a public school
do you know i know that these universities
have classes for kids too in high schools that can be taken in the university
therefore you know we have many options
and
no uh i have a twentythree months old daughter and i have a four days old son now
no but since my husband says you know that i'm a teacher
i'm always reading her books i'm you know singing her songs
so that she you know she's having fun but at the same time she's learning something always
so you know i'm not really giving her formal schooling
but i am giving oh i'm teaching her
little by little she already knows the alphabet well she knows the song
yes aha so she already knows the numbers
a little you know if i tell her one she can tell me two three then the next one she tells me she already knows that eight comes after seven you know things like that
yes not all but little by little
so you know like
so no i'm working but no
yes
mm
well
i studied yes education but they didn't exactly teach me how to teach a kid let's say how to teach a kid to read
all those things i had to learn when i was working
so i'm using the experience
yes but for that reason is that you know i for me to do it with my son
is not a problem because i already have the experience i don't know you know how other people do it
not outside of home
yes
yes a little tired now but very happy
four days
yes
yes uh my parents are from dominican republic
my name is annie
and in the nineteen seventy something i don't know exactly when it was
ah i believe it was sixtythree i am not sure
but a revolution in santo domingo
and they went to live to puerto rico
then they went to live twentyish years there
then from there my sister when she went to college came here to the state of florida then we moved to miami
and i had like i think i was five years old
yes my sister is ten eleven years older
then from there we you know we stayed and
eh i i went to school here and you know we made a life here
hi arturo
and
an american
yes i met him at university
no eh i went to
in
then i met him there
then
after ah
well
eh she she is twentythree months and the other is four days old
miami
i what we do here that when he is not here in my husband is not at home
i speak completely in spanish to my daughter
so then when he's here we speak completely in english
and like that she can know both languages
and and i get surprised because many times she says things
that i hadn't even realized she had already learned
it could be in english or in spanish
so she's already learning
yes
and mm i think it was she was let's say fifteen sixteen months
Âfrom where
since she's learning english and spanish
hey you take the kids that take a little more time to talk
so i picked up my little girl you know and her friends or whatever her little friends
eh she needs to speak louder than she is
ah until recently
so i knew that she could understand it and could speak
but he had to learn the language that was a little more difficult
yes yes
so eh but you know it i know that she understood
what i was saying in english and spanish
philadelphia
now you know i know that she understands me because when she doesn't know how to do something it makes her feel dumb i know
i see her little face and i know she understands me exactly
yes yes
so you know she understands it she speaks it
and
yes and uh we're not going to send her to school we're going to homeschool her
because i am was a teacher
then i think that instead of going and teaching you know someone else's kids i should stay home
and i can teach my own children
so
uh puerto rican
well
yes there are many programs here in miami for people who teach their children at home
then usually once a week they will be together
then it's like school they have a class that they'll have to teach in english or at the university whatever but as a school that meets once a week
so and also you know with friends and stuff i have many friends and family who have done that
mhm and i don't have any problems
known but also not something that
because to me that worries me too i want her to have lots of friends and all that
yes yes
yes yes
Âand you
yes yes
and also you know they have the sports of in other words the places in the community
yes so you know thing like that is how they how do you say it they socialize
so you know
yes
yes is you know is like any other experience is how you take it you know it can be good or it can be bad
but i also think how the schools are here also how the kids are
yes that also i would like for her to have friends and all those things but at the same time i think i have to protect her
yes yes
yes but for that reason is that i want to teach her because i can teach her anything but it depends how i present it to her
oh
you know
it's a little different than let's say what they show you in school
i don't know i haven't given it much thought since she's only two years old
and i haven't started
yes so
ah it would probably be until at least sixth grade
then from there we'll see because i don't know you know i i can teach her up to high school
ah
yes yes
well i i was an special education teacher
hello good afternoon my name is lorena i am here in san antonio texas
because because now they are bigger they have given me well so many beautiful things that maybe by myself it wouldn't have been enough to get so many memories and so many
eh positive and negative emotions then well well not everything is beautiful no i have precisely well i have a son who who has some pro a health problem and that is also very painful no
and and well this but nevertheless emotions are more maybe more like love and more tender and more eh well and the husband is there right the husband
that also has a lot a lot to do
in in one's life no and this
but yes i i would think that it can't be just one just one event
now a painful event an painful memory the death of my mother for example
yes yes yes or a son's illness also no that also
it's very painful but as i say you can't eh say that only you but it's nice to try to think about it no
eh yes
hello eh well today's topic is very moving eh
exactly exactly mhm
mhm your husband where did you meet him
aha because you are from spain
aha yes
aha
yes yes sure aha
yes yes and there's so many things many phases
but oh well at this age is when kids are more loving
mhm it's a very loving phase and well when they grow up they go out and do their own things and for example that's nice too but you don't get that much love as you used to
now mom well i had a good time and hey mom well mom this is more like a conversation like a different level
exactly now i said well it is going to be memories i said well memories are like precisely the most important thing that can happen in life because you live off of memories no
and they don't depend on you that much they are not that close
but it's really nice it really is so to you what is the best thing that has happened to you your best memory
okay
yes
yes it's true it is what i right now has been instant i thought that like more have past well have some nice memories in life about the achievements that you had
so like a person in the sports in or in the academic life or in the work no
right exactly
exactly exactly and however you go accumulating
memories in christmas pictures and in the high school festivals pictures and in the kids sports festivals pictures
it is like precisely putting together this life because it is like it was made of memories not
ah
mhm yes because this is like like a whole and you don't study to become mother you don't study to become
the human being doesn't study how to love but finally the emotion is more profound and complete no
it's difficult to explain them
but but one says that i had one because i wouldn't like to lose it
lots of energy indeed
aha
yes actually for example she because she's very playful
yes yes yes
that's how it is yeah yeah yes
and this now i understand a lot because they are that way and everything they permit to happen because they have a strong and active character no
that's how it is the best well i am a mom
i believe she will achieve many things
yes with with all the difficult things that will confront her the challenges
no i have a daughter the youngest is a bit like that and on top of being really good in her studies she is also an excellent sportsperson
perhaps her character could too
like also guide no mhm
and that she can get tired
yes yes yes she needs to get tired what ridiculousness
where do you live
oh in philadelphia i have my oldest daughter studying at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia
yes yes yes it is then in philadelphia
and maybe yes yes i would like to think about the best that has happened to me maybe it is that to have had my children i remember that at the moment in which i was having him i said this is the best that has happened my whole life then i want
yeah of course
yes but of course she will do it what did you study
aha aha
mhm mhm
that is a good decision
i support her i have to take a lot of vitamins to have the necessary energy
and now you will see how quickly time passes yes i celebrated my youngest daughter's fifteenth birthday yesterday
and now when when you look back you will have many more memories many more memories of what she did that will be yours because
they achieve great things thanks to the support that parents can give and from what is given what you are giving not like you are saying that you leave to one side
maybe your thing is more personal your career your profession
i want to be consistent let's say with this comment that i made to myself at the moment that something was happened but however there must be also other things
wonderful and maybe you can not select just one really
yes yes yes well i wouldn't have liked it
my name is mariza
yes
yes and it's that no yes yes but the children the children
yes
no
sure
sure yes the death of a family member or a loved one has to be the worst that can happen to someone
also
sure like the second part of my question it was that that that what would have been of your life if not if that had not happened that negative or painful event
i mean that it wouldn't be that person would be now still for example in my case my mom alive but my my grandparents both died a long time ago
and i didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to them because i lived far away so that maybe the would be that that what would have been of the my life would have been different if not because of course they couldn't meet my husband or my daughter either
hello
so then yes
sure life would be pretty different
here in the united states almost by chance
i yes i'm from spain
so i came here to study but i met him and i ended up staying and i've been here for twelve years now
and i have a five year old girl i can tell you my life has changed sure because kids change parent's lives but she is still very young and i still have some time
and so well nothing i know it's different when kids are older they become more independent but i still have to go through that
and sure
yes yes everybody says that
yes
yes it has also been hard for me to think abut which one is better and which one is but
well i believe that the same like you to to have children eh well i only have one and i don't believe that i don't know if i'll have more
was not not i mean i don't believe i was ready to being mother maybe because it was a big change and oh the pregnancy was really hard and the oh
the we have raised her my husb my husband and i here both alone then it was a little bit difficult but also was of course to have a kid change your life then so it is the best that have happened to me i say
until now
eh it can be compare with anything that's what i say
of course
of course and and why the the other questions was what could be different if i have not lived that maybe have not being mother well my life would be very different
i had finished the studies too had
of course got a more more important career or had travel more or met some other person but of course you never know you only can imagine
yes but
exactly with so much eh with so and i don't know the more time goes by more memories there are i don't know i wouldn't know which one to choose to start with
oh
exactly yes i have thousands and thousands of pictures all of them are of of my are all are of my daughter that's because the
it's easy to say what is most important eh because excluding that off course without that i don't know i traveled allot i've met interesting people that you can't compare with
with the children i guess
no
yes like i was saying to my sister she doesn't have any children and i say to her until you become a mother you would not know how is like being a woman
complete because they have like 20 years married but no they don't have any children and i don't think they will and then it's difficult to explain
it's difficult to explain one like they say
yes a had him because i say i already had thirty years and i said it was time to have one have one now or don't bother if we get to old because
of course to raise a child you have to have a lot of patience and energy and lots
for example the best
of all yes my daughter requires a lot of patience and sacrifice
and
she's very active more like hyperactive not like me when i was a child i was lot more quiet and did all my fathers said she is a lot more
she is more like three sometimes is
i finish tired after all those days but well she's like that she is like that one has to accept their children the way they are
and
yes that is what i think or do i wait for her
yes yes if i compare her to my niece they are so different i think that my daughter i don't know she has a much stronger character perhaps that will help her in the future to get ahead
clearly
yes exactly that is what we want we want my daughter to also practice a sport but we want to wait until she's a bit older because she's just five years old maybe she's much too young but
yes me too
she has the body to become a sportsperson and perhaps that will help her develop more and
yes
and and perhaps calm her
yes yes i need this because sometimes we go to sleep before her we can't continue like this
i don't know they tell me that it's the age
we are living in philadelphia right now
oh what a coincidence it is a good university
yes yes here it is a city where many people come to study many young people one of the most important ones that that is also another important things as well education
eh and yeah
of course i would like for my daughter to go to the university as well but i am still many years away from that
of course
me criminal justice well psychology but i did not finish the degree
well after i was pregnant the girl we wanted to raise her at home we did not want to take her to a day care because we felt that i don't know it's the traditional form that i was raised that i was with my parents they took care of me
we did not want to leave her alone in a daycare alone
yes yes it is good eh
yes while it is possible and now yeah yes yes yes and
wow
yes
of course well that is what i was thinking that and also i asked that if that had not happened how your life would have been different in your case not having had your children
it is it is
hi my name is juan
well uh you know i don't ok i haven't taken into consideration those those classifications
i can't understand them very well
i think they are uh a little bit complicated instead they should have a little bit more information about what they have
ok but in general as i no longer have little children
uh children well i don't worry too much
about those classifications however i worry because when we go to see a movie that's worthy that's interesting and not just any movie then the classification
i'm not so interested in that as much as i am in the quality and the comments i hear about the movies right
that's it that's what i'm interested about it's i don't know if you do the same if you always go with go alone or if you go with someone
right
right
the pleasure is all mine where are you
uhhuh
oh yes
yes
oh
uhhuh
yes
yes
there is always something
yes it has nothing to do with it yes
yes yes i believe that in that sense you might be right
ah where are you
oh look that very curiously
what worries me the most in the movies is language and the violence
generally because like you say when there is an exaggeration in language
or in violence everything else is the same
so when the movie is like that r well obviously it will have scenes of all types
those are free so then r appear more than restricted they look more like if you don't have much information about the movie it's exaggerated in all levels
yes
mhm
yes but look at that
makning making memmoryof the movies we have gone to see lately they are all
yeah
pg thirteen or something like that i don't know where to hold it because the ones we have around here
available at the theaters no
they are simply not really good
then no let's not worry much abouth that information because my kids are already teenagers we always go to the theater all together
we always go for the quality of the movie more than anything else then
the the classification they have to orieented us about the movies it really does not give us much information no
we don't take it in consideration
aha
aha
yes no eh
ah okay i'm in texas in san antonio
what
yes
you see that's when i think we should be involved in the education of our children
we've never done any acts of censorship we
we've tried to discuss or talk about the issue when we see strong scenes
we discuss them and we tell them this happens and when we are worried about this we say  hey that was really unnecessary they could've cut it out of the film that was rude
no we analyze it and so we take advantage of it as a way to educate our kids
it generally works for us it works really good it has i don't they are older now
and now he has good common sense about which movies to watch and which ones
aha
yeah i'm right here
aha
yes
aha
yes
sure
so they are going to find out about those things in the end they are going to have opportunities to see all those things
but what yes talking about those things is that censure or the information that that should be censured or
that type of thing i have never though of it has good because
well that there is too much information about movies that it would be convenient to go see with your family
and after the movie eat together what happens is and inform ourselves what the movie is about the message the quality with which is made and so on
no yes
because the restrictions that they put well like you said there is too much violence that can be found in cartoons
there are cartoons that are made for children and has exaggerated violence not
yeah exactly and in the in the in general i think that that eighty percent of the movies are bad that you must not see them
no and of the other maybe some are medium and less than five percent are worth watching
no but with those you have enough to have an an idea of that it is what you must be looking for right
there are enough it does not mean that not enough movies are not made but so many are made you don't have to see them all
right and then
yeah we try for example like knowing who they are before we go to a movie
about the critics towards that movie and then we go
its that's what we always look for we go to see this movie
yeah
and we've already made a decision about what movies and since my kids were little they've had that education because he like the movies a lot my wife and i love the movies so
never even when they were when they were little
if there was a movie sometimes we took them even if it was for older people right
and yeah maybe there could be some scenes a little stronger but one scene doesn't necessarily make the movie
so we tried to talk about the message Âright for example a lot of war movies Âright
a lot of war movies are for example saving private
ah yes
well my name is claudia ivette with whom do i have the pleasure of speaking
the pgs are more like that the pgs than the pg thirteens i've noticed
then i don't understand a lot of that
ok
ok
yeah that's true
yes
yes
yes
right
no i'm married i've been married for three years and i do have a kid he's 20 months old
oh it's a pleasure juan
so he's just about to turn two years old and yes as a matter of fact i'm concerned about that what we do well my husband more than anything
for example he if we watch a movie and we really love it we love it if it's pg or pg 13
what we watch the most we don't really like neither him nor myself to watch adult movies or those that
up to pg13
those or at times one that is r but the truth is that i don't pay attention for example if there is a movie that we like
we buy it and we have for example sometimes it has nude scenes or something like that my husband grabs the movie and erases that part
and we do it mostly because for example there are times when neither my husband nor me are going to be there so then the children might grab the movie and could watch it
so for that my husband will record some commercial or other thing
then really they can watch the movie but they are not going to see well at the best it will be purely cars or action
but for example if you take away or erase the part that is a bit pornographic because you see that always even though it's a good movie it always has to have some nudity
excuse me
at times it has nothing to do with it but
we have movies that are action or cars and suddenly up comes something that has nothing to do with that but
so then that is what we've done because we are going to have other children and once in a while they will be alone and we don't have to worry that they are going to watch a movie then
there will be no problem but
yes
yeah
oh yes because it really
yes
yes
no yes
ah i'm here in the state of idaho
yeah oh yes besides for example we have found movies that are for children or rather they are not for children but when
showing the ones that supposedly are pgthrirteen that is for children of thirteen years of age that can see it then but sometimes they say like you say vocabulary and sometimes they show scenes that
of nudity and that so then i say since they will be watching well
i don't know i am i am mexican
that and really there for example yet ah still on television they care of you and still on movies they still care of you a bit
i say ah i don't know i don't know it makes me
very fast um
aha aha
aha
no yes
in a place called robert uh and where are you speaking from
aha
yes
sometimes it does not say anything because sometimes for example is says
and and it changes for example and when you are watching it bang it's is different to what it told you
oh yes for example it says something like  it has too much violence and then it's not that violent or sometimes it is or not no it doesn't clearly state the information
so sometimes
you don't even pay attention to it because for example
those things that they sell for example to sell tv sets that that you see
that they remove or block bad words and stuff like that those work sometimes but they don't all the time they work but let's say well i don't really own one
but one of my friends does and she says they don't work they don't work properly because they sometimes block words that are not that bad they are not really bad words and then really cuss words are not blocked
wow a little far away
so uff
aha
yes
yes
yes yes
yes
yes
yes you see that's true that's a great idea i remember when my mom would watch a movie with me and we would always watch movies after ten in the evening because
we knew that we were always going to find
or my mom would take a chance to try and get ugly movies
yeah yeah well you see we got the subject of movies
the ones that are not made for children but for example she would say i don't know if they were airing a movie that had bad language
or something different than nudity but still like with little clothes on or when we were kids for example my mom would say
you can watch it and then you will understand more and she would say
that because when you say  turn around look away you are not supposed to see that it's like you are telling them to do so the teenagers will do it because they are wondering why their mom told them not to watch
if the movie is playing on television they are wondering why they can't watch it why they are not allowed to
so i don't think yes yes
yes
no yes i believe that
yes
yes yes it's true
well i don't about the ratings i don't understand a lot i know that there are movies that are pg thirteen pg
yea
oh yes and that is not and are shown during the day true
yes yeah yeah right
yes
yes
that's true
that's true
right
yes
right
and actually i've seen some that have more swear words that are pg thir eh eh they're like more violent and more
right
right
right
right
yes
good good evening i am joe
always keeping an eye on what they watch i don't want her to watch programs that uh will give her nightmares or will give her bad ah motivations but there are a lot
of permissive things also in the for example the movies out there well every time are i now think that it's more violent i don't know if
enough to classify because they are making very violent movies with lots of topics
yes
sure
sure
like the movie that is well the allies about the iraq war that i believe is about the experience the soldiers are having
this one with the colored actor his name is jamie i think it is jamie foxx
and then there's is another white boy that looks like eh is traumatized or something when he is experimenting in irak those things are very real and they happen every day there
and yes true
joe
yes
yes transfering many things from outside of the lie he told in order to invade iraq that is really ah now one looks and really no no
it is not worthy to do that more than one thousand soldiers already died
yes it's true
yes it's true so i i think that movie classification today is rather relative i know they have from thirteen they clearly know that x are
obvious true but i think that r these days is well beyond what is permitted or not eh eh that i agree with
allot of movies true that don't make sense for example you have a lot of gang movies that are gangs with lots of gangsters are the ones you see because like
they need to see the violence
yes very bad
and it glorifies it someway
yes and what if your name
and that isn't for selling to
yes that's why i see sometimes you boys copying that in the way they dress or walk and even talk or co because those are their heroes
and that isn't right that is is corrupting the young tose shows and movies teach them the fake values and isn't right but the
society the parents the family has a lot to do to make them understand those things and how to treat them true i to my daughter i don't when
i see something and i don't what her to see it i don't like i don't force here in such a manner diji saying okay don't watch that
or if not i try in an educational way to teach her why this program is not good for her instead of imposing it by force in other words
mm
oh yes
yes is easy that
yes
alex where are you from
yes exactly well in in my house i have basic cable and so there's no channel that that crosses the line
no my daughter is only five years old
so eh there's a there's a disney channel that she loves to watch and also we watch the discovery channel which she likes and there's another other
comedy program that are not that bad that we both watch together that she likes to laugh a lot she likes funny things
but when there are things that go beyond that cross the line well i don't let her watch it because i don't want her to learn those things
they make those things interesting when is not morally correct or socially correct
yes e
which culture is more
the videos
yes all of these things
oh yes yes yes of course i remember i remem
yes
yes
the teenage years are critical
exactly
it's the manner and reason and to think they say we were teenagers also i remember how i was in those years
i had my rebellious spirit and all these things but it's when parental guidance is most necessary
yes and if anyone comes to see it's like when they're all alone with their friends they can see whatever they want because there is nobody to forbid them to do it
eh but if anybody helps him by taking him the good way in about what is good and what is wrong that helps a lot to reason before doing
to make a wrong choice
exactly
eh what a memory yes yes i remember how couldn't i
yes
they believe themselves more independents that they don't need their parents anymore
yes
yes and young people influence nowadays is pretty big i am i agree but i remember i also was influenced by my my friends and so when i was younger
but i can see that technologies and such things are greater because really the movies back in time when i was a boy weren't as violent as they are now
there wasn't video games either television was more restricted neither all that modern violence nor blood or bodies were shown like the c s i and all those shows are pretty graphic classics
that show things like if they were real
well it's eh young people get use to watch that as acceptable but when i was growing up if those things were shown it would've been chaos
in fact it wouldn't have been allowed at all but it's true times are changing and that's why young people are influenced by it
in a big and negative way that this things are acceptable in our society and i well
i am from colorado ah denver colorado
i i hope that when my girl gets to that age becomes a teenager well that i'm
yes i know time flies
i remember when she used to be a little baby and now she's jumping running everywhere learning lots of new things being curious and asking lots of questions
well and what do you think about tonight's topic
yes me too i don't pay much attention to the classification apart from and i am at an adult stage no of course i have a little girl that
yes good evening
yes no i i think i am interested in movies and television thru the topics they have
now if it is violent but does not have quality it is ot a good movie but if it has some violence but it is teaching us something
like a documentary or something from life then it has value
because one can not deny the truth of life
one can not live life with blind eyes
yes
and those movies may be also a political critique
of the bush administration maybe it always been an administration obessesed with war
with iraq and misstrusting the public
those movies are very important because the majority of the people are very ignorant of the things that happen in the ge in life
what is your name
because you don't have information
the information that we get is all propaganda then is very important to see other versions of what happens in the world not only the bush administration's version
mhm
those movies are bad
because they show the violence
yes and and they the do it no for the value only to sell
certain peoples
um i me too i have a fourteen year old son
and every time he comes to visit me i have to set the control on the sex channels
yes because he's obsessed with that because when i leave i go to work and he watches that
joe
so i have had to control him he can't do it anymore because i i already have it controlled but i have it controlled because it took the step to control it
not because of the classifications so it is the job of each mom and dad to control the television that their kids are going to watch and not blame the classifications
do you have teenagers
oh yes a girl
yes you you can teach your kids but the truth is that you as a parent should not have your eyes closed specially when
they get older because they are going to have more temptations than what we had
no because we are not good fathers according to culture
because today's teenage culture involves gangs hip hop music a lot of sex and a lot of violence
the videos
and it's not easy to control everything that you try and one i try to explain the consequences if you do this
alex
yes he does that if he has sex with a girl there are consequences that can occur what can happen i'd like to understand
one has that uh to continuously talk to them about the things that the parents see because i i am a substitute teacher in school
they care a a lot about the boys when they are five six seven eight nine and ten years old but when they are thinking they need help the parents are not there
we begin to fail and these boys have a lot of temptation and
and its the teenage years where they start to do more in the life of a boy
not only when he is five or six years old
e exactly exactly then all depends on the education from the fathers the way they're into the young ones' lives no no the not the clasifications
the classification is just a number
yes
we must give the boys a basis what's good and what's wrong not only when they are five or six years old but when they're fifteen sixteen eighteen years old
ah uh i am here in los angeles i think we've spoken before about religion
and it is more important when they're fifteen than when they're five because when they're five they're going to follow the easy rules
but when they're already fourteen or fifteen that's another story friend
they already have friend they're already involved in culture
mom or dad must go to work they do not have always time it's difficult
mhm
yes
now that's going to be in a very little time my friend
time flies
we talked on the fourth of october it's been some time now
where are you from again
oh yes yes
ah i i watch television by by quality not not by classifications
hello marisa this is carolina from here from los angeles
it is strong it is
the issue i was just dying so i said
why why
but well thanks to god you're not alone i listen to so many people that say it's not they talk but they rant and rave about him and i say
of course the people have realized but aside of that
they think that the people are so dumb that they're not going to realize
realize of the atrocities that they are doing by god
sure
sure look you know that a short while ago the latin american film festival ended
and btw they showed a movie the argentinian but the directors were spanish
and then really interesting because you know that the spanish film industry has many types of movies and this one was a protest movie sort of
strong and even i don't know if you for some chance of life you have this knowledge of a page that's called eh tv for all
documentary where
and there you can see the television channels of
all the countries of the world including of course spain
uh huh it's called that t v pu eh t eh t v a four
uh huh a four four and all a l l like television for everyone something like that
this there you can see good and we randomly eh we have been looking eh a particular channel from venezuela
and it's a channel of course of the state but but really now the state not like before that it was of the state but as if it wasn't
and then now we can eh really see the truth what is that which is happening this that which never was said and especially with our president who is a person very
as we say in venezuela clear and rough
eh well well here it is good afternoon
eh i don't know if you have had the opportunity to hear him in some opportunity
exactly exactly then
aha same
smae as here
but you know that all those people regrettably then no they air whatever they want me
exactly exactly
correctly correctly and they put including this sometimes they twist
they twist what is happening and then i always meet people that for example say damn you what do you have to say about that crazy guy you have as president
i do mother they touch me the spot truly that is i totally agree with that crazy guy ah right what i din want to
say to you was that after they tell all those atrocities no
ah i said my mother how is it going to be listen today we have a very difficult topic
and i my god i try to have patience because it's a delicate issue
including now i didn't have any inconvenient here eh including with some venezuela people
eh people that have lots of years here and lack the knowledge about what really happens there
and besides that they are afraid of the idea that they have been slfd that communism that i don't know what that fidel and that this and that and
well i really don't know how how much knowledge you have but ehm for example the situation that we are living in venezuela is a very special situation
very distinct to venezuela that is that it doesn't have anything to do with the cuban reality with what happened in cuba ehm how i know i know they
had to adopt that system eh which were the necessities that got them to assume that system and and what happened during the time in which
ehm they were applying that because evidently there were mistakes in everything like we also have mistakes right now
we have been making mistakes however well it is being work on function of that like the president says well ehm clearly he has a claim against
the government not against the the country but against the government from here that that they are the ones that they
ay my dear mother because i am from venezuela
well they assume some politics how would you say how would you say it best arbitrarily ehm
exactly
exactly correct that is and if not then i extort you you you
aha then wow ehm
exactly exactly so it is a situation rather
delicate but i believe and from what i have seen that the north american town is waking up in some way i feel
and there are a bit more people that are realizing what is really happening because they have them like in a bubble
yes
clearly
clearly
where are you from
some labels continue bad ones in passing
correct
exactly that is what they sometimes say to me what are you doing here
i say to him look i could be in venezuela and not support the president or the fact that you are in a
country or not or you fled your country does not imply that you have a position
nobody knows the reason for the people being here
en eh in the opportune moment but that has nothing to do with the opposition because how many people for example in venezuela they don't live in venezuela and what they are doing is throwing them the enema
to the venezuelan government and the town
well that you don't have to be here or there to support or not support well it is a position to me when they tell me that it makes me laugh
because what do they do here and well it may be the same thing you are doing thank god that you are here and not in venezuela
oh ok
correct correct no well with all the gasoline problems that have really been well look
in a surprising manner that the people can not eh no they don't protest i say my god but what happens what happens with these people well
supposedly to you when it affects your wallet is when you react but it looks like no i don't know what happens or they change their car and they buy a more economic car i don't know
i don't know what happens but they don't have in general they don't have that necessity to protest under certain things
anyways i tell you i don't know all of a sudden here you were in pennsylvania you say
in philadelphia i don't know but here i have felt that there is a little more that like the people are like starting to wake up
i feel that they are rejecting the politics of of of the current president and and like they are seeing that really things are not like they are painting them because
me too i in the beginning like there was no i did not have access to that to that page i would say my god could it be true what they are saying about venezuela but i would speak with my friends
and they would tell me no gir what is that look and i damn really but look at the power of television is
very big well speaking precisely about the topic power
and and you know that now we are living a very critical moment exactly with with the united states and the our new president
and television is a huge power
of course
correct
yes yes yes yes
sure sure and what are you doing over there in philadelphia
okay
oh Âand do you think it's better there than miami
ok ok
right right and fi and you came here Âand what do you do
ok ok
and then o my dear mom
ok and whatever goes right
but Âhave you been living long here in the united states
Âtwelve
oh dear mother i have been here six years and we're about to come back god permits
yeah right
yes sir yes sir and
yes
ay my god
yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes notice that before i used to be a little like thatand and today i understand that is not like that is like us because we do not have
wow
fault of what our government does
then before i also used to see the americans like that like gringos well eh thst i understood that they are americans unites states citizens because this is another concept they work no then
well we are also americans if it comes to that
and and then after that i start to reflect a little and no no they are not northamericans no so it is the government politics what they do
they decide then we sure it reflects against the town against the country
but that is like that is the political state of goverment
sure
sure sure yes no and you have exactly you have your right to be in the democracy you have to the right to protest
i ah yes yes i don't i hope that this it it
it doesn't effect anyone eh the project this linguistic thing but well at least it's an fairly controversial issue when i heard
hello my name is my name is marisa from philadelphia
of the united states which is what
yes
mhn
it's very fe
no
ah yes
t v for all oh
oh
mhm
mhm
mhm
well i think so yes on television and de after that of ah mm ah mm the summits of the americas and all that was happening there
hello good evening
yes yes they air it here in in philadelphia you have various hispanic channels like telemundo univision
galavision and all that
and you hear it all yes and
is not that here too here we have government control we say that
eh only we only hear that no what they want us to hear
mhm
mm
yes
mm
yes
today really it is three hours earlier yes
hmm
of course yes
of course
yes that i mean no has been don in reality like the question says the world's police they are the ones that pretend to be
bosses of everything and and they tell you what is going to happen and if you do not agree well in a bad way you you you have to agree with them
hmm it is exact
with embargo with with everything there might be or the worst ways with violence ouch with war
this
mm
still a lot is lacking and that is what gives me more
very difficult yes
it makes me mad because it is so clear to say if someone knows two plus two is four and one sees how they are manipulating the people
and one and those and you intend to tell the other person but look its like this and this and this you don't realize so they tell you no because you are
liberal or communist or well you
they give you these labels and
bad bad if you are eh you are not a terrorist or you are anti anti leave we don t want you if you don't like
and i say but yes eh no this country not bad they are not country it is he the leaders of the country
yes
mhm
ofcourse
mm
mm
yes
no but also in spain it is the same what happens is that di different the left government but even if it were right it is another mentality because the
town when it is not agreed it is thrown in the streets and and they make manifestations and left here that is never seen i have never seen it
oh mhm
yes
yes
yes philadelphia yes
mm
yes
power yes
i am a spaniard
yes they are the ones that control i mean yes here

i don't know very very ra very radical
like that very religious very closed or if then
no can not it is not going to change so as long as that doesn't change and then
i well i with my husband here no mm we moved here one year ago ago before we lived in florida and ehm
i'm looking for a job we have we just moved and
we are in the process of um well i liked it better the thing is that the the work is better here on the north at the south it's really saturated
and Âwhat are you going to do about it that's work's first
he is is he works at the pharmaceutical industry doing clinical research uh
well
and i well look i do administrative work uh i volunteer and
well whatever i can find sure
well twelve years
uh um
yeah when i got here bill clinton was there the country was in a in an incredible period a lot of work everybody was happy the economy was going up
then the republicans came in uh with bush and everything went to hell like they say
it is todiendo little by little and is is don't know the world spain is already
when i go to spain all the world to to my husband that is american they look at him and he tells me he has much resentment because he says look at your country is
the world is destroyed it is taking over everything and
they believe that yes they beleive they are you know the owners of everything
yes
and there is power resentment
sure
yeah
sure
mhm
yes i don't like i'am spanish and i am american i one here the need and it seems like but me
eh and i have to persist and i have to deal with the government does but on the hand i don't know i don't like it it's a
sure well but theory practice you don't say anything or rather that
mm it's like a dictatorship yes
very
yes i and well i go through something similar what i have to say about the united states is not very positive either for because ah mm i am not for a leftist either in any case then well
i
i say i'm going to talk about bush because you see that i have so much so much anger i have to talk about bush and put it bad because
yes yes yes
that is what
mhm
no atrocities and later and and the whole throws their hands above their head and exclaims oh my god that can't be i don't know what
and no by next week the forget about it because
the press and tv move on to something else to to distract something to distract then the people forget
mhm
mhm
this is mercedes
mhm
and did you ever have a break up that was hard
yes
is hard always
mm
mhm
how good
so you have only had two boyfriends
how good that's best what for just looking for troubles
when ther is no need
from honduras
let's see it's been long time since eh i don't think i ever had a difficult experience let's see i think
with a boy i was with oh yes with the first bpiyfriend i had we stayed for about two years
mm i remember we decided that then i don't remember the exact reason we would break up
but that was ten years ago
i was nineteen eighteen it was
yes
and afterwards we well we let ourselves be seen afterwards that was not so difficult because we were apart that is he lived on his own and i lived on my own
after that another boy that i went out with we also had a few months also he didn't live with me where
we were in university where we were and he returned to his country of origin
and that ones was also easy because you stop seeing him and quick i mean it's easy really
mhm
in that way
eh what else let's see which other after that i didn't have any other formal boyfriend until s only yes the truth is that the experiences that i never had in a certain wa experience that i don't even know really thanks god
mhm
mhm
yes
really
yes
mm
thank god
you also say that is nothing everything can be perfect is true always and besides
ah where exactly
because there are people that are mistaken there's people that think that that marriage is according to the stage and and everything is peaceful
but and you live with the person day and night and you see it
is impossible well for it to remain right a situation like that that there is
yes you always love the person but is impossible for there to always be only peace well that's what i'm saying right
because one well i i am one it is to be human and one has to things that bother other people a lot right and
ve to any other people well i am not saying to the person in with that one is particularly but any other person well i know that
eventually well like that we have a saying no no it's a coin of the whole world all day the twentyfour hours of the day for all the rest of the life well
yes
mhm
and to behave
ah that's nice
yes yes
mhm
yes
ah no yes that bu and the the it's eh ironic that eh those are usually there are times that those are the most difficult relationships
for that for people that are in involved in that type of relationship
because usually well eh people are when they are in that type of situation it's there is like a very low self confidence
and then they think that people think that that's what that's what's better that some times it's going to eh what i'll be able to achieve
i have to endure i have to keep on enduring well
and then eh really it's not as easy as one thinks to ah he did that to me i'm going to send him packing no
it's hard rather because uh it's like no it's like let's not say an addict but yes to the to that type of situation that
and where are you from
the drama is al it's eh very true and and then people don't know how to get out of that cycle of of abuse true that's what happens
yes but
mhm
ah
mhn
ah
ay no
ah where the city eh the capital
and what do you think about today's issue that is it easier to break up with someone when you're young or or if age makes a difference
yep
okay my name is ibet with whom do i have the pleasure of speaking with
i feel that it's difficult when actually you love the person when actually you don't lover her i think that it's like everything else okay it's good we break up okay
to each their own
then i believe that when you really love the person but in this case i imagine is because you did not get along with the person
o o because i really do not know maybe they did not want to get along between the between the two persons i believe there should be more then nothing
communication in a relationship
or between in the relationship and if there is not one of the two pieces starts to loose the desconthere is going to be distrust and start
the communication deterioratesthen i believe this can can cause a break up but yes i know that i feel that it does hurt
mm well eh really yes yes yes because for example before i married my husband i was going with a person and for example eh
same it was not a long time but the firseh my first boyfriend
then this one
hello mercedes how are you where are you from mercedes
it took me a small while with him with him it was not too the same but it was the first illusion i had don't know and and i was already i had said well and even said that no with him i will get married
eh i will have three children and i was putting my castles in the air and one time he came and said you know what not me until it was over
how
i believe there was i had more experience to say until now everything is finished that i know to say eh then i beleive for him uhm
it was not very easy but for me yes
and after today yes thateverything was for the best because then i met the one that is now my husband and wow and he is a lot better
the truth
i don't know then
that's right and
and you
oh honduras
yes how did it happen to you
aha
aha
aha
wow
are you married now
oh
aha aha
aha
aha
wow i have a sister in law and she's from honduras also
yes
yes
aha no yes it's that sometimes i don't know well for example i think that in in my case eh with the first person that i fell in love too much
well it was a lot
more than than what eh he loved me i think with me and it wasn't too long i think it was like two or three months
but all the same i was like flying because they said ah this is my first boyfriend and and probably i'm going to get married with him and things like that
and in and he and he i think that he didn't think that way he used to say well she i don't know if i was his third fourth fifth i don't know
so he said yes well i'm not going to marry her i'm going to be with her and get to know here and that's it on the other hand well i think i think i was the one that was getting my hopes up because of that
and yes to tell you the truth yes it hurts
eh yes it hurts because i think you are excited and have a lot of faith in that relationship and when a person comes and tells you no well
ay no no eh i don't know but i know that she is honduranean as well
but i think that it must it must hurt a lot more when you already live together like in a marriage
i think it must be the worst experience i think of your life yes and i hope i hope to never go through it because we never know right
so i hope to never go through that up to now i've been married three years and everything is working wonderfully but everything is fine
a lot of communication and things like that
yes
no
yes
no yes
yes
yes
yes it is
so it is
yes the truth i feel i think that it has to be something of the truth eh very difficult eh to keep it so everything is happy right but
and i think that also that and i think that eh when you take your engagement for example you can know and accordingly you go knowing the person
that of course you're not going to know thoroughly right until now you are married with that person but it's but i think that i think that
if you see that really you don't get along with that person and for example i have known people eh that they beat up their boyfriends being boyfriends they beat them and they abused and and they required them to everything that they wanted then
i think that those relationships well nothing is going to come from nothing good because if they still aren't married
and now they behave so imagine how it's going to be if they're goign to be married no but in a little bit they're going to say you are my owner so now
now like they treat her then i think that that a that those relationships eh i think that they're not going to work ever i don't know or or change him or
or change or end a relationship like that i think that if it was a relationship like that well i i think that it doesn't have to hurt anything on the contrary of
you have to think it over if you have a boyfriend that beats you or that
i'm from mexico
you're going to rest you're going to say ah it's good we finished i don't know i thing that if for example everything starts doing it well and everything
everything is going well and suddenly someone i don't know must travel for example to another country or has to go to another school i think that that would hurt a bit
because everything is fine but only the third circumstances well they have to separate so i think that this type of relationships well that really really hurts but if it's a relationship that
that they hit you and things like that no
that's true
aha
yes
that's true
that's right yes it's true you're right because
for example one time i was in while in mexico i met a girl that eh one time she came by with dark glasses to her jo to work
from the city yes mexico city yes and
and i told her and now you wear glasses was it a cloudy day right and she had a bruise that her boyfriend had made
and told her you should i told her i think that you should not i don't know i told her but i think that you must not allow your boyfriend to touch you
because and she said well it is very difficult to end my relationship with him and i told her why and she said
i still love him
and then wow i told her what how can you love a person who beats you sometimes she used to come bruised and sometimes he
used to smack her and similar things
therefore as sometimes you say those type of relationships are the hardest and finally when she managed to do it i remember that she used to cry and cry and cry
every time that she could at every break and similar occasions because she missed him and all that therefore i think that yes somehow sometimes
some relationships i think that i imagine that it was very painful for her
mm well good i've already passed that stage and i am married but for example ah mm well i don't know the experience that i had was was very difficult
fabiola
yeah i know some people from maracaibo
eh yes yes
look and you are you arepa
yes
i know yes i young woman from venezuela in houston
no no no no no in houston in
texas no no no i work at home in my house
do you work
oh
what a great job
fine Âand you
yes but eh it satisfies you having
having power to help people
i learned the alphabet there in ah
i learned yes
but with signs
oh here my daughter taught me the alphabet eh and some words
not all of them some like  i love you and other
yes small words
but pretty
how to talk
in washington yeah
without listening but talk do
ah
how beautiful
what a hard job for parents
what is your opinion on the topic that they gave to us today about
yes of course i think suddenly more of love and all of that because love is like is
it is acquired with time
and and with and with enthusiasm then i believe that you want to maintain your family you have to want to keep a family because there are very few people who love
and thy are so young that the first thing that occurs to them when they have the opportunity fight split up
they don't work hard and they love each other and they love each other maybe even more than a couple who has been married for 30 years
Âand you
but they struggle day to day and they overcome problems they go above problems
and this is what i believe that they need mm people nowadays have patience and no
to think that if they decided to stay with that partner or marry that partner
well it is forever already though there are problems not to go running after the first problem that you found
and i twelve
yes
me too
but i had done nothing important
ah yes as i said stop me if i fall what is the problem
but now i think three things
ugh
ah i understand i feel the same as well
oh my god
i haven't touched it it hasn't come to that
it was pride
yes it's up to nothing
it only affect
ripe for the picking is like ready to throw in the towel
sure
yes
mm no is a girl and sometimes they treat each other well but they don't love each other
extremes
they are they spend all their lives together
right they respect and and
and what they wanted to form was a family and so
right and they are others that say love if there's no love there's nothing
because sure because nobody is forcing you you want to be here and and you fight and in order to maintain yourself
you could have a couple it's difficult and when you have it you have
the hardest after is to keep it going
but no it's that as time goes by you know but the important things is that you can not leave her
and that the system will also bring you to that conclusion
no he is from here
chilean
so easy i say
and eh well for certain things easier
for certain
yes i believe that for me it is easier because sometimes the the are very entertaining because i don't understand everything he says or he says it fast then it doesn't go well no no fighting had no point
a lot with him because it makes me laugh
what do you say or when we are very
uh chilean from chile
Âfrom maracaibo
carolina
no you know i'm not Âwhy do you know people from there
oh yeah yeah well you know that they have a stronger accent right like look and you mm
yeah
a yes yes yes and how great that's great because sometimes it very difficult to find venezuelans and they say no no in fact we know very few venezuelans this and that and i uh my god
we are very few here in fact but in about a mm about mm ten years maybe i think it has increased
mhm
mhm oh do you work at the hilton
oh i heard in hilton oh my god oh okay okay
okay okay perfect
yes i work with deaf children
Âwhat's up fabiola Âhow are you um
yeah well now in fact i am working with the parents of the deaf children mhm
listen yes very strong work
yes
exactly exactly and i was doing the same in venezuela only that i was using the sign language
ah ok ok chilean off course no
mhm
mhm correct but here is oral
okay
mhm
mm okay
fine fine Âwhere are you now
yes yes now i'm with the first oral part no i'm like at the other end of mm from mm
of the profession because this is an here the children are given incentives to talk
mhm
yes no yes because they mm with auxiliary earpieces are able to listen in
then what you do is that they train aurally so that they can recognize the sounds
mhm mhm yes yes that is like like a possibility they have well to be able to speak clearly they will never be able to speak perfectly him you you will feel the difference as her speak
but they will definitely have that option since that even in eh it's there are some parents who combine sign language with the oral part no depending on
depending on the grade of the auditory loss of of of the child if it is very profound wherein there are no possibilities even with the best operation then there
eh we utilize sign language as complement
mhm it is great work truthfully it is very very hard but it is very eh rewarding well in the end eh you have your your reward well of course you have to realistically put on well like we say put on the batteries
oh dear mother very far away
because in another form mm well hardly well they are going to achieve it well
well you see it a candle topic candle candle truly i think that the relationships between partners are not at all simple you have to fight with a person that
that is different from you that comes from another world another culture another way of being and then attempt to have a single project like
eh sometimes it is a bit difficult no but i think that love is the only thing that makes it possible for barriers to be overcome more than anything
only if there's if there's love and if there's a lot of disposition from the partners so that those those differences and those mm those eh tiffs that can be had at any moment
they overcome themselves you think so
mmh
of course
mmh
correct
i'm in los angeles
of course
correct
yes
of course
of course well see that i with mm my husband we ave we are going to reach eight years of marriage
and twelve imagine and and really we have had well two critical moments critical to the point of nearly separating and and there was a point when maturity there plays an important role no
in another moment in my life i'd have done it
aha
i hadn't done nothing important either nothing but look i don't see a damn thing
exactly
yeah
i understand but right now is that true what you think and say no but he has other things that me i'm focused on the good things that he has i say he is different from me he can't think like i can and it doesn't bother me if he doesn't think like me
but also that i don't want to let it affect me
no i understood exactly but unfortunately good the first was horrible because i thought that it was the end of the world and good i felt and waited a long time that one day we tried while i thought it was a good day but is that what's happening
we have we were married three weeks we had almost gone three weeks never in life had we lasted three weeks without seeing each otherwithout hablarnose and sleeping in the same bed
mm horr horrible horrible i said look do you understand this so it seems
hey it's not that bad it's very rude on our part in reality he said you know what to me i think that this is full of crap
it does not have to make sense if you want to continue with the project we will continue it if you do not want to continue we won't continue it i love you
i love you but this can't continue because you go for a day and i go for the other and the truth i think that i love you and that's why i love you
is this what i need to define it this way why it's insensitive on our part to live this way besides in this way i don't believe in god so what
we will working on it because irrespective of how serious may be the situation that luckily wasn't so serious but that neither side wanted give in right
we're just on the on opposite sides that's good and Âwhere are you from
fool pride because that
to nothing but the opposite
exactly then well fortunately we are back on track and then after we had another however this was smaller i think the first one was the one which really left us marked
and it went well well furthermore i was ready i was ripe for the picking as we say here i said stop i've got this fair
yes ready to throw in the towel i said nothing no no no i'm not going to co not going to allow it i say i'm not allowing you to do it i mean you're wrong
if something i learned from this life is to search for solutions to problems than can be solved
cause what are we going to do with a mediocre relationship i don't want a mediocre relationship as you yourself says there are people whom spend thirty years together and that's a crap of a relationship
that whom trat each other bad this look this piece of don't know what thing what what's that why would i want it
exactly that too
yes yes yes look is that a thousand things happens really couples go through so much that is is an interesting topic because you say
Âfrom where
that truly there is people whom look they like a lot each other but not love each other like well i got accostumed to live with him
exactly
exactly there are others that don't there are others that definitely they do whatever they feel like and they keep up an image
there's nothing there's nothing it's true that there has to be a big big love that's why i'm telling you because i feel that in my relationship what was possible was love
because truthfully with a situation that was so difficult like we were living if there hadn't have been love it would have no we would have broken up just that simple because it just wouldn't have made any sense
it doesn't make any sense to continue something that eh where's there no love well i feel that yes a lot of love and many of his promises that you were talking about to actually love
to be here because you want to be because it was worth it
exactly exactly
exactly
sur that's the hardest yes sir and to seek how to be constantly in that eh eh in that harmony that that like new things that we're going to do differently let's do not slip into a routine
oh chilean ok i'm from venezuela
eh
exactly sure i recognize that
of course of course your husband is also chilean
uy imagine like eh it is a little more i mean it is not that it is more difficult actually i feel that love can do anything
you think it is easier
oh ok ok because my husband is venezuelan and
and sometimes i say i believe that that has nothing to do with with nationality i believe that those are universal things
and what what was that you said
bad
that's funny
and how did you get to iadho like that
ah ofcourse a idaho
well my mother married a gringo
yes because of that we came we went to seattle in ninety one i had eleven years
but my dad stayed in chile and that is why i come and go like that
clearly
and a
interesting
something like that i am like we live together
of course clearly
yes well more or less in the for example i'm there all two thousand three
yes because or its like i am in the city i like it more city because of i am from the city or the countryl for example i lived in san rafael i don't know if you're familiar but
he walked from san felipe to the andes which is in the question more more rural and you couldn't imagine how
typical chilean country and that enchanted me
like a valley what do i know oh i like to be in the city because it is it is more hip what do i know there are more things to do
but i don't know this makes me
then
yes
but
yes i imagine
sure
and what you call it of course then i would come and go but more or less in ninety one yes and you
sure
yes i imagine
but the same in touchm is hard too
ah is not that long for nothing for nothing
and from santiago probably
of course
oh i lived
of course i lived there in santiago and in concepcion
sure
yes precisely sounds good
hello
because no i don't know of what i registered monday to do
and i didn't know anything so far from
i mean hello yeah
oh i wish it wasn't this phone it's kinda bad but sometimes
no but i was saying that i've been taking calls i don't know
well sure i started once and i got four calls but i could only take one
yes
well uh
right yeah well sure
i'm telling you it's been
hello hello how are you
fun they give you a subject to
no ah it must be
i thought i thought this study was to make a phone menu and stuff like that
so for hospitals theaters and stuff people wanted to talk about things about health and stuff for example
ah because you should not or because you do not want to do
ah
ah of course ah ok
ah ok i thought it was part of the study they wanted to hear words in castilian and spanish i don't know
no but no
of course with
ah of idaho very good i'm alicia of atlanta
of course is the fruit
yes
no no of course idaho is good
yes i was in washington near seattle when i came to the united states of course
and now i'm in georgia i'm in the south so it's as good here as it is for everyone there and i'm in atlanta
so even more to be posted there
but idaho for example is really rural whereas here it isn't
yes i would imagine myself there why not it depends
i bet the thing is being in atlanta it's a pretty big city supposedly life should be really great here you see
in two or three years
yes
and also all the stores and the bars and the clubs need to close at 2 in the morning
at 2 in the morning everything is closed
so the the reason is that is has the the sector like like the and that in atlanta it is called bucks head
and like and already like two three years ago there were some crimes and things and three people were killed they killed her three persons
around there then the city on top of the new major what do i know then yes that the people well are killing the
but the same is but it is like is like yes a city like that has to have by obligation
oh it is not of many cares too many cars yes
well it is that
sure it is not that the bad thing is that for example i would prefer one thousand times to have a a system so so good for the simple reason of the problem the
expensive and on top of that
good and you
a lot of congestoin
the sure it is like a horrible traffic that is delay like to any place yes like
yes the car
oh yes like over there
of course
oh
yes well
of course of course they are in or
ah yeah yeah
yeah
that's good where are you from originally
mm
of course
ah how great is the same like of course eh and gave a thing over there like this one this one the one that the washington university
we were latinos and
ah ready
mm
ah
oh sure
sure yes yes
sure the wheat
really me too
no
sure what i like a lot is when they believe that i am palestinian or asian if i go to some restaurants
yes like from middle east they tell me
and they try to talk to me in arabic i don't know they think i have more of of of an indian face or something like that but of cuorse and is there discrimination over there or not
oh but
ah sure
ah sure
and sure sure
yes yes sure
well over here is like super today atlanta and all of the south is like sixty pr cent black like that
yes
so it is like the fact that it is more diverse like that it is like much more ehm acceptable i don't know but at the same time to the south is the south of the
united states has that history of being one of the more racist places of the whole united states in fact here
there was slavery and all of that then the same over there a a certain minority of whites that hate any ethnic group and have their strange demonstrations and all of those things but
ofcourse
yes but
of course for example in the rural parts of georgia they saw things like were seen in the ku klux klan i don't know
yes still
and that those rare things but they are are very very far the city
it is inside the city of atlanta one is in a place more civilized and so those thigs no
yes by luck look what was happened
hello
and how long did you live there
oh okay
mm okay
okay
so now you are single
oh okay
okay ah mira and and what do you call it do you like it or not
oh
yes
ah
oh esta bien
oh okay
it's not like
well it's a super drastic change for me to come here
because i was accustomed to live in the city and here but there is a city near i could find all i need but the life is more
is more calm just saying
more calm and everything just it is not good because for example eh there is not so much crime as in a bigger city grande
but is kind of bored
kind of
here yes it's the same but not too much like at least chico is not that big
i've been living here since two thousand two
not it hasn't been that long it's been a short time
yes from santiago
and and you where are you from
from santiago also
oh okay
look what what a small world
and have you been in this thing a long time this thing of calling on the phone
hello
oh yes
Âhello
oh ok
oh ok
oh Âyou're uh you're calling every day
oh ok
yes yes i got called this week too but i couldn't answer
this week i've been kinda lazy
yeah
yes
good i am viola of idaho
to talk about to have something to talk about i think
yes i think so
eh
no it's just so happens that i was told that matters were so because you have to talk about personal things
because you should not like personal things
but you never know if another person is on the phone
so that's why they give you subjects to have to talk about
oh okay
all they told me was that i had to talk about issues of importance
have a theme don't talk as a pure head of sin
of atlanta
so if what
this yes you like it here
ah
ah
ah
yes it's like the countryside everything is really just the countryside
yes it's like how there isn't much nightlife there i don't know
ah
wow at 2
oh and why
oh how are you
ehm
oh
oh
yes well and like but over there do people use any cars or is there more like public
we oh well the same because to go out at two am is not that
if you have a car or something like that
yes
oh okay
yes
here is totally different
good good
well there are so many cars people have cars everyone because it's a necessity something like that
because there is no bus but
are like don't don't take too long to go to so many places to the city where i live is like half of santiago's port there are much less people because
because you knew that here things are like since the houses are much bigger they are further apart things like that
and no i am in idaho falls
in idaho falls
in i am going to a much larger city then
there in a much larger city but
where we are no is country
ah
of chile
no here is a lot of machines that's for sure
a lot of mexicans and it is more a rural place
they hire a lot of mexicans to work in
the land and things like that
then almost all people you see is mexican also if the people see you they think you are mexican
at least latinos they say ey mexican
then you are telling no no no
i am not mexican
yes
ehm
for real
uhm uhm yes the same but not the same
that is yes like everywhere else
the same is that more than anything it is with people that are latin but don't know much speak but
because there are a unch of people just the same that go to buy and don't know anything about
english so and then they have to walk no but people just the same you know like everywhere else they are sort of
because over there they are very discriminating you know that
oh okay
oh
ah but things strong like that yes
they fight strong
oh that's good
here no it's not something massive it's not like something semi heavy but no no like group things like that no
oh yes really
oh mm
eh
eh
oh oh how strange
oh i married a gringo
yes i was married to a gringo that's how i came here and you how how
oh yes
mm
well oh hello juan marcela
yes
mm
ah
and they didn't give you eh the attention
mm
yes but it can be cheaper
yes that helps what a thing
yes no i think that the whole system is going to have to fall before they do something different because i think that it is too difficult to fix it because there are
the costs of the costs of everything depend on demand and then if these costs are rising rising and rising
because there is more demand and because people pay it and then they raise the costs because people ask more and more money and people who work ask for more money it is ia vicious circle and then how can suddenly they can have socialized medicine
yes how is it going
it is impossible because all of that people already are like
money does not stop being like a drug you see they are already used to a certain amount of money
and then now suddenly they are not going to have it
yes of course it is
we would stop making bombs and going to war look all of that money that could be used
for schools or on a medical system of social medicine
mm yes
yes well nurses are paid very well because few nurses you know there are less
mm
yes tell me twenty thirty dollars an hour
i think so you are in texas and i am in north carolina
mm
no bu the difference is that they started right
it's like argentina my parents have all the medical bills paid
all medical coverage is paid they pay a little amount not so much
yes
yes its really expensive
all over the world all over the world
yes there was a drug my son was taking there and well when we moved here we couldn't find it
so we went to argentina last year i went to the drugstore and something you pay more than 50 dollars here
i bought it there for 12 dollars
yes pleasure
12 dollars same company and everything
and it could have been less if i bought the other brand the unknown brand
but i don't understand
mm
mm
yes yes yes
that's true it really is true
i mean i according to things like this
according to what specialty they have to operate here you know what you would have to do
why don't you contact an organization that is called the shriners
yes
shriners yes
eh because they help the children
now i don't know if they specialize in a specific disease or if they cover everything because perhaps
you can communicate with them and say to them he hears we have this boy and this is his condition and this is our situation
and perhaps they can help in some way because the shriners are dedicated to helping to paying for the medical care of children that they can't pay
of the parents who can't pay
what i know they say that it is twelve minutes but the twelve minutes seems like half an hour
yes perhaps uncertain but not to find out you see it cost nothing
and also if you call to catholic charities
perhaps they perhaps they have what i know a wave or something you see that it can help you in
eh i am covered through my husband
mm
sure
mm and of course he's growing up and then maybe that medicine doesn't work anymore they have to give him another one
mm
what a thing
and you you must live with your hearts in your mouth
and that causes a lot of stress
much stress
mm yes yes yes
mmm
and the children are covered like that so we are alright
of course he is ashamed how old is he
how old is he
oh it's just a teenager
yes do you know where you can ask at teachinh hospitals
at medics at teaching centers in medical schools
at those place plenty of times at different apartments
they check people who can't afford a normal consultation they take care of people like us who can't afford an specialized doctor
and we do not have
and they take note of whatever they give us and after that they charge
a reasonable account something we can afford sometimes they don't even charge at all
it is a problem no
of the month and that that's interesting i had to get an abscess checked it turns out i have something called add
and a few years ago i thought i had it but in the end i went and i had kind of selfdiagnosed and in the end i found here the teaching hospital of the university of north carolina
and they didn't charge me anything and they performed all the tests on me
yes
ah yes then it's that with the
with the university eh
ah but what a thing
mm
they didn't want to give you that information
oh then maybe now you can
mm we are very healthy but you never now
mm
maybe now you can
hello how are you my name is juan marcela
people like that in the community no
and well already the papers that they asked with my address and proof of work and finally they found an excuse to to not to not give it to me because they asked
me to give information about the person who was hiring me and in that moment because the person didn't want to give out the information no
and and in my case i have a son who has epilepsy
and then he needed some kind of tension of emergencies here things that
eh no no no they didin't want to describe me really then in the cases if i price with him he was sick one time he got worse
and then i had to to go back to mexico and that there he got attention from a doctor who sees him
and they prescribed him and then already once i ran out of medication eh normally i buy it in mexico and
it is a problem with the prescription and then a friend who is a doctor had samples and he gave me medical samples
no yes he gave me then yes it is something that we think that well there should be some kind of more flexible no so if there is a community but it is a certain kind of community
listen didn't we talk the other ay with
yes yes
yes
yes it should be
uh uh
exactly it is a problem it is a circle that works with the earnings here it is stronger isn't it
then the interest is more ugly
mm
mm mm well if they would lower it just a little bit
with that because over here i don't know over there where you are living but here if somebody has money it is the nurses and the doctors isn't it
then mn and well so here like that as they say time a good care with a woman that is around thirty years old for example no
yes i pleasure
and is a nurse and like that it passes when you find out if they really are nurses
yes yes to me uh uh then h ere in this case well like it does get offered in canada it is my understanding well they have much medicine isn't it
then any canadian resident has rights to medical services just to be there and they don't have any economical consequences
yes exactly
oh
yes this is one thing we should make at least paying something
having some type of social security but even that is really
it's expensive right i don't know how drugs are her but well in mexico is cheaper
and there is more competition there in drugs that's weird
oh
i have not forgotten you did we practice together no yes listen but i am tocan health
yes yes
yes
same yes
and in the case of mexico for example my son's medicine there's like five six brands
with similar ingredients
no yes ye and here there's only one and second that in the literature is not the best and listen but only the laboratories i thought that all the american laboratories well
so at the time of competition well here there's a monopoly
big interest in everything no
mm
but
do you have social security here are you covered
yes
mm mm oh yes
yes i already know i already know
mm
mm
yes
uh uh uh uh then yes he sees yes
yes he knew of that he hears what already it was time or what
ah i noticed that yes i only knew and thought it was for me and i much smaller without you tiring and for more style
mm i am going to crash
uh uh
uh uh uh that yes
yes yes it's very simple because in reality good on the one hand the maintenance is a medicine that this person who helped me with the sample says no man this
here they give them to us you have no problem just go to some community center or something and
there are many samples and but knowing a bit more about the advances is that i can give the medicine that we think that a deeper diagnosis could improve the life of my son with
with the epilepsy no
because it was under control but lately it has been nearly two years in which it has been uncontrolled it has been out of control
and well he gave me he gave me yes yes they gave him another one the potentialized it and it didn't sit well on him and then well what can you do he had to stop using it and return to the basics
yes yes we was very ill
yes yes well so you know it's a matter of experimenting
well yes sometimes yes
ah well we we are not
always yes
the life even if you don't say it your always looking after him all the time
no afterwards you know that you're always hoping that id doesn't happen well i don't know that that it happens really no but well that's a trauma but my poor son because he's a teenager so
it happens at school so he feels really bad
yes it is a heavy load it's a really heavy load for him
17
yeshey getting back at subject i think there must be a a good ones her
system of
oh
yes
we are not covered it is a problem because well something can always happen no
mm
oh i see
hmm
yeah
yeah
ah really
so everything is very well to which orientation are we going right in fact the place i went to precisely is called university system healthcare system or something like that but
then it's precisely there where they bounced me
i told him
mm uh uh then they told me no you have to give us information i had a letter with my earnings and so on no
and him yes and the other day i went precisely i went to an ah office in which supposedly they gave you some type of i mean pension for
but not that we need the social security of your employer and then that's when they didn't want to anymore
no but not me but well now i have my social security myself
yes employed
well maybe i'll go
uh uh
hello how are you my name is john
so more than once we said that belongs to the institution where you are no its more than a tool work
but that tool is very personal seems like a car no
yes yes exactly besides as i'm here in texas
i feel that the automobile culture here is like a reminiscence of the culture of the horses too
no it is like a horse it is something like very very very personal very close
over the course of one's life here we take care of them and it's very important just like a horse from that time no
for some years yes because if they say no the devices that have to do with communication are the most important in our age like computers
eh as permitted by the information management and everything no
but
yes
i am in san antonio matt i think we have spoken before you are in philadelphia
exactly and here the working people are like in those days like mules no they need a pickup truck
pick up truck no give and do not leave if you notice like there's a work culture that's very very important
and the computers okay well in all houses there is television telephone and computers practically no but but like that there are other dimensions no of the technological question then the car seems to be
the most most important
ah what a what technical question technology is most important in your life what is that which we are discussing right now if it would have to be the car or it would have to be the computer what do you think
uh huh exactly
uh huh
uh huh
yes yes
you have your cellphone
oh look its a placer talk with you again
yes notice that yes it's very important what you've just said a while ago when i worked i had a kind of work in which the computer was the most important no
and well in the computer there were the messages always it was in the internet the mail more than the telephone neither cellphone nor anything no
the computer was the most important
but now with the type of work that im realizing the auto is the most important the computer because the auto is what let you reeel type of work that im doing is more
more physical no then the auto is converted in the ins in the apparatusmore important and the computer for a second diagram also is very important
but of course is by the type of good work
yes yes
yes yes that yes
oh yes
yes hm yes no maybe here yes for the distance that needs to go in the job the auto is fundamental
hey everything is fine what do you think about today theme
but yes in in the city i think yes the most important and depends in the job also so hm maybe it can be a computer no then
the the next question or or the apparatus of communicationno how you say the cellular and
and that and hm and the other question is if you consider that those hm these technologies will convert more into a problem than than in
well what type of problems would it have no like you just said with the car the problems that have to do with parking
no here in texas there is not is not where i am there are no major problems no with parking there is a lot of space everywhere no it still does not have the
let's say those problems here but but in the end i don't know i don't know what you think above above everything i would say that well in regard to the care issues with cars and all of that well like it is not seen as a large problem unless it is
we could consider as a problem the interests created around the the auto industry and like sometimes they seem to affect the same technology development of the
of transport no for example
yes
yes yes yes but yes
the theme is the technical devices i mean the technology the devices that you use more and you depend of them how do you consider these dependency
since
yes
exactly yes well as they say as well with the auto industry no is the auto industry would have advanced technologically as much as the electronics industry maybe the car could transport us with
one hundred kilometers with only one liter of gas
no and instead of costing let's say twenty thousand dollars it would cost you two thousand dollars
if that was the case no but like technology in this case industry it has its own interests it like moves on you know what they're talking now about hybrids
that at lot of them say that they are not affordable that it's really a matter of image that companies do and when it comes to see the the return tables
of the hybrid cars well i though they would be a lot more efficient but i think what they've achieved is a minimal efficiency
no no i don't think they have a real hmm that they are a really big technological breakthrough given the efficiency that
excuse me
and how consider the technology question no in your daily life if it become more in a problem than in a solution or something like that
no i don't think it's so important taking into account that the efficiency they show is not radically different from the other cars' i mea
according to the tables an economical car will give you maybe thirtysix miles per gallon
and a hybrid can give you fifty
uhm well
aha
yes exactly and and sure and but at the same time for example with those autos of ehm there have been small cars that give you almost the same mileage than the hybrid and they are not hybrid isn't it
by small cars new that are not in the northamerican market that are in the european or latinamerican market where they have to be much more efficient
and smaller no so if we compare the costs of a hybrid against a smaller european car or or of teh ones that circulate in latinamerica so then
no it is much more expensive to have a car which is because of the initial cost and why it will be saved a lot in in gas it ends up
being less than to what a car has a good economy car no
its the same issue that i was thinking sure they must added no
european
yes it is yes
yes i precisely years ago when there was the problem with petroleum in the eighties or something like that i recall
i thought that it there was going to be a change in the culture because they started to to develop smaller cares here in the united states
i thought well there is going to be a change in the culture but that was a thing of only the moment no it seems because it has some huge cars they continue like
exactly so yes if the cars seems to be so important no then i thought better is a computer bu no
ok exactly but sometimes seems like a personal element depending of the case so it can be a car no because the computer is a tool every time more
hi good eh matt here
why do you need to look after the car yes do you know
ah
did you used the horses more
yes
yes
yes because here in texas yes because up here in texas
you need the car do you know for work
then
ah yes yes
i see
yes and you are
yes but the questions on the subject were which
well for me it would be more my computer and my cellular telephone
because you know because i have my cellular and i'm always with it
and okay i have become accustomed to having a cellular telephone you know
before i didn't have a cellphone until i was like twenty years old but now that to that i live in philadelphia in the city and that i'm not always at home for
i'm not always going back home for for you know to look at my messages
okay always always i am always i have my cellphone
i think that it's very it's like surprising that almost everybody has a cellphone here in the united states
yes
yes
yes how have you being
but now
well for me i think very well yourself and yourself was working for texas and obviously you know there is more hm how you say i undertand that there is more like lands and someplace there understand
way more space
for in the city having a auto it can be convenient as well
because always you have to try to park and to have to pay a lot to park and the gas station is not close by and i do not know it
is more one problem that one torque that one help obviously understand
it is better to have an auto hm i think
aha clear
aha
aha
no i didn't listen what is the theme
aha but don't you think as well that it is that it is very like great that that has changed like in sixty years
so we look how seventyfive years in the past there were no cars but these days almost everybody has
and the same thing with the computers they have they have computers that are not going to let come out to the market until like ten years because
because they have th the things very advances and the things have not ___ have not _____
gotten paid for their development costs you understand me i don't know how to explain it very well but
aha
yes
yes
yes that was a very important breakthrough
you don't think it's an important breakthrough
this include cars
ah
yeah
no ah yes there are cars now like like the ford cars
the pickup well the pick up trucks no because they are changing them so they can be more efficient you know
but but the expedition and those huge cars and that spend like that you know it can only run like around twenty miles eighteen miles per gallon something like that that is a huge expense
oh yes
and why is it that
why is it that the united states is one of the few nations that has this that only here you have those huge cares you know
over there in other countries everybody has small cars that well different different culture you know but
ah aha
yes because it is a machine you know
yes but
yes the most obvious its the computer but its not the only one
oh
yes that's why the same things you buy a car and always you are using it and always you have to mantained always its a part of your life
ah faviola hi
so uh i think that it's ok that they rate the movies how they do i think it's the responsibility of adults even where their kids can watch tv
they are doing their job them of the movies and
it's his business you
yes today the one that wants the one that wants to see he doesn't want to see him anymore it is not their responsibility they see
that they sell
it is what they do it is not their fault it is the fault of those that buy it
yes
yes
yes
exactly
how are you
mm i believe also that i agree completely and the other normally the children have access to television when the parents are out
the kids are alone
and there is not father to teach them or tell them you should not watch this you should watch
sure no because you don't have any idea
exactly
sure
no and also
yes also when the children reach certain age mi son was fifteen sixteen seventeen years old and he tells me don't worry because you did better than you could do
ah it is twenty five percent genes and education the rest is the decision the decision of my life
of course then i learned oh wait no eh oh i was and
great it's sunny but cold
my cellphone was ringing okay okay let me answer
eh don't hang up on me because we have to talk for twelve minutes
the i only went to turn it off
and about people i think about movies i love to watch horror movies
but there are times when the when when i get scared i'm an adult
i get scared and i go find out horror movies
yes
yes that's why that's why i respect what my son told me that time fifty percent is responsibility
of of the individual of the person eh you already did the best you could but then comes the time for the young people of the past to be eighteen at the
that some are much more mature than normal
cold
and they starts seeing rrated movies
at around fourteen and fifteen years old and the pgthirteen the kids that are eleven and twelve years old are already seeing them
and even sometimes even the little ones and even sometimes the much younger ones because i remember of jenny's little friend who used to watch harry potter and it's
pg thirteen pg fourteen and then i say that jenny doesn't like it because she gets scared
she gets scared with the monsters and all that
but i am in accordance that the major part is the criteria that you form and that way in the end take care of them and not let them watch television when they are by themselves
don't leave them alone with the tv
but it's the television more then
you have to have a formulated criteria to go and see some movies
aha in the same school they show them movies
yes
they show them documentals
keep going like the superman kid that went up to the window and kill himself
it wanted to fly no i don't want to aks you a question
eh did you read the rules for this game the telephone game
um i was wondering ah who is this are you ready for christmas already
of course about your birthday no
that's what i was going to tell you
cooking and sewing sewing that thing that you did you gave that to me
not that thing in the table
oh because they are
yea i've talked about it and i've talked about the uh one i remember specifically talking about was about violence
that is beautiful
itÂ´s andreitaÂ´s birthday too or three
oh now i remember it was about three days
and what did you buy to miranda
oh itÂ´s nice
oh thatÂ´s nice
what a feeling
and do you know who else's birthday
the same date
until i remember when i was there
that it that they didn't like the idea of going to see movies and i told them that the world that the world is it has violence
your fatherinlaw yes
the the juan luis sandra's younger son
also the twenty nine i also remember that more or less in the same date i remember that everybody were there in the same date
no you went to the carlistos' birthday and to to the girl's
not you went once you went to chile and left to her a present that was for her birthday
okay that was other birthday she is three
yes for her nephew who came later
no but sandra won't throw a party this year for her birthday
no she said that family only because they will buy something better for the kid so
she makes really big parties so
it's always had it and i've had the chance to teach children about peace and love with the tv or or in the world and later when they go out into the real world at school
she spends too much in that and that's why they can not buy the kid whats he
they have to decide between the two things so this year they decided that only the family
of course for a better gift
the smaller of all
and he always says that he doesn t want any clothes
he doesn't want books only toys
they find that that kids hit each other that they don't know how to defend themselves especially when you have only children
i'm ana maria
i agree the respon the most important responsibility of parents
they are earning their money what is your job
doing his business yes
of yes
yes
yes of who likes the product because of that
with you it is the maximum responsibility if it is violence sex whatever it is protect a child the biggest responsibility is of the parents even with classification
because there is a classification of a movie for example pg thirteen
and you have a small child of that age and you let him watch that movie it is your responsibility
it is because you let him and you thought what can be done isn't it true
hello faviola
then because i the the the association o o o whatever it is they one who puts the classifications already has it then
i believe yes we believe more or less the same thing in that faviola because in the end the responsibility of raising taking are of and wanting them to see or not see
your sons or your family eh you as a mother or your husband as a mother
exactly
mhm
or if they go to a sleepover you don't know either
if they go to a sleepover and the watch a movie they watch a movie and they don't have any control at that house or whatever
you don't know either
i believe it is important to give to your children one that they respect those signs if yone give them good principles at home one as a famly then teach them things
that really i don't like or why i don't like you watch or you are nor ready or the time will come
fine and you how's the weather there where you're at
what because as they say they can not have them in a crystal box
go exposed
mhm
look with that that
mm
okay
yes
okay ah
ok
you you scare yourself
sunny and cold ah
okay okay but your responsibility is to watch it and you yourself scare yourself
ok well i don't like them and i don't watch them i don't watch any of that type that's why it's also my decision be even though i'm old enough to watch it if it's too violent i don't want to watch it
yes
yes
mmm
yes there
already thirteen already
yeah
yes
yes because because
it's bad here it's really cold here what do you think about movies have you already talked about that subject
but imagine the same we can't control them
that's why i'm tell you you can control them you can't see this movie because of this and this reason because you need to be more mature or whatever you want to tell them it's not true
yes and that's why i'm telling you that you don't get nothing out in telling them you can't see that no because there will come a time in which they go to the house like i say to a friends house
or the same school but the same school is under a little more supervision because that's another thing because becacuase ther is a goal
but what i fear the most is when it goes to friend's houses and the have the television right there that's used a lot or the computer or whatever
and they have access to the information without the parents no without tha parents having any idea at all and they are in the  piece and the parents think they are listening to music or whatever
maybe they are watching something nonadequate that's why i say i mean if my son or daughter or whoever
is presented to that situation it needs to learn to value itself and learn to answer to that that's what i say therefore trying trying to give the values of the house
my of course because you know they are not ready for that
aha
i've talked about that subject before too
yes ok
yes yes yes i'm getting ready buying the presnets for the family but now i have i have another things in my mind
yes but i'm getting ready buying presents for all the famliy at least for the nieces i have them ready we've bought you the presents then there is only the adults left
buy things for the adults an antencion although i'll make most of the presents
i'm going to cook yes ah
yes also for some children too
yes the the yes also but i donÂ´t have time yet to wait until middle of until the middle week of december to do it
because i donÂ´t have time before
yes so that is what iÂ´m going to do thatÂ´s why iÂ´m going to do some gifts but for example um andreita that is her about to be her birthday soon
two days before miranda
mhm
yes itÂ´s the twenty five or twenty four i donÂ´t remember
three days then from the twenty four so i have a little gift for her i bought her the same as miranda so uh
for him i will a screen like those that you draw and then you erase
because she likes she already knew them and she likes them she makes little dashes and then she erases them and iÂ´m not going to give them to her yet because they are very small and she puts them in the mouth
but the screen and the pencil yes i will
but yes because little things like this
sure see the you really enjoy to do that kind of things then i bought the same to andreÃ­ta and with that already
okay who
who
my fatherinlaw that
mhm
it is true who
oh yes okay
i don't remember that he was in at least i did not know
i have not gone to any birthday in sandra's house i was to one pure i don't remember really
eh was in april so i went to chile in april
and i left the gift in yes i left the gift in that place
of course he came yes he told me that he received it afterwards from her but his name no
no no okay
yes it's true
it gets away from her hands yes
uh huh
what he really wants yes exactly
so he could get a more special present
juan luis is the big one or the small one
oh yeah
oh poor boy
tamara
then what do you think about what they show in the movies the
aha
aha
yeah
no i am not here on my computer i am sorry
ok
yes because there are lots of movies so i have noticed
yes i like a around here where i live there uste to be one of those ah like hollywood video or blockbuster but it was like
smaller
and they had movies like the ones they're talking about documentaries and stuff but they had to close because since the big stores are around people won't go to these places
yes and you
but those are the best ones i can find movies i like yes my husband is from america but he likes international movies too movies that have more
more important things to say
from time to time since i have young children sometimes they want to see some movies and we take them but usually no we have before we used to go to the movies two or three times a month
but now we reduced it so it's once or twice every two months
yeah exactly
i'm from panama
oh okay
then if it real is real
yes right what you say i am here my husband and i we watch news
because every time you see something or they put on something really stupid
i am in the state of washington seattle
or the do or they exagerate a lot
because when i was we would be in panama before noriega got out of panama
and we were overthere and my husband you know that white man white bought paper with my dad is dark and my mom is white and i came out dark like my dad like what
when we went out did you know he was american
we would go in both we would go in for whatever we had to go he to go to the military base and i had to go with him or something like that
and suddenly we got home and we turned the tv on and there were a bunch of stuff going on at pananama and i looked at him
Âhey weren't you and i over there this morning i don't remember watching any of that over there
and the next day it was the same and i say Â¡oh what an exagent i think they where showing the things that happened last week and exaggerating like that Âwhat
since then it got like he doesn't want to believe what the tv says
the news none of that that's what i tell my kids don't believe everything the tv says
ah yes
because it's not true and this
right
that was the documentary where they spoke about that men that got his head cut off
it isn't it isn't remembered
aha
oh  del churillo
yes where there was there where the police station was the part of the police station
yes that
no no because as i tell you i donÂ´t get to much in that news stuff sometimes
tv
yes
yes theater
aha
tv or tv for all
with
ok
ok
aha
yes
say
no maybe but i don't remember
yes this is i believe my twenty third call
mhm
some
aha
yes and this is the second time i do this service with them
yes
yes i are
carolina
no did you get same mail right aparently this is going to continue from what you can understand on the mailing they sent
rather yeah tell me
tell me well i am going to tell you honestly i have more than a year since we stopped seeing movies movies in the regular movies and we switched to the cinema
not too  conventional
we switch to movies for example in the case of the movies no just like on television now we see movies kind of documentaries this eh with another kind of message then
you watch movies that are in in eh what do you call that festivals here there is one for example recently ended the latin american international film festival
eh it was
hello
ah ok this approximately a month or less than a month because since a long time ago as i tell you we decided we were not going to continue wasting time
time in the majority of the cases really they are movies with a rather stupid and absurd content and well and we made the decision well that we didn't we didn't want to wast either time or money
tamara how are you uh
eh watching a type of movies that really don't give you anything
yes
ok
sure
exactly exactly
yeah
okay same here we used to go more or less once a month we went to the movies very often very and some day we watched a movie so
stupid so dumb that i felt angry at being at the theater i was thinking what are we doing here what waste of time is this
no no no and then we started getting information about other kind of movies and well we changed completely to that kind of movie actually right now we are in
in one of those phases we are kind of intellectuals now because we arrived at that point where you feel like
well well where are you uh
what are you doing i mean to watch this i honestly prefer to go to sleep or do something else instead of not all movies there are some that have
a different content that's worth watching but lately i feel they're making movies just for the sake of making them
it's like well he have to make 10 movies we'll make then movies it doesn't matter how or when just
making them up as they go along where are you from
ah okay i'm from venezuela
yeah yes
we say that to the  spot no that good yes make the movies how you want but if some come out good and others if they are not they are not
honestly no and the same is happening right now with the television we had cable and recently in a matter of a month we cut it off because no no don't know all of sudden like
that we got against that we see that there was a lot of manipulation in the media they only give you the news they want and hide what they want
eh then that is a level of news and the movies then yea how no it is not a good money not really very good
wow i am in los angeles
but they were repeating and repeating and repeating oh my god what is this we are paying for this then is kind a like annoying right now we have kind of annoyed
with the means of communication we are like this yes yes
i believe aja
exactly
exactly
just imagine
logic logic
of course
exactly
exactl
yes it is just incredible
exactly
exactly
look incidentally i borrowed a movie that's called the  the some like  panama's deception or  panamaÂ´s defense
that's just when noriega's problem and everything else we were watching the whole documentary and i was like it's cold because i would never had imagined that it was so sad and so
so ugly what happened
and oh yeah
you know i can't remember exactly i don't remember but what i can remember is that night when they bombed and a lot of people died uh even so a few days ago they showed a
a recall now during our president's visit
he was there and the people was protesting that why the current president did nothing to remember the victims of that sector
i think they were named  los de richos  de chinos the sector where practically all the town disappeared and i
right now i was making a call and suddenly and i did not think today is sunday i was half sleep more then awake and i oh my god
eh  del chorrillo exactly
aha but in that place you say almost happens the same in venezuela with the current president there are happening things that you know are happening to us
that happened long time ago then those things are put here in venezuela and happens idiot the other day i wrote to a reporter from
univision that donÂ´t be so shameless that donÂ´t put those things there that was not the reality the first thing people tell you eh and that president
and whatever he is a nuts what happens is that the information is being twisted and he is shown like a monster a dic
tator well a dictator and we have been through four elections and four referendum it is not possible more democracy but it is his personality he has a personality that
is uncommon and then people donÂ´t accept that and he is not a common person and people donÂ´t accept that then he is the first critical of all that stuff
and and ah well i donÂ´t know if you have heard him
of course of course look there is a page on the internet where you can watch television from all the countries including panama of course it is called
tv four all like tv four all
yes yes they get me off guard but do you have time participating here
four all
four is a number four
tv number four all
exactly exactly there you go
it is dot com yes
there you see the programming of all the channels all the chanels of the world and then of ocurse panama and venezuela and then now i now i see the venezuelan television
but specifically i watch the chanel from the government there because the other channels are from the opposition then of course it is a little bit more of the same
but i like to watch to see what horrific things they are saying
so i compare and since i have this internet page now i don't turn on the television now we are stuck with internet watching channels from
the whole world a bit like for comparing what is going on and even we are doing it with radio we're listening to community radio that you feel like you ar
wow it is almost ready me well just half almost to the tenth
are saying truly the truth or at least the other side of the coin let's not say it's the truth a hundred per cent because sometimes it's not
i mean it's like i don't know it's not that you can say that that everything the others say is not but
good heavens truly they manipulate it too much
i don't know if you
you gave yourself a i don't know if you watched a movie called auto fox
it's a documentary about those who work in fox news
and well the practically force them to say what it's not and then they decided to resign from the channel and besides resigning they all got together and the started to protest at a level
well at the level of of eh locally to tell the world what was going on inside fox news it's very interesting it's called something like
the fox workers that are out
something like out of outside
oh okay okay yes because casualy i received mail from them that they are accepting persons that can participate again in the beganing it was only one time you could participate
and fox from fox news
hi my name is fernanda
what what classification
but i think that the majority of tv there is let's say if you watch during the middle of the day that is when many times children are at home
are things that are not appropriate for most
and i think that uhm americans have no like the mo moral standards have gone down you understand so
many things already are like normal that that i think that they should not be
aha
hmjm
sure
ok
of course and
how are you
mmh
ah
what a horror
yes and that could happen let's say to any child who was watching television
and you can not either be on top of let's say if the kid changes you can not jump to see or whatever you have to trust that that let's say at least during the day
programming does not contain nudity or curse words or anything like that
yes
in mexico district mhm
i p yes i p look i'm colombian and i think that in colombia neithe
the tv is a lot better than here in that way
from washington
because they mig might show let's say at ten pm and the shows they put on are never so you don't you're not at risk Âright for them to be as bad as here here
even so here not even at ten neither at ten or at any other hour are you risking to watch anything else
ah yes
what horror
yes
yes imagine when let's say there are there are babysitters and things like that that you don't have control and you're not in the house to see
you don't know what they're watching that they go to their friends or whatever
i think
yes
hmm
washington dc
of course
no i
exactly
it doesn't matter to them hmm
sometimes and
yes yes yes
of course of course
yes he/she does not know how they are going to change
exactly
and that one becomes acostomed to it do you understand me we say
yes washington state
so that sometimes i see and like that one does not realize how they have changed things
and you where are you from
yes of course
yes i really don't know that much about movies because
let's say i don't have children or anything like that so i barely ever notice
my name is
has rude things and pornography and sometimes something stronger like a pg13 is more quiet
and doesn't have that many nude scenes or bad language personally i don't care about those ratings sometimes it just
don't know people who rate those movies don't know how to rate them or i don't know what are their point of view
aha
aha
aha
aha
yes
yes
yes yes it is true because uhm and it is true because uhm oe time well i don't have cable have the regular channels the ones one can watch
hi fernanda how are you my name is claudia
but for example i got to have one cable one time and sometimes it was well which ones do you like ten am eleven and well i i like to be changing the channel
to be well choosing the program i am going to see for that whi for that time
and sometimes they air movies that boy yes a ten or nine year old boy was at home and was watching the was changing it too at the same time that i and
stop on that channel there were things like very like very for adults already
then i said uf i said i thought about the children i said well i i am married i have been married three years and i have a a boy who is almost two years old
in any case my son is going to grow up and maybe this is going to get worse then
imagine then what kind of cartoons they are going to well i remember that once i was watching television look in mexico i am from mexico city
it was ten at night exactly ten at night then i turned on eh i had cable there and i learned the the cable to
to the channel that here is sixteen then there was a cartoon in english because at night they show some in english some in spanish
and there were cartoons in english then i told him and my mom was well well quiet because he was watching a cartoon channel
where are yo talking fine where are yo talking from
well well the cartoons started to show up naked
and the cartoon was starting to do things the two cartoon figures and it was a cartoon imagine and it was ten at night my mom told me
she turned the television off and well she had to explain a bit because well my mom she it didn't it surprised her because i had tuned to a cartoon channel a normal channel
then ok the truth not even cartoons are safe
sometimes cartoons yes
yes
yes yes it's true but really it's not the cartoons i'm sorry the japanese cartoons are are the ones that huh have more classification in mÃ©xico uh
uh tru in cablevisiÃ³n and multivisiÃ³n that would be what cable here to uh there in mÃ©xico it hasn't all those restrictions but for example in normal tv's with normal channels
yes it has like more more restrictions uh not so much now on the other cables and for example in in tv's for example normal of ch children's channel
of television like any channel the channel for example what is the five in cartoons
oh which one
for example well then at ten of clock eleven and you can watch tv and they don't put on programs so ugly like that well
before in mÃ©xico but for example if you're watching a cable channel now you risk the cartoon possibly being something sometimes some kind of
pornography thing or with more nudity
so uh right
right
right
yes that's true fi the other well uh i was with a neighbor and imagine i was with a neighbor it was twelve twelve and a half pm
and then her kid was watching uh the a cartoon channel and after that the girl wanted to change the channel and uh it was another channel that was also programmed for them for kids
well there has a program were it was were there was a a girl that showed the adventures of a girl and that was in a hospital
and suddenly it went right there in the hospital and they were showing how how her mom was having her little brother
oh because there are two of them right
aha but it showed and i went and told her her mom of hers and she told me ah there's no problem it's a channel of
of of cartoons of that they show a lot of programs and honestly it was it was it didn't it didn't leave much to the imagination i was really like the pose of well it was like an operation room where the woman was having her baby
they were they are six years old
because they're twins she is eh they both are six years old and their mom was letting them see that well each each parent allows to see what
what they want but honestly for m if i don't want to explain too much to my children in that moment well honestly i like keep watch more what
well what they see no in that aspect but uff
mm aha
yes no
yes it's one of those really those classifications that they have and n and n mainly for television they truth now now n
they don't leave anything to the mi to the imagination they show it right away
oh and the other one
now at any time of the day and you go and watch soap operas i don't like watching soap operas but you see
many mo moms are at home and they have little children three four years old five or more or they're at home and they watch they're watching their soap opera
and they're al always show scenes where they are the the couple they're there having relations
and in the middle of the day because the soap operas later are on from six in the morning until nightfall
and that's how they are so now they don't leave anything to the imagination
so the programs are classified to see a scene of pornography on the television at anytime of the day is normal and for many
parents unfortunately are making it normal
and i believe that that if the parents spoke to this television station and said that or demand that that were more strict programs to to privacies of scenes of this type of scenes
i believe that they would decrease a little but anyways not now or until parents if their children see something like that it's okay it's no problem
teaching and so these things of classifications i don't like and i believe it doesn't matter to the producers bei feel that to them its beneficial because
i'm talking from idaho i don't know if you know it
if a movie has some sex scene or has crudeness for the people they buy it or the people see it and they even sthey laugh
or sometimes it even calls their attention because it has a very strong scene so really these these things sometimes even help more
producers to sell
if that's the case no uh for me in particular the type of movies that i like in truth i really like disney movies the
children's movies i like them
even though i i am tired and i love all of this i have some disney movie around here sincerely i do not like the movies
strong so that that have many things of of sex and all that because equally i repeat to you that i am going to have more kids and while i am not going to be and
and at least that if they are going to put on a movie well that it is at least a decent movie that it does not have so many things
that is so that while we have those from disney at least they are going to be have pornography right then/well
no no yes then already this is the truth this is bringing the truth far as it already goes you turn on the television and if you you already see a commercial
yes well personally i don't believe that much about the movies ratings for my point of view the ratings don't go the way i suppose they would be
of feminine towels and it seems fine/well until almost almost they are goint to explain to you how while they are going to put a naked woman and they are going toyou
put there how she is placing the towel
because sometimes until they show it to you i don't know if you have seen the commercials that ugh likewise/equally it frightens you because you are big right but
but if a boy or a girl is seeing it for example and yoiu say if it is the mom and you can answer well fine and if it is the friend boy or girl
and you tell them and can explain to him/her the bad information then
then already yes
they don't know how to rate them for example sometimes they said that it is a pg movie but when you watch it and it really
good evening my name is mariza from philadelphia
in other way the the the christians is the most powerful religion in the world and there a more let's say that have power to have influence in politicians to the countries
mhm
hmm yeah
yeah
aham
really
oh oh no
oh i've heard that yes
exactly yeah there are a lot of problems yeah
no everyone can believe what they want what it is is that they try to impose their beliefs to everyone and for the bible for what they think
mariza mariza
yeah fundamentalism yes yes yes from the right wing but also the country is ah the party has the power so everyone from the president to everyone who is into this at the white house they're all rightwing republicans
target of uh christians and they are the ones that the people with power in the country the ones with the companies everyone is maybe there are a lot of rightwing republican fundamentalists who want to take the law away
the right to abort the right of for example another question was homosexuality gay marriage the right to the belief of
yes more scientific no no you can't just believe what they say they say god created man and woman you also have to give a choice for kids to believe
that was charles darwin who came up with the theory of evolution and
and it's really complicated too about the other question was about homosexuality yes yea if we were all equal or we all believed the same thing there wouldn't be any problems i was asking
but
yes
right for me i don't have any
mhm
oh chin maybe yes
yes i i'm convinced it's that because i know a lot of people that are
uh well homosexuals or lesbians and i'm really informed and so that's why yea i never know because ever since i was since i was a girl well
like i would accept people for i never thought they were better or worse for being homosexual and that everyone has the right to to well i don't know well to get married to
to be with whoever they want it's the same if it's a man or a woman to me it matters it doesn't matter to me and i think that we all have the same rights because we're all citizens and they pay the same taxes
they have to have the right to get married to live with whoever
mhm
right but the church won't see it that way
believe that it is an abomination because marriage is define as the union between a woman a man and believe and the people christian fundamentalist like i said before they see it as an abomination and they are so closed mind that they don't understand that
that was before the tradicional thinking but now times have change and each one also same as before homosexuality has been always since the beginning of man but before was a way and now is
i don't know thinks are more liberal let's say people isn't scare to talk like i am homosexual or i am gay or i am whatever
in san antonio yes
that is the problem the church has a problem but they can not do anything
people is accepting the echo from people yes like he is homosexual yes and well
right
yes
yes the religion has to be something personal no something that mix with politics each one can the think what you believe is each one doesn't have to be what
eh let's see why you don't think the same as me you are no me well like you get punish because we are diffent and shouldn't be that each person can think whatever they want believe in anything or anyone don't have
for the christians because they talk badly about the muslims because they say they are radicals or they talk badly about the atheist because they don't believein god and they call them heretic or
but i don't know
that is very christian you have to accept the people like they are and each and everyone one of them that believes or has your religion but that is the problem with the fundamentalists that they don't accept the differences
mm
yes that is a complicated and very controversial theme
what happens is that yes because in this country the kids when the families the christian families that righties say that they raise their children in a manner that when they are very little they teach them to be like that and that's how it is so
when they are older and know that people are different well they say no that is not right because they taught me like that and that is how they have to be
you know they are very radicals no they don't accept differences because they were raised in a manner that their parents taught them so
and for example i had the luck to travel a lot and meet people of different races cultures so i am very open to everything
and so when i see a person who is not and so i immediately know only by looking at them i say this person will not accept me because i'm not like them i am not i don't think the same i don't look the same
but is that there are classes there are mu people of different classes and well there has to be radicals christians there has to be everything but i think that yes religion does influence the country yes
yes
yes i am
of course yes yes yes
the message is very clear and it's already been five years in government and when bill clinton was in government he was not so he was more open let's say of course he was a leftist more ope a person more
mhm
that understood more people's concerns and this government let's say that they don't have the well that the the religious christians of the right that is the ones that are
saying how to do things in the country and that's why there is such a polemic with marriages also there is with the with the supreme court with with the judges that they want them to be from the right also and that they are religious well they
to be or catholic or that they are also they want that that they take away the right to abortion and things like that that is is ridiculous at this stage of the century
that like that they want that things go backwards that they go back instead of going forward they want that things become as they were thirty or forty years ago and that can not be
but that's how we are now
i in my family are from in spain i'm cat catholicism let's say it's as soon as you're born they baptize you first communion and all that so i got married in the church
i believe well i have my beliefs but i don't go to church to mass every sunday neither do i practice you know i don't practice i am i believe
but let's say that i carry it on my own let's say that i carry faith with me i don't
neither neither am i i mean i am very open i mean it's like contradictory that i am a believer i am catholic but no you know i am not funda nothing
yes yes yes there is much economic interest yes
yes
that is the problem it is that it goes right away that they are not interested on the followers they are interested on money and
and also they don't look like such believers either there have been many cases of of child abuse and things like that of child abuse
which you hear and you question and how can this be possible that a a priest do that to a child there is much polemic regarding that
but let's say faith it is each one i don't know that each person is free to believe what he wants and practice it but respecting others who are not the same
because there are many religions and what happens is that the christian religion is the most let's say abundant in the world it is the more the one that has the power on everything
yes but they don't have as much economic power that is the problem
ah yes really today in this country eh in the united states there is a lot lot of problems regarding religion it is a mix with politics and lot of right side people that want to have control
tried to control the country in base of religion also and it can be positive or it can be negative to many people it help to pray or believe help in others in others of others
hello hello mi name is juan you are marisol
then they exerted a power very very direct very sure trying to influence people there at the church
with the discourse it came to my attention against the public schools
directly against the public schools and praying for god to free us from public school some day
because yes
and against the theory about trying to see the theory of evolution no
no terrible they said why is this excruciating the teachers that teach the bible to explain the creation of the world
well i'm getting carried what i say is that reasonably the bible doesn't make for a explanation of the world
exactly they're fundamentalisms no
yes
well i think that maybe as similar as we are more problems no
i see mariza we talked a few days ago i think no
in that sense the differences help to complement each other
the subject the subject of homosexuality is very controversial
but at any given time it's not a like let's go like tolerance of the phenomenon of homosexuality has to be something like that that we're well informed about no i for example used to think that
it could have something to do with a deviation homosexuality but lately i've read that it's a matter of of genetics
no
well yes
yes
yes yes i agree with you exactly i think that they have all the rights because we can have any other type of person and in this cases the marriage rights are relatives
well many drive the homosexuality question as a very wicked situation and they don't have rights to marriage no really when marriage is really a contract
between two persons that stated doing something in comun
i could be i am in san antonio texas
no
aha
right yes like there is one that is so exreme eh the family and marrige the eclesiastic institution and the blessing of god for marriage and things when in reality
well the church and religion is a way of institution like school have
the need to change and find new ways to learn thing of life
from society and individuals no
right
yes well but in that case accepting the difference seems like something that has to do with the matter of humanity right
like one paradox not be able to accept the difference they think but right
yes
listen the theme for today is about religion no
right
eh yes influences a lot what fascinates me is that in this case
in this country being so fundamentalist right
with the churches there is a great proportion of fundamentalist even in the discourse of the president himself there are fundamentalists
not there
aha
aha and do you practice any religion in particular
sure
yes
yes the same with me and when sometimes i get closer with the catholic church it is almost temporary because they are they say listen where there is a feeling of integration of community there is
well exactly like the need of religion is something that we all have i think
created interests in everyone it seems
no then
yes
yes
aha
because in the world we have on this side of the world no because i believe that i only believe that not even the majority of christians i believe there are more muslims than christians
mmh
and this is like any other need the institution tried of
give us answer and ends been like a way to control no
yes let's see in this case for example here where i live i went to a church
that they express a project of ideology but regarding a conservative group in the united states no
hi good night
columbian
yes i have the truth is that hopefully technology continues moving ahead i say that here in about ten years what are they going to come up with no
because like this has to be moving forward no
mmh mmh
na sure yes
mhm of course
exactly yeah
yeah that's true ha
of course of course ha
of course that's true
yeah
oh but he speaks like a mexican
mm
true
mm mm
mm yeah
mm mm
it's true because of the cancer and how many years it has
and we did not find the cure right and he is right
a yes yes yes
mhm aids now that it is so widespread across many sites
well that's if
yes
yes yes
mm yeah
no no no it's not true
aha
yes
well well
i hope right i hope that comes out that that god may enlighten them so they can find something that could cure for this this catastrophe that is when cancer comes it does not matter the age but it comes right
it can happen to any person
yes yeah
oh my god in three days oh
oh okay sure
oh my god
oh yea
oh my god
mm
oh
mhm
mm mhm
oh that's good
yeah yes
yes right yeah
good night my name is carolina
yes so the tonight topic is the technical equipment

mhm
already
mhm
mhm already
yes
very slow yes
already clear
already safe
how about alex
mm mhm
mm yeah sure
well for me also of course and i work my jo i am an administrator and then eh my job i use and for me the computer that is
the most essential and above all eh and new techniques no new technologies that have come and every day more new things come up no
so the truth is that i have adapted very well and i love it since i've been using the computer because well before i used a type writer that was so slow to
write documents and forms and everything now everything is done through the computer and the internet no i mean it's something amazing
for me it's essential i think that i wouldn't know what to do without computers no so the truth is that i'm very happy with this new technology and i hope it keeps going
forward more every day no
that's true
aha yes and for everything no i mean it's all one
ah very good i'm from new york
want you find it there and well when one sits down in front of well i use it for my work but well also when i'm at home and i need
some information well i sit down in front of the computer and there's no stopping me i don't know when it's like with something an essential part of one's life no
for everything because if you need to know what the temperature is outside well you go to the computer
before it was yes mhm
yes yes yes
oh also yes oh
ok right and how many calls you made
oh and hm you are finished then
oh now now

ah well and good nice
through the internet i see aha
oh i see ehm yes oh no i never have speak with him i
oh yes

yeas yes i did and i think that they will start another one after they finish this one
mhm
oh so this is the second oh yes

right and they payed you too equal
oh ok ok
ah good
of course
mm yes
oh yeah right
yes
goo yes of course it is
i'm from peru
exactly yes
exactly
yeah
oh but here in
ofcourse but here in the united states
oh ya ofcourse yes yes justifiably i have just received ah from verizon that they are offering me free calls here in the united states
and they give me and in the meantime they charge me
yes ofcourse
ah how good it was
ya yes
and you
how great it would be no it would be excellent for calling the country when one wants i think it will be like that but with the cards also no every day
before it was pricey remember before for calling the country of
now it is very cheap of course
that ofcourse yes of course yes
now you can talk three four or five hours for five dollars
before it was one minute oh my god it was like eight
and yes i remember that i had to talk i think that just ten minutes was it cost me like twentyfive dollars
and i had to be careful a lot have the clock in front of me no
yes aha
aha of course ah yes
yes good night
mhm
because there's more demand
because technology has adavanced
what i would like to see is
more advanced technology with medicine
they have to find cures for things like cancer if you can go to the moon why cant they find a cure for cancer it could be they could make a
fast computer that can think why cant they find a cure for cancer
i want to see more advances in medicine i think their going slow in that area
i haven't really seen so many advances in diseases in the past 10203040 years
goo
yes it kills many people right
because here people speak mexican spanish
right that shortens the lives of many people
or or heart disease as well
aids is more advanced than cancer in in
in the sense of control because you have to have the drugs to fight it
but the cancer is very slow i think
you've heard of a discovery for cancer
i nothing nothing
very slow
that could be improved
yes
right
yes yes
i i had a friend that died very young at thirtytwo years of age and got cancer from one day to another
and she died in three days
yes because she got cerebral bleeding

in our lifes twentytwo this is my hm twentysecond call
i almost need about three but one call that the person spoke more in english i think is going to have a replacement
bu but who knows
because i spoke in spanish then they should consider
because if you speak in english they do not count it

on in english and another in spanish
yes and what we're doing right now is technology
because they are doing phone line connections
and this is technology yes something like that was the same thing but in english
yeah they paid the same
yes i like to do this not only for the payment but for the opportunity given to me
to speak in spanish
where are you from
because it is the t the only time in the day that i speak spanish
i i speak very little spanish now most of my day is english
yes
and what
this could not be done for about twenty thirty years what we are doing now
because they are using multiple telephone lines to connect many people living in different parts of the country
i think phone technology has made progress because i can also make long distance phone calls and i do not have to pay
ah a monthly fee
and you can make all the calls you want
and that wasn't that wasn't like that in five or ten twenty years
oh okay
here in the united states yes
yes
if they charge you something monthly but if you make a lot of calls it's worthwhile
and you know what some day they will make it international also for your favorite country
you pay a monthly quote and you can make the calls you want
yes
and it is cheaper right
and why is it cheap because of technology
yes technology
exactly
eh i am from the columbian residence
one minute was twenty cents yes
mm
yes yes yes that has happened to me too
that yes yes yes ah i know that yes what it is you have to be with the clock
yes but eh with with
what happens is that like it is advancing and technology is in the hands of of more people
then services are cheaper because they sell to more people
do you understand
eh for example the computer the computer a few years ago was worth one or two thousand dollars
now you can buy a computer for two hundred or three hundred dollars
