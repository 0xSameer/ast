now there are many divorces
mm
mmh aha
ah ok

ah ay she there she was with him there enduring everything good and bad
ah yes yes that is what happens yes well my mom my mom when when she became a widow because my dad no he died then she didn't she didn't remarry
she nev never remarried that is one of those oldfashioned moms no what did she say i will not m again i already put up with one i will not put up with another one
oh puerto rico that's okay
aha
yes aha
yes that is what happens then each one of us has a destiny
your karma like we call it in the vedic philosophy
aha do you know about karma
oh that is good
hmm
mhm
yes this is true no each one does a has a each action has a reaction and if one acts positively there are also positive reactions
or on the contrary negative actions and also it is a way to understand no yes
so
or if the suffering that someone experiences no it's all from relations with karma that one has mhm
mhm
okay
mhm
mhm
yes yes this is true
yes talk about anything and everything but we have to use the word marriage
hello good evening
oh okay
ah well v that's very good
no no
no i was married but not any more yes
well and have you been in atlanta many years
a same as me i have been here eleven years i arrived here in ninety four to go to university
ah ok
well it could be said that it could be said that you already are from atlanta then
more or less but do you return to to to peru once in a while
ah ok
oh well look at that i'm from
it's hard no
it gets difficult sometimes you get entangled in your own life and it is difficult to visit your own homeland
yes righti know what it is to go back yeah the flight back to puerto rico if it is for sale it is not so expensive you can get one
at least two hundred return
but if it is not for sale you are paying five or six hundred per person
yes about three hours from here flying
yes then i imagine it is much more expensive
do you have relatives over here
ah
well they said that we could talk about anything but you know
yes we are very close is this the first call you've made
if you wan na talk about marriage then we can talk about any marriage
i don't know mine lasted three years and it was honestly it was because i got married too you know n too young
and no there was us since you know we had ideas that weren't
compatibles the one with the other and the when we started the real life that
that we can say then we could not not keep the relationship
no
no
no and we could not __ you know we got a divorce but we remained fr friends een though there have been several years that i have not heard from him but we went you know
it was not something ugly neither we broke up like that with hatred or anything like that
and i always with the best for him but simply that we kn we made a a mistake i in regald to our age and our maturity when in
oh ok and i'm with my cellphone they called me three times but i was at the store so i couldnt pick up
did that
yes thank god
well that means that you met your husband here right
in atlanta
am but he i he is from peru also
ah ok and do you have children
ay how great
ah may god bless them
i hope one day but if not you know i am happy with my life
yes let's see a yes because i i said after that i said that the next time i am not going to get married until i know that
but where are you from
and it is not in my heart that it is not going to be forever
that it doesn't matters what comes i can endure it and i can last
so we'll see
yes that's the most important
to love him and have faith
i don't know how about your parents are they still in peru
ah ok
ah well mommy and daddy moved here after i moved
and then my my brother also followed me here and all now i have all my family here
yes mommy lives near the airport and daddy and mommy have i think they will be married for thirty five years this year in december
puerto rico
of being married yes
yes
yes they met when mom has two years on dad but they met when dad was fourteen and mom was sixteen
and they started dating almost immediately and since then until now they are together
so that is a positive marriage we can talk about
yes
yes what happened with well you know of course mom loves dad a lot and that has a lot to do with it but also what happens with my mother was that she
came from a poor family a sigle mom
and she never had anything that she could call you know hers
and then when she found my dad and he was the love of her life and she got married well then she had something her family it was
yeah yeah
you know her belongings
and she a lot because of that
yes exactly exactly
oh
no bec but they also say and maybe right for for one there is only another another soul
you know that there is for you another person
and after you have that person in your life if it if something happens and that person leaves well you know you don't have the need to look for anyone else because you were satisfied with that
yes
ex exactly your karma
oh yes
well yes they told me we could talk about marriage or talk about anything
oh yes it is very important to know about that because a lot of people don't want to take the responsibility for their actions and they think that no
they are not going to pay what they did
and that is not like this
exactly
exactly
and i have i believe in karma for my own
how do you say for my own spiritual ideals
but even though outside of believing in karma only scientifically as if it were an energy the energy does not leave it is not destroyed
for this reason if you create negative energy this negative energy has to leave from somewhere
y it is going to come back to you because you were the one who created it
oh ok well we use it right are you married
and from a well from a spiritual point of view which i see simply god made everyone to make the best of their lives but you are the one that is responsible for your actions
hello
he independence himself
ah he recently moved
ah yeah i know already eh everyone and they still miss him true
mhm
yeas yes i0m married
eight
ah look like my kids are still small one of them is seven years old and the other made three like two days ago
yes the time passes real quick and you're not even counting your age and the kids grow up
ah yes
aha
good night
yes
oh yes it is now
yes marriages now are very rare to really last
right now anything and trouble and they split just like that
many times don't
they don't try right they don't try don't try to improve things in their marriage
no he's american
oh yes mine is dark american
mine is dark american
oh no i'm the one with the clearer skin here
oh my name is norma from atlanta georgia
no my husband is black no but he is very kind
ah no is just that the americans are now very independent since they want to do no
ah
aha
ah of course is that suddenly no they don't don't
don't value much like before no now is different the whole mentality has changed towards marriage
ah
aha
aha
oh really how awful right
oh okay how are you
oh yes the husband is the wife is the one that controls
oh yes
is that since we like latina we are used to many ties is that a society more patriarch patriarchal more than anything
so then one maybe because the way one grow up right that for this reason one is more flexible
yeah
uh
of course maybe that is the reason why there are so many separations you know there are many divorces
marriages do not last one of two
of the factors
right
oh fine too well kind of fine here with my children
yeah because if you like a good latin woman sometimes you they're they're accustomed right to raise your voice
oh
oh yeah societies are different even if it doesn't seem right even if it doesn't seem like that at first but there a lot of differences really cultural differences right
right
oh you
right
sure yeah i also had a or i have a friend that married an american and he's like he says latin women are very different
yes really he appreciates a lot he says
no because he the latin girls are very different they don't cause too many problems
oh yes one is more faithful i suppose
oh okay
you can tell no that one is more faithful really
more more much more loyalty
mm
aha
yes is very sad no that now marriages don't last long and even more if they have kids the kids are the ones that suffer
yes
yeah
ah yes
ay poor children
mhm sure
yes i have two children
if the children suffer is enough they get traumatised when they are so small and have those problems no at home
they get very traunatised
mhm
sure
ay yes it is a real shame no that is why there is so many
many times the government take the children away from people like that when they are not well taken care of
no they are psychological mistreated or
of physical of physically
mhm
oh yes well
two kids also
oh yes they fight strong
yaah
oh they are big now they become teenagers
hello
yes he moved like 20 minutes away from here
the it's like aha down the hill already down then is
yes i miss him but sometimes he calls me or he comes here the weekends to eat or something
yes you are married
from how long
ah i have eighteen in like november
ah still yes from time to time i look at the photos of my son and i say my god how much time did really passed
yes yes the other day he was upset with me because he didn't go out and he a man thought that he was my boyfriend
because the people don't believe me when i tell my age
then him was braving that i wasn't his girlfriend she is my mom i see you with so small children you must be happy that he thinks that your mother is seen so young
good night my name is tami
then good bravo aya but lately what i realized is the people
here's really quick to get divorced
no one wants to work on their marriage
uh
uh
there's no patience
your hus is your husband latin
mine too
yeah you told me that how
mine is white i'm the brunette
oh i'm from washington washington the state
oh
ah yes yes my husband always tells me he says thank god because i'm from panama and he says thank god they sent me to panama and i met you
because the american women he tells me
i don't like them he says not so much the being independent is that they don't respect the marriage
he that's what he tells me no he doesn't say it because i'm i'm very independent but
i always take care of him
you know i don't give
no mm yes is is so different because my husband works with some guys
and they my husband's coworkers are americans no
and their wives give them like twenty dollars every two weeks for lunches the rest they stay with it they are americans is that it makes me laugh is that my husband has an xbox so they start playing here in the house no
oh really fine and you
and i laugh because they call my husband they seem as if they were teenagers can you play today and he says no my wife doesn't let me i laugh i tell him
and you your wife let's you do whatever you want the others that they have them that i laugh i say
working all day one hour to at least relax no
that way and that way i do laugh because also when it's because when they have lunch at my husband's work i tell them whenever you want to go just go i don't care
he tells me oh we could not go because the one could not go i said who didn't him and hes says his wife he he called him
oh completely
i say noway for us
mhm
yes that's it i i imagine one to be a bit more flexible and they like that and then that one they are calm they are more calm with you
but with these women i say those this one will leave
i was here painting my house
because they have him like that so tight that man will find a different place
mhm but i
don't understand
um no i tell my husband my my children are always laughing because we barely it's just that my husband and i we don't yell in the house and yeah if i'm calling him and uh
my voice is loud since i'm at the second floor of the house
my son says don't fight i tell him i'm not fighting i'm yelling
right exactly and my son i always tell me stop yelling do you want me to tell you when i'm yelling pal i'll show you
oh so
it's it's just very different
yeah it's it's so funny because my husband knows since i met him um he kinda didn't know how to dress very well
i was called i said okay oh godwell are you married
so i always i always put his clothes out
in the morning i say uh i don't care i put it out for him and they mess with him at work at work i say well
if he's the only one that looks good at work why do they mess with him
i mean all of those who go around with holes in their pants and women that you don't see anywhere and i say i don't mess with my husband and he dresses well what's with what's their problem with him
and he laughs but i don't care that he says i'm fine with my woman he says to me i say well uh no uh
mm
and yes is that
no and when we love we love hard
aha that's true
yes but here
so do i
mm
not here here they don't care i have a the friend of a best friend of my husband got married and in five years they were already divorced and it was like prostitute and that
other women and i don't know what and i would say oh my god and we are in the middle because i was friends with his wife and he's my husband's best friend
oh god i would say don't get me in the middle and i say that's bad don't ask me what she said because i'm not going to say
but like that
yes yes there's someone here my next door neighbor
ah she married a man and he already had a son about eight years
and they had two and this woman would get the boy the boy in the face
do not touch my children you are not my son and i do not know what and i say ay me i wished i could take this boy and bring to my home
because the way i would tell them off sometimes i would say the other day i told her you know what i am in my home and i do not want to hear your conversation about that you are doing your ex husband dirty and i do not know why you are talking so loud
yes i have two kids one has 19 years old and the other on 15 years old
and your children i say poor children that are listening to everything those bad things you say about their dad
and she says ay no
mhm
and she took her husband out her home and brought her boyfriend in
and i say oh my god if you gave it time for the man to get out and she already has another one
and that one as well how he screams at the children how he screams at the children
i say
mm yes this woman
it does not work
yes that is true the woman does not work the father bought the house and gives her money monthly
yes the older left home
but i would think listen if they give money monthly do something help other people of something not stuck in your house and and i believe that is why she is frustrated
because she does not do anything and with those little children that behave bad i say oh god i would have to yell at them also because they are by my side with that rock thrower and i don't know
oh oh and i with the husband we did not get along
i he came to to scream here in the house and i send him for my husband and they would look at me and tells me i have never seen you like that and i say well because latin women when you bother them and bother
when no more you reach the last and you listen well he laughs says i have never seen you like this and i say well then because i have had enough
hello
yes exactly exactly yes
then what more did he say let me see what else did he say we had to talk about music what what type of music do you like

but they didn't take me because i couldn't sing one needed to know how to sing and play an instrument
and i couldn't sing nor hold the instrument
now i am going to learn to take guitar
ah ay what what what a coincidence right
yes yes yes
um hu
um hu aha aha
um hu ya wai wait jeffi i´m taling this is business this is my baby he wants the charger for the games
yes the fourteen year old one yes
he thinks he thinks he is going to play now now he is going to sleep and you you have lots of music at home
ah ok
oh that´s nice i would like to learn to play piano i would like
aha aha
aha
it seems that we are the only hispanic girls or what
really you are a hare khrisna really
yes yes yes i knew it ok
aha
aha
yes yes yes aha
aha yes
yes and also music they use now they are making musi for math
i mean two plus two are four four plus four are eight and lots lots of math of
to learn to write to spell too there is a song that if you can write that word they teach you to sing it so you remember the lyrics
there are many things out there with music all is music because many children sometimes they don't learn more than talking my boy learned many things with music
ok
he learned the the the times tables with music i taught him like that you know
aha
right yes yes exatly
aha aha aha
ah you know i would tape the songs that i used to sing to him in english for my oldest son to my oldest son
my brother would then tape them in spanish
so one day he would listen to thema in spanish and then another day in english
i kept a record yes yes i had a book so we bought the book in spanish a history book in spanish it was really it was really by brother said put in in spanish too not just in english
because i would use to read lots of stories to him and when i was tired i would play a tape and he would play and listen to the story
he i didn't have to be reading the same story sixty thousand times
maybe maybe what music do i like i like merengue
because when you are young you have to read a lot
exactly exactly
exactly yes
yes yes that's true that's true yes anyway how many minutes do we have i'm a bit tired i had a tough day today oh my god
and at work i also pass time singing let me tell you
i pass because like the day goes faster when i singand and i do not let people that are fighting and arguing distub me
i am always singing yes the offinist tells me singer because to i am singing
i have to singyes yes yes
o yes yes yes that they speak lousy
lousy they talk lousy i do not knoe how the mothers i went to a party
i like the charismatic musi we are ah playing now in the catholic church
and the baby i believe she was three years ols and was playing that music i took it off
i said this is a children party i have my music always have my music how am i being the clown i will put this music on and when i put my music on the children started that is old folks music i do not want that
they wanted the music yes yes i told the mother how can you put that music that baby already saying fuy
and all the bad words that they said i said how horrible
yes yes yesyes
ye
aha
yes it is true the game those games
that are so violent my god
you know that the moms and the dads buy them to get the kids out of their of their sight
we are playing a lot of charismatic music that one of them who sings is young two oaks um miguel aquino to me well ah this it is like merengue but with with with jesus christ in in the music
but they are really bad because some of them are the whole day i have a nephew that gets in his room the whole day to listen to music and to play those games you barely see him
you barely see him and he is only fourteen years old
yes yes yes yes
aha aha
yes aha i feel pity for the children that are growing up now
yes yes yes yes and less social because
when you are on the computer or when you are listening to music
you don't become social you don't start to speak to people or anything
they don't want to see people
uh huh yes yes yes mine is the same he doesn't like to talk to people i tell him that he has to be social
how are you good evening
ah ok ah ok
yes we had to talk of music and i like music right music that they call salsa
right music that is hispanic right hispanic music after than the music we listen to in church too we call it quirta
right the stuff written in sanskrit is also very joyful
and i also like romantic music right ballads that well i don't think they call them ballads now
yes yes those types of music hmmm
ah hmmm
clearly you are you are what makes a countryman
ah ha clearly even your work requires it
clearly because if you are going to entertain children you have to move right
ah i am norma from here atlanta georgia
ah ha
sure of course if it is something is an active episode right
you want them if you want for example to teach them a lesson with humour then it is important that the children
feel that they are a part a part of the program
aha
um hu
so it is all good aha
um hu
sure so many times when music is used
it is like that and people remember better the things which happen
ah sure ah i don't know
no i above all the children and they are still being formed no they have more memories they have more memory so
something like stays more on their minds
aha
um hu
um hu
um hu
cl
sure music is part of culture each culture has their own music
and is identified with that mus that persons identify themselves each culture not with with a certain music for example hispanic culture it many it
don't identify it with salsa merengue not those fast dances that music there is
aha
there is no many people that like that um hu
ah that one the fourteen year old one
ah him yes i remember then
well yes i have music my husband he is the one that likes music the best more than me
no he really likes music he plays piano a little
yes and yes he he then we have lots of sacred music from our close church
what he is the one who learned to play harmonium and bridanga and cartalos
all those we are also teaching to my children
yes aha
yes that and the music is very important specially at the church
i don't know suddenly
no the music always gives a good message
for people no for people who remember then no i see that even when i watch tv programs
not that i see that christian people also have their music that they sing they show lots of emotion
and all with the music i mean music really influences a lot people's lives
um hu
yes um hu
um hu
um of course yes because now for example children when here in the abc in the alphabet
that song that is so famous abcd
just there my little kid has three years old too and he is there playing with this toys he has a train that we bought for him because it was his birthday a few days ago
suddenly all and the group is not very big
so he's there singing saying the abc so he would record it and he's taping the song
um hu
ah that's good aha
um hu
ah yes because when the children are little they are like sponges they learn a lot
no everything sticks to their minds it's the best time to teach them stuff
you have to teach them the best things nice habits
a
sureum hu
yes is good to cheer up the spirit
aha
well it depends i say also in music because there is some music that i do not like it is the one that they call now rap that young people use
i do not like that music it is terrible
yes a
um hu
oh my god they talk so much trash
sure they learn there the children speaking all that stuff they talk violence and all stuff
a matter like that very heavy like that for the children
just because of that now there are not that many that many children and theyget in so many problems the teenagers start to use arms and all of that consequence of all of that influence that they have
all of the
of all of that music of everything that the everything that they see on telelvision and all of the issue of violence
uhum
uhm hu oh those games too those games
yes
uhm hu
oh my god of course and the kids on top also that is why many times they get influences no the lack of activity teh children there is much childhood obesity
no that they are inactive they are infront of the computer using their games or with the television
no that is why there are people they are there is not the children
yes the children now are like more inactive
um hu
of course
um hu
ah what that is spiritual music with merengue
yes they isolate themselves
hello hello
it's pop music but it's not rock or anything so he plays the guitar and is a singer songwriter
yeah
oh
yeah

oh yeah
oh yeah
oh yeah oh
oh yeah
oh
i was born here
no yes
hello good evening you're speaking to mildred from connecticut
what country are you from
the meaning the things they had like moral values that that kind of left you a message
oh
dominican
aha
oh yes but you don't talk too dominican you speak more
hmm
i well ehm no i am puerto rican and i like salsa music a lot
i love to dance
and i find that music lets us be known the many countries at least in puerto rico there are many huge ehm songwriters and we have artists like
jennifer lopez marc anthony
oh yes aha we have talked
gilberto santa rosa that are known in many countries
oh i think that the music i love it i put in on when i am in the house i dance i clean much faster it cheers me it take away my depression
when i feel sad
or when i feel nostalgic about my country
so i listen the songs that sang that my mother used
and you do you like music
oh
mhm
yeah
so how old is your little girl
how are you is everything good
ok okay she is yes is a time for music
it's said that children that that are raised with music is from the womb are much relaxed and learn and are smarter
i don't know if it's true but
aha
yes no while the childrem whil the girls the best time
i think they get from the moment they are born until like the
four or five years or so
then they forget a lot of things
yes
ah
good thank you rather
oh that that's goo eh retarded children also leran a lot with the music
because my son had a partner who had eh had a little boy that with down's syndrome and
and she played music and he learned all the dances and everything really fast
he learned fast
and he memorized the songs
aha
aha
aha aha
yes she she exercises mmh
yes it helps her to learn to to know her body and at the same time it relaxes her too because the music is good
i think we discussed marriage
yeah yeah
i like that i go a lot to concerts when they have salsa concerts when they have
merengue concerts i don't i don't go a lot to merengue concerts well what i like the most i like a lot the typical music music of
how do you call it we would call it from inside the country
la plena la bomba all that and after that when in
new york they have presentations of of bomba and plena well we go there
and we go to olga tañon concerts
she she has a lot of nice music and also this boy who plays salsa this god what's his name victor manuel
i never miss their concerts we always go to see them
they have a lot of concerts here and we always go to see them
aha
yeah
yes because in your family is more
dominicans because i imagine that your family is more into dancing dominican music
oh really
yes
yes they left
oh and they stayed there
like a boy from the place of my girl they ask him what country are you from and he said i'm a mix salad they ask him why and he said because my dad is
my dad is from this country mi mother is from another one and my grandparents from another one i am like a mix and even i don't know who i am
uh huh uh huh
aha aha aha
i all the traditional music of my country i have shown my daughters
i have taught them the dances i have taught them the music and them but no they will not listen to it so much but they know how to dance it
and then here i belonged to the group for the puerto rican parade
and and we did dance performances and i was encharge of teaching the girls to dance to dance bomba to dance plena
to dance salsa
so the the my daughters know how to dance all that because the they like all the music
everyone likes the music
yes the traditional music is the most beautiful much more beautiful
i i also like the peruvian music that i find beautiful
the music of the chinese in india well i like it a lot their music is it's beautiful i don't understand what they're saying but
and
yes but the sound it has you know how it relaxes you
and now when i went to puerto rico i bought a cd of those who get music from the water
from from the trees from
ah when you want to relax when you're really tense well you put on this music and it sounds really nice
it sounds really beautiful
yeah
yes aha yeah no message or anything
and you come with what you have saved and you buy and
for this i say that the music is really important to well at least for me
my family and i were raised with music
today it's music
my kids my daughter is sixteen years old she like reggaeton music and he likes hiphop music
mi daughters are older and they listen to more american music
and
and i for exam the rock and roll i listen to it and i share with the boys but i can't tolerate t for too long
it gets to my nerves it kind of agitates me
so i don't like rock and roll much i listen to it and i have some young friends that have a a band
and sometimes i get invited to go see it and i watch it i stand and i hang with them for a while but later on i'm like oh no we're leaving we're leaving because my head is like crushed with
the those sounds in my ears
oh yes about the the reggaeton now
i believe that that music from before differs very much from nowadays the songwriters from before were like more dedicated to romantic stuff stuff like
hello
yes
uh um
i don't care much about that music what bothers me is the lyrics what they say
yes that i i like that kind of music but not what they say and that's why
uh um
yes
so well i was born in puerto rico but we moved to the united states when i was five or six years old but my parents are dominicans
so i am i feel that i am
no no i feel dominican and i don't feel puerto rican because i spent all of my summers in santo domingo with my family but the the my my ehm ah i forgot my godmother
that took care of me was puerto rican so you know i have from both of them
no but you know it depends on what depends on how it comes out
and you
hmm
hmm
hmm
i think i've already talked to you before this is annie from miami
yes
mhm mhm
yes
mhm
i like it i always listen to christian music
eh but also eh you know since i have a little girl i am trying to teach her we are going to teaching her different types of music so i always have it that she is listening
eh classic music or children's latin music
oh or in english you know the music that is teaching her colors or the alphabet or things like that and now is this time in my life i am more
you know with children's music
than lets say than music that i like most
but
bu she goes she is twenty monts
yes and
i don't know las night we went shopping and she was in the car eh singing the that alphabet song
you know my husband looked at me and said you don't know about her she is a little bit young for that i said to him i don't know but she is singing it
you know
yes
yes
well to me all
i always forgot a lot things too therefore that eh you know the music for us is something really really eh eh
you know important we don't watch much television
yes good and you
so all she let's say learn the animals or whatever is from the music and and the books we read
yes
aha
mmh mmh
yes
yes to she is like that eh many times they already start eh i don't remember who is what he sings but we have a disc that is call the song is called
my aunt or aunt monica or something like that
and that she liked dancing and when people see her dance they say ulala ulala you know
whatever it is and today about two or three weeks ago that he doesn't listen to that song and started the whole day ulala ulala and i was thining ok now the song is being remembered
you know but i like because i you see that that she moves her feet her knees her ca you know so
eh i don't remember what the topic that we were given last time was
we can also do the movements and she learns the parts of aha
the parts of of the body so you know everything though
and also the language because what we're doing is you know when my husband is not home i speak to her only in spanish
then when he comes home all the time well ninety percent of the time in english some times you know i keep using spanish because i'm used to it but
that way she can hear both languages and that's the other reason why we have so much music for her so she can hear it in english and spanish
yeah
la plena and things like that
hmm
hmm
hmm
that was that was that you have
hmm
well
mmm and for me i prefer merengue
istead of salsa
but
oh well it's the same because my parents lived in puerto rico i think like twenty something years before arriving to the united states so
you know we are not the typical family
because they lived in santo domingo so the revolution they had
the went to puerto rico and from there to miami
yes you know the spent a lot of time in puerto rico and that's because i don't really know what country i am from because i am like
five children wasn't it
a mix of you know both
yes that's how i feel many times i feel uncomfortable sometimes but you know i don't feel that much puerto rican
y don't fell that much dominican it depends
so but you know i i enjoy that of the two cultures and it's not that they're so different but you know they have they have some eh
words that that
mhm
yes
mhm
mhm that's beautiful
mhm
yes
i
and also the what to me the salsa you know this well or whatever but i think that of all the music i like traditional music
you know yes and as not yes no i don't know what i like more and i like to watch her dance more than when the people dance salsa or whatever
hmm
yes
ah
hmm oh how nice
hmm
yes this is good also we a lot of times we you know what happens even now before before this call we came back from shopping
not even five minutes and normally we turn on the radio and put on a you know a song that's average
yes
nothing more this music isn't anything more it doesn't have even a letter
and so this this also helps at least to relax me yo know relax or whatever
yes
mhm
mhm
aha
yes
yes
yes
yeah
hi um what is your name/
what do you think of cell phones do you have one
i don't have one right now when i was in europe i did have a telephone
but i don't have one here because it's very expensive
and i don't have i have little money because i'm a student
and i have decided not to have a cell phone but eh that's not the only reason also i have never liked mobile phones too much i'm not sure that they're healthy
because of the radiation that they emit haven't haven't they made any study
showing that they really not are not harmful
and i don't want to use a phone all my life and after twenty years they discover that it was bad for your health
and we all have brain cancer or something like that
sure and it's not known until later if it was good or not
pilar
okay that's a shame but
yes that too and it's also more dangerous
that's very dangerous there are many accidents now they are fewer because people are using that headset or or free hands i don't know they call it
but many people are still not using it and when you use one hand only i don't know how they can drive well
hmm
yes because it's also true sometimes in the in the
in the bus in the people talk loudly on their mobile
and that's is lack of education right
because there is no need to speak loudly you can speak more quietly right
yes yes well but i think that they were using satellite phones the cellphones work well but sometimes the didn't work and yes
nice to meet you where are you calling from
yes it worked sometimes but sometimes it didn't
but it's they do have their advantages one of them is that you can be contacted at all times
well that's if you have enough batteries yes if someone needs you or if they need to talk to you
they can reach you there and that's really good
and then well in the event of emergency
you can call i mean if your car breaks down in the freeway or if something happens to you you can call and ask for help
ask for help that's good that's why when i have a bit of money and when i'm able to pay for one i'm going to go buy a cellphone i will have to use it with the earphones
do they have that system here in the united states too
ah i'll look into that eh
of course
and where do you say where do you say you live
clear because also in the other contract you have to pay every month
and they almost always are plans in which included calls are very expensive
e europe i had a plan where you paid a basic service and you paid for calls but if you called little
sine it was much cheaper
of course
hm
of course
hm i believe that in europe it came before
the mobile phone and on there are countries i i i have lived in austria and there was the eighties more than 80 people had mobile
or is that the few had no mobile were small children or the or the older gentleman who already arrives too late and id not want user
in oh i don't know that
the whole world had mobile and and it was good i have been in the united states for some time then i left and i came back when i was that has been already three years four
no no one used mobile the people did not have mobile
and in europe everyone had mobile today it has made a comeback and everyone has mobile here well well it has arrived here too and i think that give or take it's the same
yes yes the people more than anything that talk loudly in the train in the bus and well there that's being uneducated but there are people that are on the street talking with
with a handset instead of using the telephone in the ear they have the telephone in their pocket and the handset is very small that you can't see it and they go talking and so they look as if they are talking to themselves and
yes and then you keep thinking that that person is crazy what's their problem
but i'm already already getting used to it if i see someone talking to themselves in the street i thin that they have a mobile telephone well good and another difference is that over there in europe the people use text messages a lot than over here i don't think that no one uses it
there are text messages that are short
that are written with the mobile and those turn out really cheap only and maybe only twentyfive cents for sending text messages well it's cheap in europe
here the calls are obviously much cheaper but i don't know but eh over there the best call will cost you for that twentyfie cents a minute
ah huh
and uh and the minimum is one minute and and the difference is that the text messages cost you twentyfive cents a message and when you call you almost always have to talk for more than a minute
then
of course
that doesn't matter of course
but there well there it was more popular between the students especially
because they have the fastest to write because writing with one telephone is complicated because it only has nine keys all which are in there
but the the students converted it in some kind of specie of of a game and of ability they even made competition about who could write the fastest
and they saved a lot of money sending messages instead instead of calling
and of course yes you call and you hang up without causing a lost connection
it is left there written whoever called you
hm mm
so the young gentleman use this to call to say to give out signs say when they call you that's what you call a miss call
when i give you a missed call the missed call calls me get down i'm waiting you down here or sometimes solely for display so that i can remember you
call and hang up and i remember you instead of sending an email or simply that is a message of
i agree with you that is many of the people of europe have a very good imagination when it comes to saving money
much growth much creativity
but i do
of course
but that is fine
hey but you should use a combination headphone with an earplug
that's the headset but it's going away because of the radiation
i am from spain and i live i live in new york
just in case
and what
sure sure
have you hear about the next generation telephones they are here
oh no i
yes i suppose but i mean the ones that you can watch tv
you can see web your email they have everything it's like a mini computer with web access it is supposed that some day it would happen they been working on this but they are not ready yet
they have it in europe and in australia since last year
i did not see it i never used it it was expensive but that would be great
uhm
no no from what i've seen of all of europe of all the us i have already spoken with good people we have to talk on cell phones no
sure they communicated with the machine
hello
ah yes yes yes yes yes
i do have a cell phone but the truth is that it's almost as if i didn't have it because n i hardly use it and i don't get many calls either
if if i use it it's eh very super very rarely that i use it and you
hm mm
yes
hm mm
yes ah why
hm mm
hm mm
hm yes
i am mercedes and you
like almost everything one starts using technology let's say like teflon they're doing the same right that maybe maybe
yes
and but let's say that you need to drive what would you think of the ineligible for example of those who drive and talk on the phone at the same time
and that's terrible indeed i agree with that
hm mm hm mm
for someo i think in my opinion it doesn't bother me hmm it's the people who have no respect in how they use their cellphone
that's true the thing is that they have no sense of courtesy in the way they use their
their cellphone
hm mm hm mm
exactly
ah nice to meet you
and and but i believe in my opinion more than anything is that people who don't respect who they're calling to the telephone and the people who drive but
well that's the con convenience that's there the telephone the cellphone it's a technology that facilitates communication in a lot of of
situations for example right now with the hurricane that's the only way many people could communicate with their families
yes that's right because we had a friend that was living in new orleans and we had tried to call him to his cellphone and the lines were down
the lines
it didn't work hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
hm mm hm mm
hm mm
mm i live in pero i'm from honduras originally
that's let's say they have prepaid plans really you have some in which you buy a card and you use the amount stated in the card
mm i i think they sell them in walmart
yes yes yes because they say they don't have any the problem is that you have to sign a contract right the contracts are never for plans of less than one or two years
and i have understood that with this card there is no need to sign a contract and one has a card and one buys what you will use it for
hm mm
if
of course eh yes that alone is the problem that i you we have right now the plan that i have as i say almost have cell phone but i hardly use
and by e at least have one that the the minutes will accumulate so much much less going them to deal with all
thus there is n possibility for us to use them
but well there is therefore will be cumulative and say in europe as it is the culture of the cell it is similar to the cu to here in the united states or
in
hm mm
hm mm
hm mmm
and so well there are the same problems that are here the people that do not respect where they used their cellphone
that has happened to me like i stay wondering as if they are talking to me or or to who
hm mm
hm hm mm
hm mm
i think in reality that that here is not common
eh in my country say yes it's a bit more common but i think that it's the same economy of people truth because like we say i know
mm it is to the west of the city of philadelphia
my country there isn't much money like there is here right here the people here it is twentyfive cents that is
exactly
hm mm
hmm mm hm mm i couldn't
hmm mm
hmm mm
okay
right
hm
imagination ah many do
past the following town is
lots of creativity that is the right word no i think i will have to practice to make a small difference but most don't use it
and that's the truth i have you but i only really want to use that for an emergency
someday i'll deflate the tire of the truck
uh huh i like to hear the truth
no
yes yes yes
yes yes
i have to buy one of those because it is dangerous the only one who i talk about my family with is my husband and he always
where is driving if you are driving hang up the telephone i do not want you to drive and talk
like almost never truth is very few times
and you
are they the ones that have your credit card information and everything else
no
oh
aha aha
oh
somebody who was in norway told me that you can do anything with your cell buy uhm buy food froma vending machine
you can pay the parking meter because they have your credit card information
ah no i thought that they were talking only were people in the philadelphia area
hello hello my name is auria
okay
um okay
is something like that with the exception that it almost never snows here but it starts getting real cold in mid january and lasts until march
then spring start but that doesn't last long it lasts like three or four weeks then boom its hot
exactly
yeah
i'm from puerto rico
yeah what about you
oh ok i was born here aswell i was born in north carolina i was raised there but then moved to puerto rico at the age of twelve
that's when i learned spanish
auria
i mean to speak spanish because i understood it i understood it because my parents talked to me in spanish but i always answered in english
because exactly also at twelve because i moved here when i almost had 13 years old
and i refused to talk any spanish i didn't want to know anything about puerto rico i was a real rebel so they took me out of
you know my school my friens
of course you now after a year of not having friends because nobody talked spanish i changed my mind
north carolina
yes
exactly
well it depends in the courtesy of the person who uses it
in my opinion there must be laws to regulate their use
nicole nice to meet
i just think that a person should have the courtesy to known that a cellphone should not me used in a movie or restaurant is should not be used
o at least excuse yourself and go out
exactly
yes
but even if it is an emergency you excuse yourself
i will return in five minutes you go outside you take the call and and
and yes but people like you say have no curtesy
the only law that i believe should exist to guide
because i have seen in front of me many accidents because the person in front of me is on the phone
they are in the highway and because they are talking miss their stop their exit they exit
fine fine and you
and then they do what i call a return to get to their exit and i have seen accidents because of this
at least wear ear buds or an earpiece like they say
if you're going to be in the car
yes
exactly
or because that's wasting the time you are with another person
exactly
i i am i agree with you because i thing that a lot of the technology even though it advances the communication like you said at the same time we as a society have the bad habit
to walk out of the moment
you know with the tv the videos and i don't know the music
i am a little north to atlanta
well you don't live in that moment and then the phone distracts you from the moment too i sometimes refuse to answer the phone
if i'm playing with my little girl she's four years old she will only have four years for one year you know
you know i will never be able to go back to that moment
so if the person is calling me i'll call them back later you know
exactly
exactly
exactly and one can't
yes that's true i think people as you say are addicted to it they always have to answer the phone whenever it rigns
and that's even when they don't even speak for a whole minute but they have to answer it whenever it rings
but not me i answer when i'm somewhere where i can really talk to that person but if i'm
oh hot but very beautiful and where are you from
i'm doing something cooking or reading a book to my daughter well i let it ring
and then i cal it back look ma'am sorry or look doe sorry
exactly
yeah i know
exactly
it's assumed so
no exactly but aha mom my mom is a teacher too and she goes through that a lot
she teaches spanish in high school too
oh esl
okay but my my daughter had bad luck with me because she's going to say that i'm old fashioned or whatever because she's not going to have a cell phone
ha from new york
at twelve or thirteen years old she's not going to be everywhere carrying a cell phone
oh yes but i i have seen kids that are about twelve thirteen you know are going to seventh eight grade and it seems that as they are already grown
they want to be older so they put a lot of pressure on their parents and the parents give them the cell phones
and i don't believe in that
when she is seventeen i will buy her a cell phone and that's it
and that is to call me
yes only i'm a single mother
and then she is the only one i have so far
yes the same with the playstations and that stuff i tell her no no
started to get cool or still
and when do autumn start and the cold comes
hello
eh in october start more like autumn feels more like autumn
the cold starts around in december january so like in january the snow starts then its cold until april so
there is still more to go
um
of course of course its the same here spring is really short here sometimes you don't even notice it
its cold then its hot
hey and where are you from
from puerto rico
i was born in new york but my family is cuban i also lived in chile for a while so my spanish is kind off messed up
mm
as is what is your name
yeah
of course so did i my parents always talked me in english but my grandparents i was raised with my grandparents we lived together
they always talked my in spanish and i answered in english so i started to really speak it when i was 14
of course at that age you feel
and where did you live before moving to puerto rico
where in north carolina
and because the topic i listened that was about cellphones i really don't know because they are separate topics but i have had conversations where someone listen one thing and the other one another
but i don't know what do you think about cellphones if they are annoying
mm
mm
auria hello i am nicole
of course
sure sure it is obvious the problem there are people that have no courtesy
i have been at the moies where the phone rings at a restaurant where the people are or two people in a restaurant and one is on the phone
or maybe if its an emergency obvious but i do not understand the emergency
there can not be so much emergency
sure
sure
um yes
um
um
nice to meet you how are you
um
um yeah yeah yeah i agree absolutely i mean driving
sure but having your hands free because you really need your hands free when you're driving i watch people
walking down the street not paying attention becuause they're talking over the phone driving it's a lot worse one should at leas have your hands
to drive and the other thing is at the hospitals that you really shouldn't use the phones on hospitals because the signals might interfere with the machines at the hospital
and one should have your phone off on other places i mean it's a matter of being considerate of others
and and to be eduacated with the people around you because if you are with friends or family when you answer the phone in the middle of a conversation it should be an important thing it shouldn't be
that you're talking to a friend talking with another friend over the phone you see
right right and the phone is something that's supposed to improve communication
but i thing that it makes communication worse if you're always interrupted with calls
fine where are you
right right
with the computers
um
sure
but i don't answer i mean if i'm with someone unless it's something important or if it's going to be a short call then we can agree something but if i'm with someone then i really never answer the phone
well i live on my own so i have lots of time when i'm alone to talk on the phone alone
and i i think that when you are with someone you should actually pay attention to that person kind of like it used to be when there were no cellphones and one would talk on the phone only at home not in the street
i mean i don't know it's a bit it's a bit of an addiction that people have to be connected all the time
i mean by email too i mean people have their blackberries and they are connected all the time they answer emails i don't really understand what can be so urgent that you send it by email
you can't answer it later when you are at home in front of your computer
oh yeah and how is it there how the climate
um
um ha
uhm uhm
of course of course that makes sense also now with cellphones you can see who's calling so if it's i don't know i mean if i'm going to see my friend tomorrow
and my friend is calling me well i'll answer it because i know we have to agree for the next day
but if it's someone else i'll call them later i mean i don't know i mean i think it's about having a little bit of common sense but people think that always other thing is that teenagers i'm a teacher teenagers
love the cellphones they always carry them there's always a cellphone ringing in class i mean i don't know how many times has a cellphone ringing in my class
and i say they're at school not for answering their phone but for learning
also they're there with all their friends i don't know who is calling i mean one imagine eh they're at high school but one imagine that most of the
teenagers in high school they're friends they're also at the same school
eh i am from new york
i mean because those phones are being ringed are the fathers ringing i don't think so
uhm and what does she teach your mom to
oh yes yes i teach english english for the immigrants
esl so
no twelve or thirteen no because some of my students already are like seventeen eighteen are grown enough
um um
yes yes
yes
ans do you have only one daughter
ok
yes i am in the city now
but well you are taking good care of her
no not cool don't know the climate until now it has been super humid but today been first day that is not as humid
good evening how are you i'm norma from here in atlanta
ah well no i don't agree that they should be driving and speaking that's very dangerous i don't know they could get distracted bring or they give them some bad news
i don't know they're in shock and there's there's going to be accidents because of that no
no but i mean somewhere else on the other hand cell phones have become necessary in case of emergency if something happens sometimes you can't find the phone
but you have your cell phone close by
and what do you think
yeah
yeah
yeah
sure
sure that shouldn't be i mean i agree if it's in case of emergency
we meet again right
and there's nothing but for example in school the children don't need cellphones
no they are going to study not to phone their friends to study
no and when you are driving well that's really dangerous that you know they drive and speak on the phone
yes it's like they say they don't pay attention no but it's also convenient right it has some advantages and disadvantages
sure
sure i mean parents are responsible as the saying goes education starts at home right
children or parents are not getting education they are not teaching their kids good manners
or do things that are appropriately
not even kids go they don't go to learn they don go to understand
mhm
aha
hmh
oh my god
ha
oh yeah
ha
oh yeah now people are that way
a lot of times they're addicted to the cellphone
oh if nothing happens they pick up their cellphone to see to look for someone to talk to
sure
of course like for certain i mean like for emergencies right
ah yes
really uh a lot of times you don't need it but many times there are things that you really don't you don't need for example there were no cellphones before cellphones that you
a few years back there were no cellphones there was no internet or something
you were living fine then you really didn't miss miss anything
no it's like if since we live in a consuming society well that's why
many times all the advertising all the marketing i don't know
they make us think that we really need something that yeah we really need it
uh um
oh on the train yeah
sure yeah really now everybody has a cellphone everybody goes around with their
cellphone talking talking from here to there
mhm
no
mh
ah yes
of course it's a child uh huh
ah of course
of course yes we when we go to the temple our temple also there
no there it's eh people have their cellphones and before starting the call there to prayer ah he tells them please turn off your cellphones so they don't interrupt
yes some turn it off no but some no still there the
they have and sometimes it sounds no
yes really
what did you say
hmmm
ah okay
ah yes
ah that could be true
yes in some things no that's good no
but too much addiction is too much
yes really
well every day well they call me i have not made calls
yes me too i know but i don't i
i don't do they call me every day because it's only there is a number of calls that you make
yes yes
no you can only make twenty five calls no more
i su suppose to i don't know ah because to me yes
they always call me every day since the beginning of the study
yes they call me every day
and one day and one day they made what do i know tow calls
well yesterday yesterday no yesterday a day on friday i lost a call because i wasn't they called and i wasn't in
here afterwards they didn't call again
mhm
aha
well
hellow my name is gloria
do you agree that people drive and speak
oh they call you every day oh that's good
oh that's good that's good
oh me too
aha
yes i lost i lost a few but i told them that i was here certain days ans sometimes i'm not in sometimes i am in
and the machine they leave a message in the machine they leave there i lost the call oh that they call again and sometimes they call again
because i tell them that i'm here late like until eleven so they call late many times they call late
yeah
yeah yeah
i don't like it i don't drive and talk on the phone i yell at people who drive and talk on the phone i go crazy
because they don't pay attention they're on the phone and they're not paying attention if they obeyed the traffic light or not or
or they're arguing once i was with my friend and her husband was arguing with her and i said hang up hang up on him you're going you're going to kill me because of that argument
and now kids sometimes use them at school we have to take them away cell phones at schools are a bother they lose them we have to look for them
we have to tag them they go crazy as if they're the last bill in the pocket and sometimes they don't respect they don't respect the teachers
teachers tell them to turn them off they don't do it and put them in vibration mode it's a bother a big bother especially at school
all those kids and they lose them we collect like 20 or 25 phones even after we tell them not to bring them to school
oh good and you
they still bring them
they still bring them
exactly
exactly
aha
exactly
yes sure that's right but yes you know i once told a mom you know you can't send the boy to school with a cellphone
ah but she was like that's how i can get in touch with him and i said he can use the office phone anytime he wants
yes like in an emergency you can call him and they go look for him
and she said no do you really think do you really think that i bought him the phone so that he would leave it on the boudoir and this and that and i said look
aha see last night i spoke to another lady lady that sounded like you but she was from philadelphia
so i'm going to tell the principal so that they remove the phone because one of the regulations of the school is that they can't bring cellphones
they can't bring them he's not you can't send him with one you are responsible for him getting scolded and they still don't talk to them they have to do it
that's wrong so that they won't do it again
eh yes yes yes
aha
ha
exactly yeah
lets see what else i am tired of weekend parties and i'm tired of being simply tired and let me tell you
let me tell you i had a party yesterday
and she told me she would get here later right cause she didn't find the place she called me like fifteen times
her name was silvia and we talked about the same we talked about the cell phone
in less than three minutes
and i let the cell phone ring i said i'm not going to let this women to cause me an accident
so that i can get to their party easily and i was close to their house and she said to go to the other place
yeah then two blocks later she said no its on the other side and then later i said i'm not going to listen to her
i'm going to go through the instructions i got from the internet
and then i got there easily i'm not gon na call her next time because she was driving me crazy with her cell phone
oh my god
yes yes yes
yeah yeah that's true that's true my husband my husband says to me oh always i will not buy you a new cellphone because you always leave it here
can you believe you have to carry it like it was your purse and i say i'm not going to carry it like my purse because
yes
i the my baby is the most important for me and he's at school and if something happens to him there they'll call me
and if something happens to you he calls me an ambulance why would i have a cellphone yeah we once saw an accident on the highway
you know so it's good then
yeah yeah yeah
i know right
right
yes
right
yeah yeah exactly and how they do it that's another thing
that every baby has to have that music about the noise and all that ¡oh my god and in the movies even in the movies he spoke about how we had to talk about
and do you remember about the cell phone
that if they use it in the movies in the movies they also start singing and they screw your movie when you go to the theater
now i'm not saying i go i'm tired of hearing everybody talking on their cellphones on the movie they on the train too on the train like it was
was their home
you hear you hear all the conversation all the conversation of the one next to you and the one in front of you
i don't like it i don't like it there either i put my cellphone in vibrate and whoever calls me has to wait for me to
get down from the train i'm a maniac my friends tell me aw gloria what's wrong with you and i say look you go to the highway
you're going at fifty and you're talking i don't think you can be aware of the conversation and the road i find it very odd because when i
i don't drive on the highway but when i drive i have to have my mind on the highway i can't be talking to someone
over the phone ¡oh my god it drives me crazy the phone that cellphone drives me crazy
i know
we need to talk about the cell phone
i know i know i didn't let my baby take it to school he has it for emergencies only
then he says to me mommy but if an emergency happens then i tell you you go and as i work in the school they leave you to call me
they now know that you are my son
they let you call me you know but the telephone we rule that everyone so that they don't bring the cellphones and still
they ignore it and you tell them not to use them and they're in the hallway they go to the bathroom
in the hallway they go behind the door oh horrible these horrible children nowadays oh my god horrible even in the church today in the church a poor lady
her cellphone rang as if it were a bell and even the priest when he was praying stopped and said what's that a door
and he made it like a joke
but and he made it like a joke then he said that when one comes to the church it's to pray not to for asking to play with the cellphone
so she felt bad and she went outside afterwards when she went outside and the cellphone started to ring again and everyone everyone started to laugh
about cell phones
because this lady was now i said ay that she's fenced in now interrupting the concentration that you have in the church you know so
uh huh
uh huh and the people still don't turn it off right
some turn it off
i know it's disrespectful right
it's like adults don't listen that's why children don't listen either
because they follow the roles of mom and dad you know i'm so tired now i'm i'm helping my son with his homework
we're writing having breakfast too he has to write eight sentences about cellphones why does he have a cellphone and can he live without a cellphone and can he use a cellphone at the movies
if he can use it when he goes dancing if this or that they also use it for games now i'm using the cell phone as a calculator
because i can use it as a calculator and the other oh it has a good thing i put my appointments in the cell phone
and do you like it
yes the only bad thing is that if i can't find my cellphone later i don't remember and i set a beep so it reminds me
i have an appointment today in that sense is good yes
yes i'm carrying it yes
i know
anyway keep talking because i'm tired oh my god have you called a lot has it been a lot of calls have you called or they always call you

internet can be helpful but also bad because like you said it has good and bad information right
pornography and all those things
yes
you have to be wisely but
but it's incredible communicate with someone or learning about anything
yes
like you just said encyclopedias you can access so many things
yes
that's true and now that i'm here i mean i wasn't used to cooking that much when i was younger
and now i go online and copy pastry recipes or whatever you just go online and get recipes
yes

i hope i was right if not well i passed this test so hey do you have many family at chile all your relatives
on the phone i've been very uhm positive i've been singed to i never thought it would be so fun
so interesting well just 3 or 4 people
but it's been an adventure really
mexico mexico city
and you
ah chile i like chilean pasties empanadas
sure
yes in mexico city when my husband was studying his master's degree
there was the the latin american academy of social sciences
paulina how's it going how are you
there were students from all latin america and well there was always an occasion for the chilean friend the argentinian friend to invite us to eat some of their foods
yes those empanadas i never forget
yes yes yes where are you talking
from georgia i´m in san antonio texas
how long do you live there
yes wow eleven years and two years
yes so in the begining starting the residence you get here to study
mmm
very good no
yes two years bearly because we were waiting my kids finished their middle learning
the same that i was going to question but i didn't listen well i think that it it wasn't very clearly and was highly intended for the internet
mmm in mexico they finished their secondary and now they are here in highschool
yes yes and this one and
i have two that are with me and a bigger one that is studying in the university she was going out of the house before
and has been studying two years in pennsylvania
yes she is studying engineer chemistry
yes and a lot of work how awful but of course is good there there it must stay what did you study
wow how cool that microbiology i like a lot a lot
yes yes yes yes yes i i studied social anthropology and also english teacher
mmm i was also a teacher in mexico
but yes definitely here the situation in the meaning of salaries and also is alot a lot better also i do have something of family here in
of it
in san antonio then well that's how they went
given things yes yes yes yes and do you have children already
oh
yes yes yes then you're not working at the moment
of course well and well enjoying
yes i am listening that's a good way to spend your time
so how many people have you met by this mean
yes the same has happened to me several times like two or three
that the call gets cut or it can't get through
yes and after that there's no one on the other side exactly
no no but but this does not remain clear this i attended
oh ha
yes this is interesting right i mean i didn't understand him
at first and now hes been talking he really is
whats the importance of talking right
because in this life with different things different careers nobody actually calls by phone anymore to say hi to a few friends right
so then one needs value that the important thing
yes yes yes yes yes
but to dedicate a few minutes cleaning things for example to call by phone is always like this is important
ha ha
yes
and i don't really listen and if it includes this it is rather difficult hard
yes
yes and well this about the internet is other question and well its marvelous
no but my chldren and specially the youngest it's always connected
and the most important is that computers are a marvelous thing right
they make information accessible
and well old printed encyclopedias become decoration objects
yes they are nice
bad information well we know things about
exactly scary thing right
yes
this and doing all of the points before you have to call bu the last advantage that was said was something about how many have been
yes or somebody in chile can send an email or something like that right
those parents too
yes yes yes you go online and search for a recipe a prescription or a natural remedy
microbiology physics even whatever you want no
yes aha
aha exactly and it's as easy as that right i remember when
the other day i wanted to cook some squash pie right for halloween
and i found like thirty five different recipes
well you can pick the one you like and cook it
yes and how was it
your most important dates in life and i intended and which i don't know are less important and while i say something on the internet that's your opinion
if not for this means that we have known the telephone calls and all
yeah well i have loved it for real it has resulted new is incredible
well like they are trying to stick on us that the telephone is useful and important no
to talk to people
my daughter in univesity of pennsylvania
yes you as well
yeah
ah okay
that was good hey talking about that
the other day i spoke to a man that lives in new york but his parents are puerto ricans
what are the advantages and disadvantages
that's difficult to understand ehh and i don't tell you that i have any problem as we speak and saying and they delete letters and change the wording
and they talk really fast what a job he told me and the same person that started the call no
no but simply
somebody must speak really good spanish
yes
yes
yes yes for example when you ask for holding in the line
how do people say i forgot ithold on
yes yes
it's fine to say those things i haven't said that just thought about it
good evening my name is i live in connecticut
ah
the conversation is about the internet do you use the internet
mm
aha aha
mm
yes is good i i like i use it also to look for jobs to look for information for my daughter for school but for
things of searching for people on the internet i don't like it
i don't believe in in in that i think you find there are many crazy people much too much of that garbage that they put on the internet and
then it turns out to be something that is not there's been a lot of people that have used it and and they've gotten married and everything but i i've never gotten into
in the chat rooms they talk about
oh miami oh and how are you
i've never talked to anybody
it was not true
aha aha aha
aha aha
and that i that that also has brought many problems to couples i find
because it has separated many couples where the husbands start at or the women they start on the internet and they meet people and they they spend hours there and hours and hours and lost hours on the on the internet site
i don't i use it there but my niece sends me pranks and she sends me jokes from puerto rico and and my son sends me the pictures of the baby the new baby that's why i like the services so much
because i can see my granddaughter all the time and and know who she is every month
aha aha
yes the picture is a it is it is something nice i love them but also eh what i don't like to much which you were saying you know that you send pictures and they save them like in a
good thanks and the baby sleeping
file it for a certain time then after that that i think after six or something like that it it does apparently delete them the the
the program looks like it erases it if you don't remove it
ah then whenever i don't i do retouch them then i leave them in the computer and i place them on a cd
and i place the date and we put it on a i create a label then that's how i have them if one of my family member comes we get them on the television and the computer
fine fine yes why em if you leave them on the computer that will will use up your megabytes i think
fine
uhm
fine
fine yeah
yes
you will have a break at least
yes you can do it you can but you have to i think you have to program the cd to be able to watch it on the tv so you need to buy a cable i think that most cameras have one and
and you and you you have to connect it to the television that's what we do every time we have a party we put it on
the cd then when our family comes over we gather around the television in the living room and we watch it from there it looks say better
because the screen is bigger too you put the music on
well it it looks nicer that's why i like the internet but for all the other couple stuff i don't like that
no but you see all these kids that are taken away it's like they meet crazy people in the internet
that happened to a girl from around here a guy was courting her he was not from new jersey he was around forty years old and the girl was around fifteen
and he took her luckily they caught him on time but god knows what would've happened had he taken her and killed her and i don't like kids to use it only sometimes
it's a small room that we use as an office
hmm hmm
oh good
yeah
yes when you are around they change the screen what can you do sometimes i tell my grandchildren what are you doing no nothing nothing
and i open the other screen what do you have there let's see
you have to watch them closely because the computer is a little it has a lot of advantages but also disadvantages
because look all that information it provides for these these terrorists to learn to make bombs even those students those that killed all that people in columbine school
they got their ideas from the internet so sometimes i mean it has a good side like everything like everything they make it has good points and then it has other points that
they're disastrous
yeah yeah
yes now well there are many things for parental control and all that stuff
that at least one well with that can control them a little more than before but at the beginning that there had been none of that well you know that the little children get into in the chat rooms eh they open twenty thousand things
good watching watching a program on tv that i like to watch on wednesday
mhm
ah it's it's people that eh when s i think that if you leave the the password and don't close the when you are going to read the mail
if you don't close well the fast lo or let's suppose you you are going to cook or do something and you leave it there an open space
many there are many men that many people that know how to grab your to grab your password of that moment that you are there left for for for a long time for that it tells you that so quickly
you are going to leave the computer well you grab and you close it do you understand me to assure that nobody grabs your information well then they what they do that now when they grab your password they come and they start to send
d those emails that that sometimes what they carry are viruses sometimes that which they carry are filth
so everything depends on that is at least you have to have a lot of carefulness with the with the passwords and with the information especially that of the bank and all that
when sometimes they send you to ask information that you that they tell you put in your pin again because
there one has to be careful
uh huh
oh i have allergies but besides that well i have taken vitamins so it can go away
ah yes well that is the he stole the identity well that is being used a lot now in
through the internet they steal the the the whole identity that's why when you know sometimes they tell you to take what do i know something for free they offer you twenty things for free on the internet and you go ahead and start filling it out and then
when they start asking your information of your your mother's maiden name birth date and all those things well it's not good to give that information
oh
no
hello
but
anyway i
i use it that's like my i use it every day there we eh you know we have email we have eh eh we do everything we need to do with the bank
i search for information recipes i go to the library
i don't buy much but if we are going to buy something i always do like eh research
eh searching for the products to see where i find the best price so the internet for us is is is like you know having an
encyclopedia let's say
at home
no me neither
well i
this is annie in miami we spoke before
yes eh and
i before eh i got in in chat rooms but they were not to to you know to find people i mean they were about different topics
but no it was nothing eh you know after a while i didn't like it because people like that you i don't now like they said things that
that l
yes or or normally they don't say you know like the got ugly
and i didn't like it at all so after a while like one or two months i stopped going but because i prefer to talk to people no you know
being there in in in front of a machine
but you know i have a
yes
yes it is something that we also do we take pictures of the girl and we send them to all our friends the friends and all the well not every month any more but earlier it used to be every month
good and you
and and i like that a lot because that way at least people we know the family who is far from us they can see how she is growing
yes that is it that is something we do a lot i had forgotten about the pictures
well our little girl has close to 2 years with us and this has never ever come up the pictures are there it all depends you know
on what you are using but we still have pictures in the internet of of long ago of my baby shower
ah very pret pretty fine
ah how good that's a good idea
well i always make copies before placing them into the the the computer
oh excuse me in the internet i always make copies and place them on a cd and all of that
then so i have the originals which cu took we take a hundred plus hundreds each month
but i only place let's say thirty or forty on the internet then i kekeep the originals and place them on the internet because the ones on the internet are the ones that are already
that's good yes thanks to god
you know touched up you know thethe best so i always have two tow kinds of cds so if she if she wants the pictures when she grows up i can look out for her look these are the best and these are are the originals whatever you'd like
in that way she has them but
i had never thought about putting it in the television
yes
mhm eh eh yes that's a great idea
yes
me neither that's as you said you know you never know who you are going to meet
yes
neither do i that's i mean i don't know anymore you know my kid he's when he's older he will use the computer and
i will have to change it to another room because we currently have it in one it's kind of an office let's call it that that's how we are calling it
yes just a few minutes ago she felt asleep
and
yes but i want to place it let's say in the living room or you know somewhere where i could watch them while they are using it so that i can see them
and see what they are doing because i used to be a teacher i know you know all the things that children do
how they hide from the parents and stuff like that and i don't
don't want to imply that my dau
yes it's
so
ah
yes
it all depends on how you use it you know yes i i i love internet but i also know when to
and how are you
you know if you begin to if you begin but when children begin to use it it has to be a little different
you know because i think sometimes they don't
yes
well and and still that that happens even though they have the parental controls because many times when i go to to look for my email you know i know that this happened to to some of my students that they are going to open the email
and photos are turning up of you know naked women whatever
and and that is something that that bothers me a lot that i don't know how it is that can be changed you know
yes
yes
no thank god we you know things like that on the computer no that hasn't happened to us but someone yes was stolen the the number of of
social security
oh that's good i am getting a cold i have very bad pain in my throat
of my husband a few years ago and we had a many problems
because
that is what you say but since i am pregnant i cant take a lot of
for this reason i am you know i am not feeling too well
hi good night eh i'm nicole speaking from new york
about telemarketing i don't like i don't know who likes that
that people calls them to sell whatever uh i don't know
uh no i think they're talking about when they call you
that when they call you on the phone and they sell you stuff and also when
when they send you emails
they sell right spam
so i don't know i don't know if that's convincing to anyone i have never bought anything or looked at an email like that seriously
and i don't know
yeah uh i've bought things over the internet but not
right
hi how are you
right right well it should be cash
it must be someone that sees those emails and is convinced because if not
um
sure
mhm sure
i don't know if if you have tried using those lists that say not to call
i mean there is like you can register on a list and with that they're not supposed to call your number or they stop calling you but i don't know
i am registered anyways they call me sometimes
but not so much not so much as before
um yes well i always say ah no like that like that i can't can't speak now i can't speak now and i hang up so i don't i don't really want to hear the story that they're going to tell me because i know that i won't
fine fine we talked before or not
i won't buy
mm
yes yes yes also
yes
yes it must be a terrible job to have that job my sister did it for about a week
and she arrived every day at home crying because everybody
sure no nobody wants to listen i mean
i mean everybody hangs up on you and she use to come back so upset that she stopped working there after a week
no also they pressure you when you have a job like that they pressure you ah
ah to make sales i mean the are like like listening to you while you make the call the bosses are listening in
no no i spoke with someone from atlanta
to see how you're selling and if you're not
sure it is very effective very effective they throw you or pay you less that is a bad job sometimes i feel a little bad for the persons
sure sure like how like they also are trying to make money but i do not want to give them my money that is the problem
em don't know what is is that i answer surveys ose yes yes they call me with surveys that is i want to know
that if i will vote and for whom what do i think about the political situation today that i do answer in the surveys
i believe that is good eh to have one or i mean a diversity of opinions
and i like to contribute to something because it is for investigations or for
sure but but they are not asking me for money only answers opinions silver no eh
sure sure also i do not want what they are selling me the news i don't want or sea now o sea i read the news in the internet
and i do not want newspaper in my house
but i don't know
eh and i do not know what else they sell me life insurance i do not want
mhm that you won a car
that you just have to go to miami to look for it
right
right no the majority of those things
they're all just to make money because if it weren't for that they wouldn't be winning
someone has to pay those peoples' salaries
mm right that's the other thing that sometimes
they call and say they hav they leave you a message and tell you that you have to call some number to get your prize
and it turns out the number is one that if you call it you get charged
from what country are you
i mean it's like those nine hundred numbers a nine hundred that they charge you money for calling so
mm
i think it's cheap i mean i believe it's cheap for the company to do this kind of publicity i mean surely they pay a little
to the people that are calling
in fact sometimes the people that is calling us is not even here in the united states
but they have like communication systems
that allows people to call you from india
and one doesn't notice how they speak english in india
i mean how they do it like outsourcing
how do they pay the people in those countries to call you to sell you things can you imagine
ah ok eh
the few that that people is getting paid
they are making the phone calls so if they do one or two sales per person they are making money that is why they do it because they can't
i mean they must not sell much like that but since they pay little to the employees they must earn a little because of that
sure it's a poor country
um i heard once that when you call a help desk when you have a problem with your computer you call a help number and many times the people answering those calls are in india
mhm
sure and sometimes the reception is pretty bad
clearly or sometimes there's a delay so you can't hear
anyway that's really bad i mean i'm calling the phone company and their communication system is awful that's unbelievable
it's inconceivable and also with the time zones there must be like a twelve hour difference with india
me well my family is cuban
sure or work night shifts
i'm quite sure people calls them during the day more often than during the nights so it must be night for them they are working night shifts
i mean if it's three o'clock here
well it might be worth it for those people maybe it's better that those other works
sure it's a little hard to talk a lot about this subject sometimes the given topics are
there is not much to say
yes
schedule that because it was translated from english
is a machine that is translating from english to spanish
to schedule i also i was also listening to schedule what was it about schedule
eh but i was born here in the united states
and then i thought in english date must mean dating to schedule
how how careless or rather a language study
is is supposed to be a linguistics study
and the words can't be translated to spanish
hello good night
ah ok and so you think about nol
yes
no it's it's referring to it's referring to telemarketing that thing that looks like popups on the internet or that they call you on the phone
oh when they call you over the phone
oh
oh spam yeah
right
right
oh me neither i don't think that that i've bought things over the internet i haven't bought things over the internet online
not what they send you in spam
ay i'm norma from here in atlanta georgia
no no other things you really need no
no and
yes sure surely there are people that invest in that not for themselves like that per eh they worry about sending all those emails and the
and the small companies or who knows who does that then they invest money doing that
sure no and that by phone yes by phone yes really it's bothersome specially when you're busy
aha bothersome
aha
yes for sure
mhm yes sure no sometimes no and people sometimes that sell are very insistant
aha
fine and you
sure that you're not interested
yes sometimes there are people and sometimes there are what you call them scams that they call them that they sell something and sometimes at the end it's not true those things also happen
fraudulent things that they offer
the offer to sell by phone even by internet too
ah yes yes many families there that worked
nobody wanted to buy
yes without even listening
sure really it's a job that's very it's not very no not very rewarding that we can say it's more the bitterness
sure
yes
um i don't know
they pay by commission for sure
yes sometimes we thing well it is a job that they do like any other job no
mhm mhm
yeah
mhm
sure
mm like research
sure because today we never really know who it is no really who is lying
yes
insurance vacations
uh yes
yes that that's really
yea or that you won this much but they have to send a certain amount of money to assure your prize
a matter
mhm
right
yes you really have to be quite careful and not
no
yes
mm
ah and plus everyone has to pay long distance yea really you have to be pretty careful aside from that no but paying a lot of people because they want more business
mhm
not that a way of publicity that they say
yes
o yes yes that is true
mhm
o yes fair
yes of the accent they have
yes
um
of course because in india they don't pay much that is why
sure because in india it's a different way of life you have to pay there they pay very little wages to the people
i'm i'm peruvian
aha so these people are anxious for work to get any job they don't
yes that's true even here in the big for example the telecommunications company here in the south bell south
no every time my husband calls or every time i call because there is a problem with our telephone with the internet so you call and the people that answer the phone are in india
no yes mhm sure and you can't even understand what they are saying because they don't speak
mhm mhm
sure now yes
so i guess most of those people work full time no
or work yes night shifts
yes kind of mhm
of course let's see what else we can say to complete the 12 minutes
and you
mhm
of course since last time someone called because of the appointments
that it called schedule
yes is a
is a question is not a question i said what is schedule i did not understand very well
yes
yes instead of dating
oh yeah
of course
of course of course that is that is best not even the complete translation or the appropriate
uh

ah you have
ah you are not married are you
ah aha
ah ok
ah he is there right in
ah see i am forty one
i'm fine and you we spoke yesterday right
mm
doesn't appear the right person
mm
mm
mm
yes you are still young
yes well when you get married is different is
no and you have like more obligations
is not the same freedom as before specially if you have kids
mm
ah okay ah yes yes
sure that's true but on standstill or have you already decided
no next to a bit more of her or deprive themselves of a bit more of their liberty i suppose that it must be that way no
yes
mhm
mm
oh that's very true you're very right there
when the the kids are small are babies and hmm no one doesn't have time even for eat ever for eating or even to shower
aha
ah yes a little baby
sure little babies are like that exactly mhm
yes yes i think we spoke about it
i don't know if it's true that when kids are little babies you have to be with them all the time
ah my kids one is 7 and the other 3
yes they are still little too
they are little kids no and
mhm
clearly clearly enjoy enjoy while you can and
clearly because if not one there of
yes yes he is american he is dark haired american
i married he is also he doesn't live in the temple anymore
he is of the same religion as then there we met
aha
ah i am of the hare krishna movement
i don't know if you have heard
mm
mm yes yes we are vegetarians there's no
oh yes yes there are many temples in peru in around the world there are many temples
oh yes of course
and they are vegetarians since the womb
no no there is the
up to now no so when they are little no they are little and they still don't teach them to be vegetarians
if not they don't ask or have any inclination when they are adolescents already when they start to to i don't know to ask nobody can force them to to do something they don't want to do no and is a matter of them
aha
they have they are not kids they have free will when they get older and
no they have to choose or see for themselves
were you huh
hmm
oh
yeah
aham
when you have a meal
hmm
sure it's like more healthy right
yes that's what i was thinking
it is more healthy and even its more digestive
mhm
no no we do not eat meat eggs or fish
no and you are still with the same boyfriend
ah ok now all of a sudden the other the other boyfriend is there suggest him all of a sudden he is not inclined to eat meat and you make him a vegetarian you have it easier your a vegetarian
mhm
aham
aham
aham
aham
sure i don't think nobody agrees with sales through television
well some people feel leaning well it is like a habit they were born and grew like that right
grew up eating meat and don't know that there is another alternative suddenly hear something but never imagined how is it like right
to be a vegetarian really has nothing to nothing to envy to people who eat meat i have been a vegetarian for about twenty years
no and and really one feels very well it is very healthy right you don't even show your real age
if you are a vegetarian
no but it is different aha
sure it is very heavy for the digestion human body is not adapted right to eat meat it is not carnivore
yes because when you start been a vegetarian you don't know how to balance your eating
sure so you also have to find proteins to eat
and find that you don't eat with meat
hello
no eh you are peruvian
mm
mm
sure and milk and yogurt and that everything
yes i see
sure sure you get used to it
sure i like it and since i really really like indian food and they have a lot of vegetarian stuff
i like asian food in general
chinese food japanese food well i like that one i like fish
but eh what else were you going to ask i had another question but i forgot do your kids speak spanish and english or
sure sure because with your husband you speak speak in english
ah ok and how much how long are you living here
hmm
hmm
ten years and do you have family here or
aha
ah ok
and did you come as a young girl or as an adult
mm ok ok and what you do in atlanta
mhm
ah ok
how well
hello good afternoon it's me nicole from new york
ok
how many childre are they
two boys what a thing
ah yeah
yes yes i imagine i i was grew up with my sister i mean two girls so
i don´t know how they are
no no yet
i live i live by myself close to my parents
mm
i am 27 years old
hello how are you
yes not for me i mean i would like a lot to have a family get married and have a family but
i don't know until now no
no the same i don't know my boyfriend the same i mean we get along well perhaps
but we've been together a year i mean we met a year ago
therefore we are waiting a little
but perhaps yes i hope that yes
yes same with him
sure
sure
sure sure no i like to live alone sometimes is a little lonely i like to go out do things
no not yesterday because i didn't get any calls yesterday but i think we've spoken before
see other people because if not is like too lonely but i don't know everything at the right time i believe
sure
sure because because it's too much work and when you have a family it's already too much work
and i i like being on my own like that i say i i like i like the peacefulness i like to think and to read
i think that when when i have kids
hmm then it will be very difficult to do those things
so that
sure sure i went to visit a friend that has a daughter
the daughter is like like six weeks old
i mean very little and i don't know my friend with the with the baby always i mean she doesn't leave her
but i can't recall the subject maybe it's about the same subject sales through television
i mean she's with her at every moment but she she is very happy but it's an enormous responsibility until they grow up a bit
mm and how old are your kids
ah yes
clearly clearly this
how beautiful to have to have kids o to have family is like i believe that that is the best of life
i don't know in a few more years i will leave th peace i am going to leave the peace
clearly
and your your husband you met him here in the us
ah yes
ah
yes we did i think it was last friday
yes what religion is it
oh look yes
yes i studied in the in the university i studied buddhism that
is like the same it has similar things doesn't it
and in peru there's also hari krishna there must be
mm and the are the kids vegetarians also or no
there is
and they never ask to eat meat
no
of course
we spoke of that subject it's stupid
of course mm
sure sure
yes i was a vegetarian for a while
been a vegetarian for ten years but then i went to chile and i was living with a boyfriend there and it was hard to keep being a vegetarian be
cause he ate steak and i prepared vegetarian stuff
and he put like a a piece of steak in the middle i kind of didn't want to eat like that
so i stopped i stopped there because it was too complicated and then i came back and kept on it but i'm not eating much steak i eat
very v i never cook steak at home just
exactly if i eat outside or i go to someone else's house and they prepare something then sure but at home only vegetables and i don't know legume
i like it hmm i prefer to eat like this
what else are we to say
i mean
hmm
mm yes truth is that no i do not like meat very much i like fish
i don't know you eat fish or not
no fish no but meat per se no it do not like it much
no no we split up
yes i have never had a relationship with someone who is a vegetarian never
and and i have had like five boyfriends
something like serious boyfriends
so to speak more or less serious
well let's speak about something else because what else have we left to say we are not having the same conversation as before
but all of them eat meat and they were like they liked meat even the actual one too
he likes hamburguers and chicken
mm sure
mm
mm
sure
if not to me i prefer because
meat makes me feel like very full like very heavy
mm but the people who are accustomed to eat meat they feel like hungry if they do not eat meat
mm sure you have to worry about having proteins
hi how are you aham we want to talk about what i didn't perfectly get the
aham because i'm on a list of i don't know if you know there's a list that you can put your name on
with the government and they cant call if i still believe there's this list and i don't know where
they can send but they cant call me
this start is how the one 2 1/2 like the government uses this list because they were complaining
there are many called of rest and some hour's day i hope to put my number in this list do u understand
it isn't for requesting but for don't pay my count if they call me
if i don't pay my account they go to call me for go to post office and make many things
i don't know if you have computer but if you have they would go to send many things
haha
mm
aha no because the phone we need to get another phone because the phone i have the volume i can't i have to uh turn the volume up
where are you from did u said how long a time do u live in usa
a year wow where do you come from ah you're from spain yes because i'm from latin america hispanic
yes but in panama it's very commercial in panama a very small country you know what i mean
yes yes but panama is a lot more developed than costa rica yes there's a lot of
oh yes eh
yes yes well puerto rica is the most democratic country in the american continent yes
they don't have an army and their whole politics in costa rica is the most the most peaceful of all
i'm telling you the truth a map there near the united states there they have a different party and every party one year you're in the government or two or three years in government and then comes another party and they do great
no army and no nothing of that that the government has to use force you know what i mean
ah but many people don't know but in panama we have more business are more developed
yeah i can hear you but i couldn't hear what the machine was saying
because of the panama canal there are people from all over the world there in panama there are people from all over the world there are many people who go there
working with boats with big boats like they say'junk ship left with the boat' right and if they wanted to stay they would stay in panama
and they don't go back to their countries so thre is actually a lot of people that cant get out when they're working in the ship
when they come to panama you know what they say leave the boat and they mix themselves with the people from panama
like three million people yeah the whole country
yeah its a small country but its good with business
yes very small only three thousand peses three thousand people oh wait not three thousand three million sorry
no three thousand three thousand no no that's right because i had a friend in new york and she was in the library doing business
a business library and i found the yellow pages from spain the yellow pages is the book with the phone numbers in it
yellow right yellow from spain wasn't as big as the one from brooklyn and brookyln is a small part of the united states in the city of mexico there's only five boroughs right
yeah yeah well speaks spanish with a yankee accent you see
brooklyn was on of the borough an the entire spanish page wasnt
yes yes about thirty years but but if i have more than thirty years here if if i have a lot of years here and i'm more american than latin
very good also it all depends on the person and
the education and also the people with whom you are all the time understand it because if you have gone to college or something like that you still keep talking in a certain way understand because i'm going to tell you the truth
oh i have a teacher a teacher here from right i went to a brooklyn college she was the a teacher of a spanish teacher who teaches spanish
but her class was spanish literature get it like don quijote lazarillo de torme and all that
and i don't remember lazarillo de torme the first the first kinky novel
the thing is that she is the worst teacher i have ever had in my whole life and she learned spanish from a book not speaking in her house
like the machine the machine that you heard but she speaks better than the machine see but she knew spanish very well since she had to study a lot of spain of when the moors where involved and all that
she had to visit some like it is said in new york we have a right museum
well the situation also in spansish there are a lot of words and ah not only the words but of
where a lot of spanish architecture is tought they see the influences that the moors have had in the influence of spain and we have several words like the word maybe ojalá is arab yes
yes because when they tell you things i wish that we would go to the movies tomorrow and that's the movie right
i hope but i'm telling you i hope that allah the god he understand but that's a different thing speaking about those telemarketing and spam you say you don't get lots of that
no no email right oh please oh believe me i get a lot because i use yahoo which one do you have
oh please
and it's not just horrible but that people how do you say it in english right i'm saying it i'm telling you they practically are they are pretty creative
they know how to write stuff that you are going to want to read
so they say things that you are probably going to read and make you look inside and i tell you they are really how can i say it
imagination yes they are imaginative
aha
from different countries different regions they say some things differently you see because i'm here here in new york and i was talking to
ohhh oh millions oh oh no oh
ah no oh and look they have accumulated much in the past six months
it has risen sharply previous says that i won something in england and i have to go to england to claim my doólares pesos or what they have and that oh so dejate
but they say yes yes
but see they send they send a lot of that other country and sent two thousand right two million
and hope that one or two people you understand me
other incredible eh say a i say that if the lord has like fifty thousand dollars if you do not answer
fifty thousand fifty million and did not tell and i who are crazy and many countries are saying and many say they are from nigeria nigeria eh eh
aha
oh
puerto ricans and they call oranges
and the thing but eh i do not think the government could as you can you can not know who is sending the person who is what you are doing that
itself and also the thing that when they send all those letters if eh it's hard when it says it's good you know what they're trying to get yours chabas understand the money but
chinese yeah i can't take that because a chinese is someone who comes from china
a woman but that's coloquial so that's not their spanish isn't it but the thing is that okay we were talking about telemarketing right
hi fine fine i'm laya
aha ahhhhh
okay so i cant send to you publicity how you wish
they cant call okay haha
not a spanish word
and for the called that don't function
of course if you are well they wouldn't call you
ahaha ahaha
well it makes one year i live in usa so i still believe there is many localities the enterprises of marketing call for telephone in the true i don't receive many called those someone see me something or no
and for email is something but it s too much for email already is a matter i have many accounts what it isn't good
of university is privacy and each day was removed 50000 emails of publicity
oh yeah we have to talk about spam about unsolicited comercial advertising about telemarketing about yeah sometimes they call home to sell you stuff or they send mails of they send emails that kind of stuff
here it s chronological water if soften if treat and that's good everything
i've a year on my own yes yes i'm from spain from barcelona
yes yes yes then ah from panama very good very good
yes i was in costa rica last year i was relatively close to panama i was in costa rica last year
yes no because well i thought costa rica is a pretty good country
you didn't see poverty on the streets and i don't know
hmm hmm and they don't have an army right
hmmmjajaja hmm yes yes
yeah yeah
yeah yeah that's great yes
you can't hear me
ah sure sure hm
mja
haha of course ha
haha haha look
yeah whats the population in panama in the whole country
four three that's it wow thats small very small
wow that's small haha
oh oh oh oh oh oh ok ok ok ok three thousand is smaller than my small town three million is small aswell i knew it was three million
ok ok ok ok ok
yeah yeah yeah the yellow pages yeah yeah yeah yeah mmm
yeah also because the machine speaks spanish badly
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but there is a lot of people
mja mja and you have been here for a lot of years
yes no no one can notice by the accent when you speak english when you speak english i mean
mja mja of course mja mja mja
mja mja
mja mja
oh yes i do remember from when i went to the institute
mja mja mja

mja
yeah aside from the accent well a lot i don't know a lot of things that really you can't understand but yeah
mja oh yes which museum is this yes

i don't get lots of calls or papers but i do get a lot of emails emails yes i get lots of emails
well i have several i have hotmail gmail i have the one from my american college the one from my university in spain i mean
i spend my day looking at many different emails it sucks yes yes
how how how aha yes

yes they have imagination no they are creative
and i get one once a week i get one in french
expressions yes yes yes aham yes yes yes
that says it says that an old widow of an african dictator has died and has left i don't know how many millions
and he is asking for help to make those millions and that he and as well
yes yes yes yes
oh yes yes i also asked if anyone really believe these stories it is not
because i know it seems incredible that someone could bite is as if someone sent someone not sting
yes of course
yes today does not cost any effort to send an email to millions of people and i do not know whether it seems to me incredible that someone could bite
yes yes some history some amazing stories
yes of nigeria and also as i am in college organize conferences
then there are people who register for the conference and then ask you some good money to come complicated stories that sometimes people do not know if it's true or a lie or the internet with it
aham chinese
sometimes do not know is you're talking to someone for real or are you completely kidding it's
ah yes it is tricky because it's so easy to hide your identity no

yeah
yeah
yeah
hello
ah look what part of new york
um
in what part of new york
to in
yes
yes
i don't like it
and you uh
yes me neither me neither i think that it is always an annoyance i mean more than anything
yes it must be i mean they mast make money with that because otherwise they wouldn't do it
i mean
hello
um
how
um
no no there must be people who sometimes i think that people are alone like maybe older people if they are alone and
and like they they like talking
they could like start to talk plus sometimes older people like that like they are more confused like they can
they can convince them a little more
but i believe that the majority of young people now i don't know i don't know there must be also young people who can be convinced but i believe that people are very busy they don't want to waste their time in
in having a conversation like that
ah i mean they are in my email all the spam goes to a different folder
eh i'm nicole from new york
the email does that like automatically
yes like that i don't even see it i don't even open that folder like it is always there and and it is the place by itself eliminates it after thirty days or something like that
almost never sometimes yes sometimes i go and watch but already because they arrive in the hundred or for example there should be about two hundred fifty and no so i get bored watching it
um yes
perhaps in the spam
clearly
yes
how nice how nice what service do you use
what email do you use
yes good i never open the spam emails but i look through the list in order to see if someone if another person has called but no
and you nicole
i don't open them because i believe that
um yes
yes that is they say sure i do not know if that really happens i think we have to open the email also the attachment like one
one archive we need to open also something they send together with email
because yes do not not believe that can send a virus by simply sending an email
ya yes better
um
yes yes
yes they sell and also o be like pornographic things
do not know pills
nicole
hu
uh
well there must be people i don't know i think there are people i mean that let themselves be fooled by those things like they let themselves
i don't know i know a woman that that yes there are some emails that talk about about someone i don't know how they are like emails that say that someone from the government
needs help and that that if one puts money in eh they'll give you the money back plus i don't know ten times more something like that and i do know a woman
that yes i mean and that she always believes it and that she isn't so good it's as if she's a bit a bit crazy or something but she always believes it
she always believes it and she has lost a pile of money
yes yes it is true that that that is i mean selling things as such i think that a lot of people don't buy it but they tell you
that one's going to win money i mean yes that one that that one sends money and they'll send you much more i think that there are people who dream about that
like that
nicole nicole no no it's not a spanish name
sure sure sure but there are always people who think so
they are the only ones in the world who are going to win with that i mean there are people that like want to dream about that
it's li like gambling i mean there are people who gamble and they think they're going to win a lot of money even though everyone loses money with that
sure sure but there's always people who will gamble and think that they will become rich
and so so with betting some few of course win money there must be a someone but few
of course
of sourse or the poker also a little bit or not
yes the poker i think you have like
the poker it's like psychological because you have to pretend that you has more than you really have or less than you have i don't know
is like a whole game of
what's your name
of course um
of course no no this is like
of course
ja look
ha
look
but i think its good that people can win because people loose money their should be some that should win
um
yeah i subscribed
its the same thing sometimes they call me but a lot less less than before and they take time to start working it takes a few months
pilar and where where are you from
and then one can see it they tell you and tell you we will put you on the list and the list starts in three or four months
but then you find out there's a lot less calls
but there's always somebody that calls i don't know
um
um
um
of course
yes i think not all the companies like
they take attention to the list or not all have the list i don't know who have that list
maybe is less i don't know if you put your name there but your number there
ah look eh and where are you right now
but they call you anyway
um
oh sounds good
um
um
um um
sure sure
sure
sure
um sure
hello
yes um
ah in what part of madrid eh oh in manhattan
but well we have to talk we are deviating and they are not going to pay us the topic today is telemarketing no
and what do you think
when they call you on the phone to try and sell you something
not at all of course
i don't know anyone who who who likes it in fact i don't know anyone who has ever bought anything via via telephone
but let's go i believe that someone must buy from them because otherwise
yes of course but they must make very little because i
i have never heard anyone who is not bothered by it i even think it causes more damage
hello what's your name
because it is like negative publicity for them
because if they are calling people to their home and they are bothering them
well the people are not giving a god opinion basically no
yes well yes
they can convince you to sell them something
yes unfortunately
of course of course and and spam too
of course
and it it is less bothersome then no
and no you never check to see
what what's your name
i yes i look through it every time that i enter i look at the spam mail because sometimes something passes through there that isn't spam
he has gone to the spam folder but most people do not look through and what has happened to me is that i write something to someone
and they don't reply no reply
and it was because it had gone to the spam folder and not because they had seen it before deleting it understand
i look at them but rarely and almost always it's okay it's almost always just spam in the spam folder
and no spam arrives in my inbox
excuse me
i have various accounts i have yahoo and hotmail i've got various ones y yes it's good because the spam is very protected and a virus can not enter
no but yes but including sometimes you can get email from people that you know but they are still viruses
and that also does not allow you to open them it's good
or or
the what
yes
no the yes um have to download all the archives but that is what you can not do hotmail it soes not let you download the archive
because the truth is that it has many tricks the email those of virus and many times looks like yes yes one person that you know that is sending something that interests you
and is is a virus o is that have to be very careful and the the ones that send commercials through the internet or the the people that are sending spam they are really selling things
me is because i do not understand that who buys from them
yes is mostly all the time
yes all the illegal stuff they sell that is fothat is way
eh pills that are not approved that dipromise miracles and people believe it is that i do not understand
who believes that
nico nico i don't understand but it isn't spanish no
yes sure
i do bite
well it's very dangerous that is very dangerous because there are a lot of people who have lost a lot of money that way
yes that is that is there are people who bite
that is already a lack of of intelligence that's already a lack of i mean of really thinking because they're going to give me free money and how is it that i alone got it from all the people in the world with email and
yes
sure
yes practically if not the bank if not the casino wouldn't exist
yes
the ones who go to have fun for a day the ones who go because they don't have an addiction and the ones who are dedicated professionally to play because there are some games i think there is a game it's the black jack
i'm pilar
in which you have the probabilities if you play god of make money
i don't know
i think it's going but i suppose that
well in the poker i know i saw a documentary with the people of the mit that they have their tricks to count cards which is ilegal of course the casino it´s too clever for one thing that you can do for beat the casino they prohibited it
and it's no a cheating really a cheat could be have mark in the cards
cards under the sleeve but if you're capable of counting cards why is that going to be cheating so they were from casino to casino so they were not to be caught
winning a little bit in each one not winning too much in each casino to not attrac attention but they were caught and they were forbiden the entrance to the casinos
and they had to go to europe to win in the european casinos
i was just curious
but but if nobody
pil pilar
that true nobody justs gives away money people want too believe it
its its rare that somebody would give you something they always look for something in return and you've put your number
and does it work
good
the bad thing about the list is that is not obligatory it should be so you can put your number on the list so they cant call you
but i don't know simply its a list for companies that dont want to bother on calling other people
that say they don't want them to call because its wa waste of money and time
if there are other companies don't mind for them and they try it just in case y all the possible ways
are those that do not look at the lists and they call you and make you waste your time
and they lose money
from spain
hu
i know if
i don't like anyone but i'm lucky my telephone was new
in january i put my telephone on the list and the phone i have received were of the companies when i have one service
they want to sell me more services
that's also very annoying
but next time they call me they call me of the same bank
they have called me a few times about the same thing next time i'm going to tell them to please put me in their bank's list
of no calling
i mean they must have a list like that because you're one of their clients i mean
in new york
if one of their clients tells them not to call anymore they would be dumb to keep on calling because the client can get mad and leave
so i'm going to try it to see if those annoying people from the bank stop calling because besides is that they always want to sell me the same thing and i've told them no because they want to sell it to me again
they think one day i'm going to say yes because they insist a lot is that i don't understand them
hello
yes
there are still i think the same some i like others no so that and here all the time i get in the mail today i got three
again for about refinancing my house i say no those people don't let it go
yes
yes hat is that is true too true
mhm i always check them
yes because mm well there are some as i one says one can find something good if you look but on the phone i don't like that
yes
and sometimes they call me very early that supposedly they can't call until after eight o'clock they call me before eight but i don't answer
yes i'm set
this is tammy
yes i've got the caller id set up depending if i don't know who it is then i hope that the answering machine picks up if i know the voice then i pick up
sometimes yes sometimes if i get the phone and say ah i already know who it is and say no thank you no thanks oh sometimes i pretend like i don't speak english
so they leave me alone i don't speak english
in english
no they haven't called me in spanish only in english
yes not here here they haven't started yes well that's what i have to say
no there are many here
you have to see because here there are many there are many mexicans here
no there's a lot there's panamanians but i don't know many and
no no nobody has called me that i know other people i don't know but they haven't called me
alex again how are you
oh yes
i got into my into email today and i had ninetyseven
uh huh
if it's true
too much it's that too much of the stuff they send you one doesn't even ask for it my husband was laughing yesterday because he got a letter from a telemarketing about some nude beaches of nudes and i was laughing
angrier he says where where they i'm from and i was laughing
had it was funny because he had all the letters in his hand but that one they sent him that if you see it from the outside i don't know it doesn't say what it is
he had it in the in the jacket so that no one saw it i say who's going to see it who's going to start seeing your stuff i was laughing
you why do they always send that i say i don't know i don't know
uh huh
i thing not so many people makes this survey
ah
that's good uh huh
but we have to be careful when someone is involved
mhm
ha
hay mhm
i remember when i went to see my lawyer i said a girl crying in the office the secretary was crying and i said why are you crying and she responded no that
one of those telemarketing things have taken five hundred dollars from my account
first one hundred fifty dollars then the lawyer that she was working for told her he was going to help her
no people don't think about that
because i have talked to you like three of four times
when i buy things off of the internet me and my husband have a special card we put on money on it when we buy things on the internet
so if we are going to spend sixty dollars that's all i put on it so yeah
what
exactly me too
i heard about the news they arrested some government people in a city of africa
they were mm
ok
yes i
yes i don't mess with those people they have even call me to canada they try to make me buy their products
lottery tickets
and somebody else two or three
in canada i believe what for i didn't buy lottery tickets over here i don´t want to participate in the canadian lottery
no they say you would be rich i say no thanks
yeah that's right my son's girlfriend received a card that mentioned she had won pair of earrings
made out of diamond a watch and money she was supposed to send two hundred dollars in order to get her prize
and she tells me because she only has eighteen years old i tell her do not get involved like a mad woman to be bossing around anything
hmm
yes
hmm
aha yes
yes
it's not our fault that there wasn't enough people in this survey
yes because any person there are persons that are like that that it is easy for them to get involved in things like that when they say that there is something that is free i tell you when it is free
hmm my husband always tells me when it is something like that he reads everything the small print on the bottom read it well well because they can come out with something that you have to pay something
so it is difficult after you signed to come out with something like that
hmm so there has to i always tell that to my sister and my children
you read everything i don't have get anything in spanish yet
i tell you with me the people don't even think that i am latina when they come to see me so i do that too so if you now have that
you can call to take off the marketing of you're phone that's good too
but i don't know i probably can ask to my husband he knows because it says that is free you put your phone number and your name and they get you out of
the list that they have because there are some people that you tell and they keep calling
because
it's funny
because they buy the names the names list
and sometimes they go like once they said to me they go for each number one two three four five they don't know the my phone number but
they go exactly almost one two three four five numbers like that they mark directly
so its that easy for them for not lose anything why they are doing it in order
mmm
i almost made this earlier but i couldn't so i said i was calling later but i forgot it and then
hello
i always call at 9 o'clock and it is 9 o'clock
okay what do you think about telemarketing
sometimes there are good offers
i like the marketing more by mail because it's not so ah how do i tell you it's more private and one can look at the offer without the pressure of the
of the call
and sometimes sa good deals come out and i don't put in everything that i receive
i i i look at the things sometimes
well everything in life is a risk i no no i think that there are many things that are a risk everything is a risk sometimes you're going to win and other times you're going to lose true
the problem is when it's bothering you at an inopportune time or when they are taking advantage of a person
yes really it's not important to me that usually i don't answer the calls
yes
yes i know that it's telemarketing
yes
and they they call you in english or spanish
never in spanish
and because here here since there are so many hispanic people in los angeles sometimes they call in spanish
well i think that you are the only person that speaks spanish in seattle
according to the fisher survey
yes
but they don't do marketing in spanish
and the other thing that bothers me sometimes there's too much marketing spam on the computer
alex
there's a lot of that that should be more controlled by the law
because sometimes i have a special email to filter
and sometimes i have a thousand emails there only telemarketing
and i have to throw them away i have that you take ten or fifteen minutes to throw them away when i could be doing something more important
yes wow
that is incredible
but sometimes good things come up about a year ago it came up for a thing to see a show here nearby
and i won a ticket to las vegas and some tickets to disneyland
and i didn't spend anything
there are there are times when good things come up from marketing
fine
yes we have to be careful specially because of the computer and because of internet banking sometimes its a scam
i have a friend that got scammed while marketing using a credit card
and they took his money from the the bank because he gave it away
and they charged him like 200 dollars just to apply for the credit card
yeah why
this actually happenes a lot you should never do that never give it out your information to a telemarketing agency
because its actually a legal robbery
and something else that has been
uh um i have received cards that have to be send to the united states of america
and they want their bank account to do their transaction i believe this is a trick so that way you don´t get anything they are going to take away all the money you have in the bank
no i don't think so
yes it gets out of africa
and i am from great britain i researched a company that made me an offer to work for them and they would pay me a lot of money
it came to be a fake company
they wanted to clear my bank account
mhm
yes
yes they always say that
yes
and and also many times it has happened to me that i have won things on the compute
but i have to do the survey and in the survy survey i have to buy something
well we are going to get paid
and i already know that it is a scam because one gives one's name one's address and one's phone number
and then they want more they want one to buy something
then i never do it and i have never received anything to me i have never received anything it is like a marketing
there should be laws against that cheat
free or or that you have won something
that is what is called in spanish i think a hook
and there is much of that happen in spain too
you are going to receive it in these days
yes that would be good
i think that they are going to keep calling because they do the calls spontaneosly so they are not but how they know your name too if they are doing it spontaneously
yes
how are they going to know your name
mmm
yes
then i think we are agree the best marketing goes out from the mail
or newspapers
yes it's the same
i'm always here at this time
good evening mildred of connecticut
well look i vote for my party but sometimes when i like a candidate from another party vote for too
not me as they say i am not a fan of in truth not because they say then pure be pure idealist that game but
when i see that a candidate is going to do something good for my community or for the state then i do vote for him even if he is from another
and i vote for all other candidates that that my party has but no i mean no i don't try to how do you say it
aha aha
yes but i believe that they are little more more conservative regarding some aspects but in other things well sometimes they go overboard
yeah because of that i believe that it is like no no they don't stay long in in power because they let themselves like like like they get scared after they get into things like they
they get scared and they go back or they stay
but the fact of being conservative indicates that that you now they stay on the margin of certain things they don't want to pass because they follow too much the
the matters of ethics and matters of of of politics you know they follow too much i think that the concepts democrats well what they see that they go to
how are you
still still that people are on them well they immediately go you know they do it even though the whole world is on top of them saying no that they don't want what they are
placing but really well i don't know in my in my country at least democrats this have they had control for like for twentyeight years
and after those twentyeight years that the leader died who was the strong leader of that party well then it has been you know some years they vote democratic
others the next four years they vote republican and they come back again the democrats and they come back and place republicans depending it depends on them of of of how they see the country's situation if they see that the country in those four years they didn't do anything well they take the person out quickly
right right
yes i think to but yeah a candidate uh if a if a party has a good candidate and and like because look this man who ruled over puerto rico it was luis muños marin
he ruled for twenty eight years he did a lot of good things you know he brought a lot of progress to the country he brought things that well when the country was late well he moved it forward
so well he he maintained control so of all people and after he he died many of the generations that stayed i mean they still
even though he was dead they still followed his ideals they didn't follow really uh they didn't see that what were they doing it was like since they were
the popular party that's democrat well that's the one tat they choose to be their how do you say it their leader but it wasn't really about because they saw something good was being done
aha
and i don't think it should be like that do you understand i think that if a candidate well you see he could be better well give him a chance
you're thinking of fanatics
right right
yeah for a face for a face and a
about some gestures but
well but ah almost always all the politicians promise i do this i to i do i do and when they arrive they forget of what they had to do
or or maybe they don't forget maybe they find a lot of a lot of opposition because specially when the party that wins is the the democrats and
and the republicans win most of congress well then it's much more difficult the task he has well they won't approve all the laws that they want and they won't approve all the things that he said that he wanted to do do you understand
and since they're majority and the ones that go to to vote and make the decision well many times i find it that it's difficult for him
a leader that that is good but the rest of his party doesn't win well it's very difficult you know eh the em em em
and you can not vote because you have not registered or because they want
to do all the best that he wants in favor of the community
because then the other ones don't give him a chance
i think that depending on on you know if if let's suppose if a democrat wins and almost all are democrats
but when a democrat wins and all the other ones are republican the make his life difi
but some also work for their own benefit not for the benefit right of the community
aha aha yes more bureaucracy i
what happens so fight and problems start and
yeah that's why i tell you that when when they don't belong to the same party there are always a lot of problems then some people want one thing and other something else
so no we never know what they are going to really to me i in politics well i'll tell you how i got involved
after i got here about about four years ago that i began to participate to take more action in the because i saw that they didn't want to approve a lot of things for hispanics
oh okay
that they were not treating us very well so i got involved in in politics but it's also a lot of bickering and they take out they air all your dirty laundry you know
everything they can air about you to find something if you go to to any position forget it they investigate your family and they air if you sell this if you had that if your son did this if your aunt is was that
so that's what i don't like i said no i can't be involved in this thing
so i keep working and i help them but i don't i didn't get involved you know to run anyway i have nothing to be ashamed but i don't like the
and specially i find that the white people here try to to manipulate a lot and to control a lot
specially in the republican party the democrats are a little more they have a little more of
of of this for the hispanics but republicans are kind of racists they only do things for them for them
but residents do not vote i thought they
yes i always vote
i had a time i thought well she said oh i will not vote for what but ah after me wrapped me working with one of the parties then i realized that yes we need to vote especially hispanics
for us to hear our voice and our vote there that counts
ah good evening mercedes speak of philadelphia
only with the line of the pol of the party
ah ok ok ok ah and from the let's say of what people well what people the eh the conception of that the eh democrats are more liberal and that the republicans are a little more
conservative what do you think about conservatives what do you think about that
yes
yes what i think also is that eh maybe like that eh ah ah they are not much of of being in the middle right but of
they are on one side well they are like very ex no very extreme but they have the extremes i believe that's why
mmh
so here it is like that eh and it is like that here too but sometimes that eh is my country is like that i say also but sometimes it is not too much eh eh i would like that they realized that maybe it is a matter with the person not so much the party
right or uh another thing i don't know because also uh it's on the other side of
um
nice to meet you good let's see we have to talk politics
um
but sometimes uh what i wanted to say too is that there's people that's like too much towards the party right
uh and that don't care
yes i mean that they don't maybe the candidate doesn't have the charity right but since they vote for his party uh that's what i sometimes uh i don't like but also at the same time
uh there's people that also goes for not only the qualifications uh intellectual or the candidate's abilities but his personal charm
that happens a lot in my country that's right uh people lets they fall in love like they say
uh uh and for what eh yeah about the life i don't know about the impression he gave them maybe not about uh
your resume or your curriculum right it's what you can or can not do
mhm
mhm
we think that to me is a bit difficult issue because i do not wear much well i have if as six years living here but never as not voting it never interested me enough for that is the policy of
mhm
yes
and and that is something that looks to me counterproductive right because one would think that when all is one wishes maybe an ideal world that once in power all would work for the well being of of everyone
exactly exactly and that's why let's say for example here as it's divided when they pass laws right that first congress then the senate and then the president right
but usually many laws come because they are initiatives from the president right but they have to pass the test in the senate and if the senate is of
the party co the majority is for the other party it's a big problem i mean it's good i think that is good because ah em
it makes it so there is so control right in eh balance between the two parties right but at the same time like it slows down the things and mayb like lik of more bureaucracy it's what i want to say
yes
and one other thing i've read that here in the united states for example i mean a lot of laws president's initiatives right
but usually they do them like a group right about eh about initiatives in a single document for example right because as they submit them once
because i am not a citizen yet
to to to the senate for example one day and they put as addendum or additions right to the law that this other law this other law maybe people don't support these others but they do support the main one
but as the other ones were attached to this one they don't approve it then they say no no we don't approve it because because of it right and maybe the main idea was the one everybody agreed but now
they have to start all over again
mhm
mm mm
mm mm
mm
yes
yes yes true i agree with that i do that maybe because they are i don't know
i'm just ah resident so i can not yet vote and
no no no i don't vote we don't vote one has to be uh citizens to vote you if you vote ever voted
ah
yes and you think of the democrats or the republicans and the differences between them
mhm
hi
yes okay very well
yes yes sometimes they stay with the surface a little no and they start to have well
um um
um um um
yes yes yes
ok he had like an air like pedantic no sometimes of knowing too much
and perhaps that i saw him a couple of times when he came here to philadelphia to do a pair of meetings
and to to me his message was i believe he said intelligent things but that he didn't he didn't finish reaching people he didn't finish
that of having enough charisma
um um ok ok
ok ok ok ok
um here well i'm surprised no the fact that there are only two big parties that people only have two options because well in spain is really
um um also the opposite no it is like or appears to be like one more an uncle well i am like all of you yes
yes yes yes yes that is the role he interprets as a matter of fact because he goes to see his family is a well someone who has a lot of money and it is a a start so that
no it is not ours we say but he is
n
yes yes yes yes ye yes yes yes yes
um um um um
but he is opposite to that yes yes yes
um um um um
um um um um um um
of course of course
even a little chaotic no because there is
um and what would you think about hillary clinton as candidate
yes
there are a lot of options then
um you have more conservative parties center ecologists more leftist then
for example i'm from barcelona then think there there are parties more catalonians less i don't know then
the options more or less bi i mean more or less big you have up to six more or less and then if you start counting the small parties you can have up to twenty
but those that have then representation in the parliament normally um just six parties then
instead here is just one i'm surprised no that's it then black or white
and and
i'm laia from philadelphia
yes that's the problem also that's the problem well because if there was
exactly exactly yes yes yes yes it's not that different you can you can feel a little underrepresented no almost
um um um um
sure
um um um um
um um um um
um um um um um um um um sure
um um
how what's his name
oh okay yes yes yes he was a man um
fine and you
yes um
um um um um um um
yes no he was a multimillionaire yes
yes yes right but i don't know there was in the end there was one
nader or naser or or or something like that ral ralph um
but of course to vote for him is a little but like throwing your vote in the trash right because you know that really it's not going to come to anything
um yes yes yes
yes um um um um
uh uh
of course of course
really good
right the the thing about spain is ah if you vote i don't know well you vote for a party that's very small
but then after that it is important because you know with the alliances that get established if none of the parties have the maximum control of the votes then a small party really can be decisive and very important to devide who governs that well has happened many times
in history then that is it is not a question to say ah since it is a small party then i will not vote for it because it is not going to serve any purpose because it is
it can really serve but of course in this system we have here it really is a
one or another no
yes yes yes yes
um
um um um um
of course
of course and it takes a lot of effort to break this this dynamic and also
well we have to talk about politics right
well with all the money that is needed no to run and the campaigns and
ah yes yes well i remember the first to win was bush actually people were very surprised it was not the first complication with this voting system with no loopholes and such
there really was so there was no confusion in which
it should therefore be the largest stable democracy but it's not
but
exactly exactly exactly
yes yes yes
two thousand
yes
yes it was very very strange
what
um um
yes yes
yes i was very surprised that that al gore that insist any more uh did not not protest more no because everything was so so weird so dark that
that i don't know i was surprised that they retired so soon that i don't know well well i don't don't understand that
uh uh well
hm yes and i guess things would have gone much uh different right
but well eh yes
yes yes yes
um um
and nothing the and the last ones also were a little well i don't know i felt sad because i really thought there would be a change no and the people
really
there would
um um um um
um um um um um um um um yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes i mean the second time it is undisputed i mean um
um
uh uh yes yes
because you can vote here
you you vote i mean you you are an american citizen i mean
of course um um um um ok ok ok
um um um
yes we have talk before oh nice
um
um um um
sure
sure yes yes yes
um um um um um sure sure yes yes at least a good thing that you have it there are only two terms per president no at least the next time well as bad as bush but well i doubt it right
yes there that was alright because in spain no no there's no limit
and i don't know if it would remain it power for years and years and years
and well also it's good that they revel
sure no even though eight although eight yes they've already been to do quite a bit yes yes yes
yes you know whose going to be the democratic candidate
i'm studying at university of pennsylvania here at philadelphia
yes yes yes
in two thousand in the eight
um um um um
but i don't think that kerry will run again no
i mean
um um
um
um um um um
of course ok
um um um um um um
hello
oh i remember well let's talk about politics
so you have to have a message like that simple
well of course and people believe whatever they hear but they believe things that are simple and clear
like people don't want to hear a lot with a lot of explanation things that are too complicated like you lose them
it is like you have to say things in a very direct form and in a way that is easy to understand like like without too many doubts
and i think that kerry was like too intelligent perhaps
um um
um
um
yes yes and gore was even worse that gore was like an intellectual
that people couldn't listen to him
what do you think how how a student from another country thinks about the politics here
i didn't understand him i felt he was distant strange cold
of course of course of course a neighbor the man who lives in the same block like one that
of course
of course i think he is very intelligent
i believe he looks like he is quite stupid
like to convince people he is not dangerours
like that like he is that way
i believe he is intelligent or if he is not intelligent at least the people in his government are intelligent
because they have done a lot of things no no like this not by coincidence it is like
none of these things have happened without a plan
um
so what
ah i like her ah eh i like her but i think that it is going to be difficult
um
right
um um
right
um look
look look
sure
hi i'm nicole i'm talking from new york
sure sure and sometimes they are not that different
grey and gray bad and worse
yes um yes yes there are some small parties that have a really different perspective but they don't have
they don't have enough support
and they don't have enough money
em so there are really only two parties
i mean when i mean we always have elections but when you go to vote they include the small parties in the ballot and eh when you vote but they get a minimal percentage of that vote
i think that just once in the history of the presidential elections one candidate a a a a man represented an independent party
he is ross perot eh
perot perot
hi how are you
that was many years ago i mean he did win lots lots of votes but
not enough as something to earn but
i don't know he was a very very rich man
right it's um he could be an idealistic person or from another perspective usually can't
he can't
um ah yes nader nader yes he is too
right right it isn't or rather it's for it's like for saying something symbolic
but not really to vote for him because no he's not going to win you know that
eh he has a lot of ideas very very good ideas in my in my opinion but
i wouldn't vote for him simply because it matters a lot to me who
fine
who is really going to be president
um
of course um
of course
no it is always republicans and democrats always
of course
and since the beginning of times it has been this way that is many years ago there were other parties but
yes at least the last one hundred years
it has been this way
um
ehm
um yes and think that people in in spain or what do you think of of of the things that have happened here with the elections
so close and counting the votes and all that mess
um um yes
um
sure sure it's like the only one
it is this country who should send people to other countries to monitor elections to see that they are legal
and at the same time and our own choice is something so complicated and difficult to understand
and really in the end it is the last election of the year
i mean that was in the year two thousand
this election near the end was almost like they were being paid
politics we spoke before right
for connections because bush bush's brother eh it was the
the governor of of florida is like like everything was a thing of as if it was
as if it was happening in a different place
um yes yes
uh
yes yes me too i also see it like that like like is going is going to say already
uh um um
yes yes there would be another another story now or rather
i imagine five years later
all the things that have happened
i think we spoke before
uh yes me too me too the last time really
the first time it felt much much anger i like like people really
the majority voted for gore and still they installed bush and i was outraged and the second time i felt sadness
because people voted for bush
how were they how could they vote for him again after all that had happened
i thought what country is this i mean who was voting
i don't know i don't know
of course well i voted but
yes yes yes yes i ama citizen i mean i was born here
well yes but i don't know the system really has to send i believe
i think so are you from spain
because well well the government has to change too ut the system of voting is very
it's very unfair because they go by state
it shouldn't be like that it should be the majority wins
point
or rather why go by states that gives a lot of power to the smaller states
um um
um/
sure
sure yes yes yes i agree with that because every eight years it's eight years or rather that it's ah it's quite a long time
we'll see what happens next i don't know
before we talked abuout you being a student in a local university right
no still no it's very it's still very early and that's because
it will happen in the year two thousand
eight i mean the campaign will already start in two thousand seven i mean in two more years
eh but until now no we don't know
no
no kerry really was not he was not a very strong candidate
really democrats need someone more charismatic like with more personality
with more with a clearer message for people
to see that nowadays i don't know how it used to be but nowadays you need you need in politics to have a much clearer message for people because people
gets confused quickly and like they don't don't pay much attention like they don't have much interest
david hi wendy
oh a little bit not much it's that i haven't talked with many people that may be
to help him to you know to diret him in his in his life you know
and and they just want to be helped themselves to them to give them donations to be helped here they want uhm food they want time
ehm you know it takes a lot of time from from one's life
you know ehm too
um
we all went
yes
that is why because they're fried from from the old time then that's how they that's how they were brought up the old time the old timers
eh yes the church was a lot every sunday we had to go to church you know and and what happens in in these years
no no the the
for for
when you're growing up you lose your interest in church
and then then one one isn't passing through that same upbringing to your children
and hm mm
the service
yeah uh i didn't speak to many people regarding the survey
yeah
oh really
oh
oh uhhuh okay
so you are in arizona how is the climate down there
oh yes
oh are you on a cell phone or are you at home
oh how are you
oh in your car
ohoh
what happened
oh this is religion yeah out there eh i have three days talking about the same story it never changes
no it never changes the topic
right
oh no in those days those no now we have like four or five days that the topic is the same of religion
yeah and
yeah but men oh people they get angry
it's a bad topic men
in arizona here is connecticut
and yeah
no no the people that i have talked to comes one comes from la
right
right yeah
yeah no
yeah it is very controversial because people get
let me tell you they get very mad that is the other that not that the
well well and that no
if because
well for for for me is tha the people that is everybody believes in their in their religion no but there are different different peoples
yeah i believe i spoke with you before
there are different persons uhm different parts of the world like the chinese and the the the the muslims the buddhists and the catholics the
there are different you know because they don't have the same upbringing
then right so then who who is someone to say that the the religion of one is better than the other
good but but the people gets very brave you're attacking you're attacking their religion you know
its ah
it's a topic to talk about let me tell you
because i am catholic too but you know i'm i when i was little i was um my mom always took me to the church but then when i was when i was eighteen already i mean i got married and i got married at at the catholic church
and and and everything but for mi it's you know it's like so many troubles that had the the the hards
at the catholic church you know i mean
with so many money you put so many money that's hard you know everybody works hard for their money
i believe that i i spoke with you last week
so for i mean sure at the at the for for a donation for the church for the church to help the other people the other people
and they're helping one one another they help themselves because all the money the families give for them to shut up
you know that money you know
and they were millions millions of dollars
no
yeah i mean up here where we are as i saw i am i live near massachussets
and all the problems were at the massachussets florida and new york churches
that they were busy with young boys
and well for about thirty years the church knew priests had problems
they paid the family so they would remain silent
yes your voice sounds familiar
yeah and all that moeny came out from the collection fee all the moeny came out of the church and there were millions and millions of dollars
two hundred thousand a hundred thousand
you know
it depends i mean
um including the the the the people who go to church
no
i'm sorry of your salary already but
yeah you tides you do your your tides but the the
if if they do that and if they investigate you like it's a wcw two let me see your your your your your your paycheck
you know you make yea but you can't go to church
yes yes i'm from from texas right
yeah if
but it's the same thing i know a church that's here but the the church when i was there and it's big and the people who go there
have priests and you know that i mean because the whole world has your name on the envelope and this is not you only gave twenty dollars this week
you have to give twenty two dollars no you win six hundred and fifty dollars less taxes
you need to give the chur to the ch to the church thirty and this so much you know and they they wait they expect it
yes
hm
hm mm
it's whatever you give um um yeah
aha
you live in texas

twentythree ok you're still young i'm forty years old
when we went to the school was very different the church was not very demanding it was more for you know
um more
more yeah you know you went to to go to church because you went to pray
you know then one would pray more and and it was more for the person than for the church
then these days it is more for the church than the the person
you know ehm that is the key you want to go to church so that you could help the church
you know instead of keeping the business this or that that he needs help and for everybody to go backwards you know but ehm honestly
the church is for the for the youth or you know for the person
hi my name is wendy
