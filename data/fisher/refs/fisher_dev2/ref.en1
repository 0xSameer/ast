now there are many divorces
mm
mhm uh huh

ah ay she there was with him there enduring everything good and bad
ah yes yes that is what happens yes well my mother my mother when m when she became a widow because my father no he died then she no she couldn't remarry
she never she never remarried she's one of those oldfashioned moms she said i won't marry again i already endured one i won't endure another one
ah from puerto rico ah ok
yeah
yes yeah
yes that's what happens every one has their own destiny
their karma as we call in the vedic philosophy
yeah do you know about karma
ah nice
hmm
mmmm
yes that is true no each action has a reaction and if you act in a good way you will receive good things
otherwise you will get bad things and that is also a way to understand right
then
you know all the pain they are suffering everything is karma
mmm
ah ok
mmmm
mmm
yes that's true
yes talk about what and things but we have to use the word marriage i guess
hello good af good evening
ah ok
ah well it's very good
no no
no i was married but now no yes
well and have you spent many years here in atlanta
same as me i've spent 10 years i arrived here in 94 in order to go to college
ah okay
well one could say that one could say that you are already from atlanta then
more or less but you go back to peru every now and then
ah okay
ah well look at that i am from
it becomes difficult no
sometimes it's difficult you get so involved in your own lives and becomes difficult to return to your homes
yeah exactly i know i can get a flight to puerto rico if it is in sale is not that expensive you can get one
at least 200 round trip
but if it is not on sale you'll be paying like 500 or 600 per person
yes it's like a three hour flight
i imagine is really expensive
do you have any family here
oh
well they said we can talk about anything but you know
yes we are quite close is this the first call you have taken
if you want to talk about marriage well we can talk about some marriage
i don't know mine took three years and it was sincere it was because i got married you know young
and not us well you know we had a clue that they weren't
comparable one with the other so then when we started real life that
lets say well we couldn't maintain the relationship
no
no
no and we couldnt you know we got divorced but stayed friends even though i haven't heard from him in years but we left you know
it wasn't bad we didn't hate each other nothing like that
and i always want the best for him but simply that we made an error cause of our age and our maturity
ah i i am without cell phone they called me three times but i was at the store i couldn't you know take ten minutes to talk
we did that
yeah thanks god
well that means that you met your husband here right
in atlanta
uh but is he also from peru
oh ok and do you have children
oh that´s nice
oh god bless you
i hope some day yes but if not you know i´m happy with my life
yes let´s see yes because i i said after that i said that next time i will not marry until i know that
but where are you from
and it´s not into my heart that it´ll be forever
no matter what will come i can handle it and i can make it last
so the let's see
yes that is the most important
loving and have faith
don't know then your parents remain in peru
ah okay
ah then my mom and dad moved here after i moved
and then my my brother followed too and all i now have all my family here
yes my mom lives near the airport and mom and dad have i think they will make thirtyfive this year in december
puerto rico
of marriage yes
yes
yes they met when mommy was two years older than daddy but they met when daddy was teen four no sorry fourteen years old and mommy was sixteen
and they were boyfriend and girlfriend almost immediately and since that day until today they are together
so that that is a positive marriage of which we could speak
yes
yes what happened with well you know of course mommy loves daddy a lot and that has a lot to do with it but also what happened with my mother was that she
came from a poor family a single mother
and she never had anything that she s could call that was you know her own
and then when she met my father and it was the lov love of her life and she got married then now she had something her family it was
yes yes
you know her belongings
and she so much for that
yes exactly exactly
ah
no becau but they say and maybe it's true right for every person there's only another another soul
you know another person that's meant to be with them
and after you have that person in your life if they if something happens and that person leaves well you know you don't need to find someone else because you were already satisfied
yes
exactly their karma
oh yes
well yes eh they said that we can talk about meta marriage or talk about anything
oh yes it's important to know about that because many people don't want to be responsible for their actions and they think they don't
they won't pay what they do
and that is not ok
exactly
exactly
i believe in karma too
how does it goes for my own spiritual ideas
but even if someone believes in karma only scientifically like an energy energy can not be destroyed
therefore if you build up a negative energy that energy has to go somewhere
and it will come back to you because you created it
ah ok then we already used it right are you married
and from a spiritual point of view which i beleive god created us for making the best of our lives but we are responsible of our acts
hello
oh yes he became independent
ah you have just moved
ah ok and already you eh all and they are still missing you right
mmh
yes yes i am i am married
eight
ah look well my children are still small one is seven and the other just turned three two days ago
yes time goes by very quickly and one doesn't even notice their age and children grow up
ah yes
aha
good evening
yes
oh and yes now yes
yes marriages now the ones that really last are very rare
no now for any thing and problems and right then they just separate like that
many times no
they don't try don't don't tr don't try to improve things in their marriage
no he is american
oh yes mine is black american
mine is black american
oh no i here the one that has lighter skin
oh my name is norma from atlanta georgia
no my husband is a black person but he is very nice
oh no it's that american women are now wel very independent they want to do right
oh
right
oh of course it's just that all of a sudden no they don't right
they don't value a lot like before right now is different all the mindset has changed for the ma for the marriage
oh
right
right
ah yes how outrageous isn't it
oh okay how are you
ah yes the husband is the wife is who ma manages e
ah yes
it's that suddenly like one as a latin woman is used to sometimes it's that is a a society more more patriarcha patriarchal than anything
then one will always be because of the because of the way one grows up isn't it that suddenly one is like that more flexible
uh huh
heh
sure suddenly that's why they separate as well no there are too many divorces
marriages don't last one of the
of the factors
aha
oh here yes good so so with the kids
it's that as a good latin one many times eh have are used to no raise your voice
ah
ah yes societies are different one even if it doesn't seem so no even if at the beginning it doesn't look like it but there are really many differences differences in culture no
aha
ah you
aha
sure yeah i also had a or i have a friend that married an american and he says that latin women are so different
yes really he a he appreciates enough he says
no because he the latina women are very different no no they don't make they don't make many problems
ah yes one is more faithful i suppose
oh okay
it shows no that one is more faithful really
more more much more loyalty
mhm
uh huh
of course yes it's very awful no that now the marriages don't last long and really if they have children the children are those that suffer
yes
aha
ah yes
ay poor kids
mm of course
yes yes i have two kids
yes the kids suffer eh a lot they get traumatized when they are very little and have all those problems no at home
they get quite traumatized
mmh
of course
ah yes it is really a pity no there are so many
lot of time the government removes the children to such people when they do not get along
no they do psychological abuse or
or physical physically
mhm
ah yes then
oh yes and also of two
ah yeah the fight hard
aha
oh they are really big they are teenagers
hello

and are you married
how many years
ah i am eighteen it is the in november
ah still yes yes i once in a while look at the pictures of my little one and say oh my god how muh time has gone by

then and he is angry i am not his girlfriend her boyfriend that is my mom i see you and children are so small you should be happy that they think that your mom looks younger
good evening yes my no my name is tami
but great great aha but ultimately what i have noticed also is that people
here is is very fast to to get a divoce
nobody wants to work the marriage
hmm
hmm
no there is patience
your hus is your husband latino
mine too
yes that one you gave me what
mine is white i am the black one
oh i am from here in washington washington state
oh
oh yes oh yes my husband alway tells me he says thank god because i'm from panama and he says thank god that i was sent to panama and i met you
because american women he says to me
i don't like them he he says not much about the independent it that they don't respect marriage
he that's what he says to me no he doesn't say that it's because i am i am very independent but
i always take care of him
you know i don't give him
no uh um yes it's it's so different because my husband works with some guys
and they my husband's work peers are american right
and the the women give them like twenty dollars every two weeks for lunches they keep the rest those are americans then he can it's very funny it's just that my husband has an xbox so they get to play it here at home right
oh very well and you
and i laugh because my husband gets called it's like they're teenagers can he play today and he says mi wife won't let me and i laugh and i say to him stop it
and you your wife lets you do whatever you want the others they have to i laugh i say hey
working all day at least one hour to relax right
like that and like that i do laugh because when as well it's that they go to lunches to the to the work of my husband i tell him when you want to go go i don't care
he tells me ow that we couldn't go because the other wasn't allowed to i say who didn't let him and says the wife he him he called her
uh huh totally
i say no way we
mhm
yes that what i i imagine is a little more flexible and they like that and after one they are at peace they are at peace with you
but with these women i say that this one will go away
i was here painting my house
because they have him like that so tight that that man will look for another place
mhm but not e
they don't understand
mhm i tell you no my husb my my children always laugh because barely is that my husband and i we don't don't shout at home and that if anything that i'm calling him and eh
i have a loud voice since i'm on the second floor of the house
my son says don't fight i tell him that i'm not fighting i'm shouting
aha exactly and my son i always tell him and they tell me to stop shouting friend do you want me to tell you when i am shouting i can show you i th
ah so that
it's it's that many differences
yes it's it's so funny because my husband knows ho since i met him um he like didn't know how to dress very well
and they called me i say okay oh god then are you married
so i always i always choose his clothes
in the morning i say i eh it doesn't bother me i choose it and since they give him a hard time at work i say well
he is the only one that looks good at work why do they give him a hard time
i say of all of those that have holes in their pants and the women that you don't see and for nowhere and i tell my husband i don't give him a hard time and he dresses well what's their problem with him
and he laughs it doesn't matter to me that that he says i'm happy with my woman he says i say well so no eh
mhm
and yes it's that
no and we when we love we love hard
uh huh that is true
yes but here
me too i
mhm
here no here it's not important to him i have a the friend of a best friend of my husband got married and in five years they were divorced and it was that prostitute and that
other women and that i don't know what and i say oh my god and we stuck in the middle because i was a friend of his wife and my husband was best friends with him
oh god i said to him do not stick me in the middle oh i that and oh i say that yes is bad don't ask me what she said because i'm not going to tell you
but so rapi
yes yes i have one here my neighbor here to the side
ah she married a man and he had a son who was already eight ah eight years old
and they had two and this woman she was the boy in the face
don't touch my children you are not my child and i don't know what and i here i say ay i would like to grab that kid and bring him here to my house
because like i saw some times i tell her the other day i told her you know that i am in my house i don't want to hear your conversation about what that you are calling your exhusband dirty and i don't know because you are talking so laud
yes i have two kids well one is nineteen and the other is fifteen
and your kids i say poor kids who are hearing all that those bad things that you say about their dad
and she says don't
mmh
and she got the husband out of the house and she got another boyfriend there
i say oh my god you didn't even give time to to the man who had left there and you already had another
and that one too how he yells at the children how he yells at the children
i say
mm if this woman
don't work
yes that's true this women doesn't work the father bought here the house and gives her money monthly
right yes and the older already left the home
but listen i though that if they give you money every month you can do something help others or whatever don't stay there in the house and i think that's the reason for her being frustrated
because she doesn't do nothing and with all those kids that badly strive i say thank god i don't have to scold them because they are near me with that stone strip and don't know what
ah ah and i with my husband i wasn't talking with
i he came to shout at me here at my house and i sent hum at my husband and he watched me like he said i never saw you like that and i say right the latins your better not annoy them when

i mean something like two plus two is four four plus four is eight a lot of math
to learn how to spell as well theres a song that shows you how to write a word it teaches you how to sing the word so you can remember how to spell it
there's a lot of thing out there with music everything is music because many kids learn while talking my kid would learn a lot with music
okay
he learned about the time tables with music i taught him that way you know
ha
yeah that's exactly it
aha aha aha
for you know that i i made for my oldest son for my oldest son i would record songs for him that i would read to him in english
my brother recorded them to him in spanish
so one day he would hear them in spanish next day in english
in a biccle yes yes and he had the book so then we bought him the book in spanish would fullow the story in spanish he was very very was very my brother says put it in spanish too not just english
because i him i read him many stories sometimes i was tired so i put it on a tape and he played by himself and would hear the story
he did not have to i to read the same story sixty and thousand times
maybe what kind of music do you like i like merengue
because when they are little like that one has to read a lot
exactly exactly
exactly yes
yes yes it is true it is true yes anyway how many minutes do we have i am already tired listen i worked so hard oh my god
and at work also i keep singing let me tell you
the day seems to pass faster when i sing i don't let people who are arguing or fighting bother me
i'm always singing yes they call me the singing clerk because i'm always singing
i must sing yes yes yes
oh yes and they talk terrible
terrible they talk terrible i don't know how their mothers i went to a party
i like charismatic music um putting it in the catholic church
and the girl who i think was three years old was playin that kind of music i just cut it off
i said it's a party for kids and i brought my own music i always do because i act as a clown so i played my music and the kids went like this is music for the olders we don't want this
they wanted the music yes and i told the mother how can you play this kimd of music this boy saying fu
and all this dirty talking i said how terrible
yes yes yes yes yes
yes
aha
yes it's true the games those games
that are so violent oh my god
you know the moms and the dads buy them to take the boys from their sight
we are putting lots of music in charismatic one of them that sings is miguel aquino me too oh its like merengue but with with jesus christ in the music
but they are terrible because some of them are there all day long i have a nephew that gets into his room all day long to listen to music and play those games you can't see him
you can't see him and he's fourteen years old
yes yes yes yes
aha aha
yes aha i feel sorry for the kids that are growing up now
yes yes and less social because of that
when you are in front of the computer or listening music
you aren't social you don't start talking with people or anything
you don't want to see people
ok yes yes my kid is the same he doesn't like to talk with people i tell him that he has to be more social
how are you good evening
oh okay oh okay
yes we had to talk about music um well i like music no music salsa it is called
no what is eh is it hispanic no hispanic music also music we play at church also which we call quirta
no which is in the sanskrit language which is also very very upbeat
and i also like romantic music no ballads that ah well now i think that they are called ballads
yes yes those those kinds of musi uhum
uhum
ah of course you are the the what who acts like a clown
uhu of course there your profession demands it
of course because in order to make children happy you have to move no
oh i'm norma im from atlanta georgia
aha
sure of course it is something it's a it's an active episode no
you want them if you want for example to teach them something to teach them a lesson like that with humor then it's very important that the kids
like that they they feel they're a part of that they're a part of the program
uh huh
uhm huh
like that it's good all that uh huh
uhm huh
sure yes that is a lot of times when using music no
it's like that people remember more things that happen
oh are you sure i don't know
no i mostly the kids and they're receiving training no they have more memories they have more memory then
like if it stick on his mind easier
aha
uhm huh
uhm huh
uhm huh
cl
sure music is part of the culture and each culture have his own music
and is identified by this mus people identify each culture not with a particular music for example the hispanic culture many
didn't identify it with salsa merengue those quick driven dances this music
ha
no and many people like that um hu
to that the fourteenyearold
to he hes i remember then
well yes i have music my husband it is more him who likes music more than i
no he really likes music he plays a little it of piano
yes and he he then this we have lots of devotional music like from our siquirta church
what he has learned to play the harmonium and bridanga and cartals
al that we are also teaching my children
yes aha
yes that and music is very important especially in churches
i don't know maybe
no music always gives you a good message
not for people its so that people can remember no i see it differently even when i watch tv
christians also have their own kind off music they sing they get emotionally involved
and everythings with music music actually influences if peoples life's a lot
um hu
yeah um hu
um hu
um yeah because now for example when kids learn their abc's
you know that famous abcd song
just my little one that is three years old is also there with his with his games he is there that has a game about a train that we bought him because his birthday was a few days ago
maybe everything and the group is huge
so it is there over there with songs the alphabet so then he records it there and the song is being recorded there
um hu
like that that is good aha
un hu
like that yes because children when they are little are like a little sponge they learn everything
no everything that stay engraved on their minds there is no yes it is the best time to teach them
better the better things good habit
to
sure um uh
well it's good to cheer up your spirit
ha
well it depends i say music as well because there is a kind of music which i don't like which is rap young people use it
i don't like this kind of music it's terrible
yes to
um uh
oh my god yes they say so many'lizura'
sure they learn from there kids talk that way they hear abou violence and all that stuff
heavy stuff for kids
precisely for that now there are not many many boys and they get into so much trouble the teenagers start to use weapons and all those consequences of the influence they have
all the
from all the music from all that all that they see on television and all the violent things
uhum
um hu oh those games too those games
yes
um hu
oh my god of course and the kids on top of that also that's why many times the influences no the lack of activity the kids there is a lot of child obesity
no they are are inactive they are in front of the computer using their games or with the television
no that's why there's people they are there are no kids
yes the kids always now are more like inactive
mmm
sure
mmm
oh what is that spiritual music with merengue
sure they isolated
hello hello
it's popular music not rock or anything like that he plays the guitar and sings

oh uhumm
oh uhumm oh
oh humm
oh
i was born here
no yes
hello good evening this is mildre from connecticut
what country are you from
made sense things had a moral values that uh that gave you a message
oh
dominican
aha
yeah right but you don't speak too dominican more like
mhm
i so eh no i'm not puerto rican and salsa music
i like dancing
i find that the music helps us know more countries at least puerto rico has big eh composers writers and we have artists like
jennifer lópez marc anthony
oh yes aha yes we have talked
gilberto santa rosa that are known in lots of countries
oh i think the music i like it a lot i put it when i'm at home dance while cleaning and do it faster it pleases me it removes my depressions
whenever i feel sad
or when i feel nostalgic for my country
then i listen the songs that that were sung and my mother too
and you do you like music
oh
mhm
aha
so then how old is the child
how are you everything fine
oh okay then so that is the musical stage
they say that children that that are raised with music are since the womb get very relaxed and learn they are like even more intelligent
i don't know if that might be true but
aha
yes no while the boys sh the girls the best of times
i think that children
four or five years more less
well then they forget a lot of things
yes
oh
fine thank you very well
oh _ like that like that is good uhm retarded children learn a lot through music
my son's partner had a baby with down's syndrome
he used to play him music and he would learn everything very fast
he learn very fast
and he learned the songs by memory
ok
ok
ok ok
yes she exercises mhm
yes the help is good for her to get to know her body parts and at the same time relaxes her with the music
i think that we talked about marriage
right right
i like it i go a lot to the concerts when there are salsa concerts when there are concerts of
of merengue i don't of merengue i don't go too much so what i like most i like the typical music a lot the music of of
how is call like we could say of our field inside
the full the bomb all that and after when in
new york make presentations of of of bomb and full so we go there
and we go to the the olga tañon's concerts
that she has a lot of nice music and this guy that plays salsa this eh my god what is victor manuel
i don't miss their concerts we always go
there are many concerts here and we always go
aha
aha
yes because yes if in your family is more
dominican well i imagine that you dance more dominican music
oh really
aha
aha they left
oh and now they stayed there
like a boy from from my girl's class they asked him which country he was from and he said i'm a mix salad and they told me why because my dad is
my dad is from this country my mom from another my grandparents from he had a mix of race there that he says i don't even know what i am
aha aha
aha aha aha
i have shown all the traditional music of my country to my daughters
i've shown her the dances shown her the music but no no they haven't listened to it much but the know how to dance it
and then i was part of the group of the puerto rican stop
and we made dancing presentations i was in charge of teaching the girls to dance to dance bomba to dance full
to dance salsa
so my girls know how to dance because they both like a lot of music
all love the music
yes the traditional music is pretty much prettier
i also like the peruvian music i find it beautiful
the music of the chinese indian i love their music nice but do not understand what it says
i see
but the sound they have you know it relaxes you
when i went to puerto rico i bought record of those that brings you water sounds
of trees of
when you want to relax when you're very tense so put that music and it sounds good precious
sounds very nice
uh
yes oh without any message or nothing
and that one comes with the one to keep and make purchases and go shopping
that's why i say that music is very important for well at least for me
because i grew up with all my family with music always
today is the music
my children my daughter is is seventeen years old so she is with the liking for the reggaeton and the hip hop and all that kind of music
my daughters are older now and they hear more american music
and
i for exam rock and rock i listen to and i share it with the boys but it's like i can't listen to it for a long time
it makes me nervous like really agitated
i don't like rock and roll a lot i listen to it and i have some young friends who have a a band
and sometimes they ask me to go see them and i go and spend a while with them but then i say ouch no let's go let's go because my head is kind of throbbing
with the those sounds in my ears
oh yes that reggaeton thing now
i think that that older music is very different than today's composers used to uh to deal with more romantic things things that
hello
yes
hmm
i don't mind the music so much what bothers me is the lyrics what they say
yes that i like that kind of music but not what they say and that's why
hmm
yes
so right i was born in puerto rico but we moved in the us when i had 5 or 6 years but my father are dominicans
so i do i feel like i am
no no i feel dominican and not even a bit puerto rican because i spent every summer in santo domingo with my family and i like ay i forgot my godmother
that took care of me was puertorican so then you know i have something from both
no but you know depends of the depends of my mod
and you
mhm
mhm
mhm
i think that i already spoke with you ehm this is annie from miami
yes
mhm mhm
yes
mhm
i like it i always listen to christian music
eh but also eh you know as i have a little girl i try to teach her or going to show different types of music so i always have it what she listens
eh classical music or latin music for children
eh or or english eh you know the music you put when you teach the colors or the alphabet things like that and right now at this stage of my life i am more
as you know with music for children
let's say the music i like more
but
she goes has twenty months
yes and
i don't know tonight we went shoppin and she was in the car uhm singing the that song about the alphabet
you know and my husband looks at me and tells me but not her you know a little young for that i told her i don't know but she is singing it
you know
yes
yes
well to me all
i always forgot a lot of things as well so that but that uhm you know music for us is something very very very uhm uhm
you kno important we do not watch much television
yes fine and you
so that all that she let's say learns from animals whatever it is are because of music and and the books we read
yes
ok
mhm mhm
yes
i can´t remember what she sings but we have a cd
my aunt the aunt monica or something like that
she likes to dance and when people sees her they say oh my god
it's been about three weeks since the last time she heard that song she used to start the day listening to that song but she still remembers the song
you know i like it because she moves her feet her knees the head you know she enjoys it
ehm i don't recall what was the topic that we gave us the last time
we can also do the movements and she would learn the parts ok
she learns the parts of the body so now you know it
and the language also because what we are doing is she is you know i when my husband is not at home i speak with her only spanish
then when he arrives eh completely well sometimes ninety percent english you know i speak spanish because i am used but
in that way she can get both languages and that is the other reason because we have a lot of music with her for her to listen it in english and spanish
right
the full and things like that
mhm
mhm
mhm
that was it that was it that you have
mhm
since
mhm and us for me i prefer the the merengue
instead of salsa
but
eh well it´s the same because my parents lived in in puerto rico i think that it was about twenty something years before coming to the united states so
you know no it's not that i don't think we're not a typical family
because they liven in santo domingo then the revolution that they had to
they went to puerto rico and from puerto rico they came to miami
so yes so you know they spent a long time in puerto rico and much because that's what i say that i don't know what country i'm from because i'm like
five children wasn't it
a mix of of you know of both
yes th that's how i feel many times because many times i don't feel not not comfortable but you know i don't feel very puerto rican
and i don't feel very dominican it depends
like so but you know i i enjoy both cultures and it's not that it's soo different but you know they have have some eh
words that that
mhm
yes
mhm
mhm that is pretty
mhm
yes
i
and also what what to me the salsa you know is good or whatever but i think that allt he music i like the traditional music
you know yes and how not yes no i don't know i like it more and i like to watch her dance more than when people dance the salsa or whatever
mhm
yes
uh
mmm oh how nice
mhm
yes that's good also we often do when you know like right now before of of this call we had came from making the shopping
in five minutes what we do is turn on the radio and we put like you know a song that music is average
and is
only only instrumental doesn't have any lyrics
and that uh and that also it helps me you know to relax or whatever
yes
mhm
mhm
oh yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
hi uhm what's your name
what do you think of cell phones do you have one
i don't have one right now when i was in europe i had a phone
but here i don't have one because is very expensive
and i have little money because i'm student
and i decide to don't have a cell phone but that is not the only reason i never liked the cell phones i'm not sure they are healthy
because the radiation they emit is there any research
proving they really are not harmful
and i don't want to use a phone my whole life and after twenty years they find out that is bad for my health
and everyone has brain cancer or something like that
sure and you don't know until after it was good or not
pilar
i see that is a pity but
yes that on top of it is also more dangerous
that is very dangerous there are many accidents now less already because people us that headpiece or or free hands i don't know how it is called
but a lot of people continue to not use it and when you don't have one hand i don't know how they can drive well
hm
yes because sometimes it is true at times in the in the
on the bus on the people talk on their cell phones very loud
and that is a lack of respect no
because it is not necessary to talk that loud either one can talk lower right
yes yes well but i think they used the satellite phones the cellular ones didn't work too well because sometimes they would work and yes
same here where are you calling from
yes sometimes it would work and other times it didn't
but well it is it is true that the advantages that i see are that you can always be found
if your battery doesn't die if they need you for anything or need to speak to you
they can always locate you and that's very good
and and then also in case of an emergency
you can call if your car gets stranded in the highway or i don't know if anything happens to you you can call and ask
and ask for help and that's very good that's why when i have more money and can afford to pay it i'm going to get a cellular phone but what i'll do is use it with those earphones
do they have those here in in the united states also
ah well i'll find out about that because eh
sure
where do you where do you say you live
sure because too in the other one in the contract you have to pay every month
and also almost always they are plans in which the calls are already included making them more expensive
in e in europe i had a plan where you paid for a basic service and and the calls you would have to pay them separately but if you made few calls
then it was much more cheaper
sure
hm
sure
hmm i think that it got to europe first
the cell phone and that there are countries i i have lived in austria and over there it was the the eighty more than eighty percent of the people would have a cell phone
that is the the few that didn't have a cell were the younger children or the or the older people to whom it reaches already too late and don't want to use it
in oh i don't know that place
everybody had a cell phone and and but well it's just that i'm here in the united states since some time then i left and came back and when i was there that was three or four years ago
no no one used cell phones people didn't have cell phones
and in europe everybody had cell phones now i've come back and here everybody has cell phones or in other words in other words they have arrived here too and i think it's more or less the same already
yes yes the people that more than anything speak loudly in the subway in the bus and well i mean that's not impolite but there are people who walk on the street talking
with the headset instead of putting the phone to the ear they carry the phone in the pocket and the tiny headset can't bee seen and they go around talking and then it looks like they are speaking to themselves and
yes and you are left thinking that he is crazy and what could be be wrong with him
but already i've gotten used to it now if i see someone talking to himself in the street i already think he has a cell phone but well another difference is that there in europe people use text messaging a lot which i think here no one uses
there are short text messages
that are written with the cell phone and it's very cheap it's just perhaps twentyfive cents to send a message well it is cheap in europe
here calls are obviously cheaper but i don't know but eh here a call costs um about twentyfive cents per minute
ah huh
and eh the minimum is one minute and and on the other hand text messages well they cost you twentyfive cents each message and when you call you always have to talk for more than a minute almost always
then
sure
that doesn't matter sure
but there well there it was very popular specially between students
because they are fastest that have to write because write with a phone is complicated because you only have nine keyboards and every letter that are there
but the students turn it in kind of a game of skill even there are contest of who could write more faster
and they safe a lot money sending messages one time to time than calling even they had tactics a kind of language
and sure if you call and hang up without hook
it stays to write who has been called
hmm
then these young people use that for call so you can say they give signals when they call you missed call
when you do a missed called you call you get down that i'm waiting for you downstairs or sometimes to demostrate that they remember you then
they call and hang and now i remember you instead of send an email or simply that's a message of
i remember you i mean that people in europe have a lot of imagination to save money yes
a lot of cre a lot of creativity
aha but
sure yes
but it's really good
eh but if you use it more like combinations that you use it with the head with the with the earphone earplug whatever it's called
the earphone but that v that's far so not radiation
i'm from spain and i live i live in new york
just in case
and what
of course
have you heard about next gen phones which are arriving now
ah no i was
well i guess also that but i was referring about the ones where you could watch tv also
you can watch via internet you can check your email it has everything you might need it's like a mini computer with internet connection someday it will come it has been prepared long time ago but it never arrives
there are ones in europe in austria went out to market last year
i never saw it or used because it was more expensive but that would be good
hmm
no no it's apparently it's people from all euro from all the usa i've talked with people from well we had to talk about the cell phones no
oh i see it communicated with the machine
hello
ah yes yes yes
i have a cell phone but the truth it is like i don't have it because i almost don't use it to call
yes it's very rare when i use it and you
hm mm
yes
hm mm
yes why why
hm mm
hm mm
hm yes
my name's mercedes and you
like almost everything you start using technology let's say now with the teflon they are doing the same
yes
and but let's say and you have to drive what do you think about the presien for example about the the ones that drive and are on the cell phone at the same time
and that is really terrible i do agree when it comes to that
hm mm hm m
for someo i think that for me it doesn't bother mm ehm it is the people that don't have any respect on how they use their cell phones
that is true that is that they don't have any type of etiquette in the way in which they use their
their cell phone
hm mm hm mm
exactly
ah nice to meet you
and and but more i think that for me above all is the people that do not respect where are they calling the phone and the people that drive but
well that is the con the convenience since that is right there the phone the cell cell phone is a technology well that does make communication easier in a lot of of
of situations for example right now with the hurricane it was the only way in which many people could communicate with their families
yes that's true because we have a friend that was in new orleans and we tried calling him on the cellular and yes i know it was like it had been disconnected
the network
and it didn't work hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
hm mm hm mm
hm mm
hmm i live in but i'm from honduras originally
but also they have the ones with cards right they have some that have cards that you buy the card and only use what's on the card
mm i i understand they sell them in walmart
yes yes yes because they say that there's no because one problem is that you have to sign a contract right and the contract is never less than one or two years
and i understand that with this one there is not need to sign a contract and one has a card and one buys then what ones is going to use then
hm mm
yes
sure ehm yes and let's say that that is the problem that i you we have right now the plan that i have like i say almost i have the cell phone but i barely use it
and in cons at least we have one of the ones that the minutes accumulate but and they get accumulated so much that we will never use all of them
there is no possibility then of of for us to use them
but well that is that since they keep accumulating and and let's say in europe the way the cell phone culture is it is similar to the cu the one here in the united states or
in
hm mm
hm mm
hmm
and but i mean that they are the same problems that are here people that have no respect about where they use their cell phone or
that has happened to me i'm all like is he talking to me or to whom
hmm
hm hm mm
hm mm
i think i do really agree that i think it is not so common here
eh in my country let's say it is a little more common but i think that it is the same about the personal finances of the people right because how we say it i well
it's west of the city of philadelphia
in my country there is not so many money like here true here twentyfive pennies are nothing for the people
exactly
mmm
mmm i couldnt
hmmm
hmmm
ok
ok
hmm
imagination many yes ah
past the next town is
a lot of creativity that's the word yes no i well as i say i would have to practice a lot to become a bit but no and as i say as i almost never use it
the truth the only one and the the truth is that i do u i have it but above all for emergencies and if
one day i had a flat tire in the car
above all i the truth is uh huh
no
yes yes yes
yes yes
i should buy one of those because it's really dangerous and well i only talk with my husband in my family and always
where he is driving if he is driving he hangs up the phonei don't want him to be driving and talking
almost never really a really few times
and you
are those the ones with credit cards and information inside them
no
what
yes yes
ah
someone who traveled to norway told me that they could do basically everything with a cell phone buying food from a vending machine
paying the parking meter because it had all you credit card information
ah i thought they only had they only had people from the philadelphia area
hello my name is auria
okay
ah okay
more or less is like hat but exce with the exception that here it almost never snows but the cold comes in january and it stays until the middle of march
so spring starts but it doesn't last it lasts about three four weeks and then the heat
exactly
yes of course
i'm from puerto rico
yes and you
ah okay but i was born here i was born in north carolina i was raised there i moved to puerto rico at twelve years
and that was where i learned spanish
auria
i say about speaking spanish because i understoodunderstood because my parents spoke spanish but i always answered in english
so i exactly more or less at the age of fourteen also because at twelve years old i moved over there but i almost had thirteen years old
i refused myself not me not me wanted to know spanish i did not know nothing about puerto rico i was very rebel that they took me away from there
you know from my school about my friends
of course you know after a year of no having friends because nobody spoke spanish so i change my mind
north carolina
yeah
right
well only depends of the persons courtesy that use it
it is my opinion i don't believe that should be laws to tell you how you are suppose to use or not
nicole nice to meet you
just simple i believe that one person should have the courtesy to know that it is at the theatre should not use it if it is at the restaurant it should not be used
or at least excuse yourself and get out of the place
exactly
yes
but even if it was urgent you say that with permission
i'll get back in five minutes you go out outside answer the call and
and that's it but as you say people don't have that level of courtesy
the only law i think should exist is one about driving
because i've seen right in front of me a number of accidents that happen because the person is on the phone
they're on the highway and because they're on the phone they miss their stop their exit
good good and you
and then they do like a uturn to get to their exit and i've seen accidents happen because of that
at least have the earbud or earpiece as they say
if you are going to be in the car
yes
exactly
or because that is disrespect the moment you are with that person
exactly
i i am i agree with you because i believe that a lot of the technology though advance communication as you say at the same time we as a society have the habit
of getting out of the moment
you know with television with videos and what do i know with music
i am a little to the north of atlanta
well one doesn't live in this same moment and the telephone is often distracting at the moment as well and i sometimes refuse to answer the telephone
if i am playing with my little baby girl she's four years old she's only going to be four for one year more
you know and you'll never be able to return to this time
while the person who is calling well i can talk to him you know
exactly
exactly
exactly and when you don't
yeah it's true but it's the people like you say it's like a madness or something they always have to answer the phone when it rings
and it's a thing when they don't talk for even a minute but they have to answer the phone the moment it rings
but i don't i answer when i'm at the right moment that i know i am able to dedicate time to talk to the person but yes i
a hot but really beautiful where where are you from
i'm doing something cooking or reading a book to my girl well you know i let it ring
and then i call them back look mom sorry or soando sorry
exactly
yes i know
exactly
you assume that yes
no exactly but aha mom my mom is also a teacher and she goes through that a lot
she teaches spanish in high school also
oh esl
okay but my my daughter well she got unlucky with me because she is going to say that i'm like old fashion or i don't know what because she is not going to have a cellular
oh from new york
when she's twelve or thirteen years old she's not going to be going around with a cellular
oh yes but i i have seen that they are like twelve thirteen you know they are entering seventh eight grade and it seems that since they are
want to be older well they pressure their parents a lot and so their parents give it to them
and i don't believe in that
me when she's seventeen years old then i'll buy her the phone and
and that's to call call me
yes only one i'm a single mother
and so is the only one i have now
yes the same with the playstations and that i tell her no no no
has it started to be cold or not yet
and about how long does the fall start and the cold goes
hello
eh in october starts the otolo that is it feels like fall more her but the cold
the cold really starts in december january well the snow starts in january and the cold stays until april so
there's still a little bit left
um
ofcourse ofcourse same here spring is super short sometimes you notice the spring
cold and then the heat
listen and where are you
of puerto rico
i was born in new york but my family is cuban and i don't know also i lived in chile for a time and so my spanish is a mixture of things
mm
what's what's your name
yeah
of course me the same me my my fathers always speak english to me but my grandparents i was raise with my grandparents also because we lived together and my grandparents
they always spoke in spanish to me and i always answered in english and on i mean i started to really speak on about fourteen years
of course of course at that age how we felt
and where do you lived before living puerto rico
where in north carolina yes yes
hm well and the conversation the conversation that i listen was from cellular phones i don't know if over there because sometimes two conversations are from two different conversations i had conversations where the person listen to other thing
but i don't know what your opinion about the cellular phones without interuption
uhm
hm
auria hi i'm nicole
yes of course
sure sure that's obvious problem is there are some people who don't have that level of courtesy
i've been in movies where the phone rings in the restaurant where people have some i mean there are two people in a restaurant and one of them is on the phone
i mean yes if it's something urgent obviously but i don't understand what kind of urgency
it can't be that that urgent
sure
sure
hmm yes
hmm
hmm
nice to meet you how are you
hmm
um yes yes yes i agree absolutely i mean drivint
of course but having hands free because you really need to have free hands when you are driving i see people
walking on the street not paying attention because you are talking on the phone imagine driving it is much worse that you should have hands free at least
to drive and the other thing is in the hospitals that really you should not use phones in hospitals because the signals may interfere with the machines in the hospital
that you should have the phone turned off in other places it is i mean it is a matter of being aware of other people
and and also to be to be polite with people you are with because when you are with friends or with families answering the phone in the middle of a conversation it should be something important it shouldn't be
that you are with a friend talking on the phone with another friend you see
of course of course and the the phone is something that is supposed to improve communication
but i believe that worsens communication if you are interrupted always by calls
good where are you
of course of course
with computers
um
sure
but i don't answer it's like i'm with somebody except for when it's something important or if it's going to be a short call to agree on something else but if i am with somebody i really don't answer the phone
well i live by myself so i have time when i'm alone to talk on the phone alone
and i i believe that when i am other people you should be with that person what i mean is like it's not like before when there weren't any cell phones you only spoke over the phone at home and not in the street
well i don't know it's a little it's like a mania that people have to always be accessible and ready
also by email those people have those blackberries and they are always reachable by email to answer emails and i don't understand what could be so urgent about an email
that they wouldn't be able to answer it until you're back at home in front of a computer
i see and how is it there how is the weather
um
um yeah
um um
of course of course that makes sense besides now with the cellulars one can see who's calling like that is i don't know i mean if i'm going to see my friend
and my friend is calling me well i answer because i know we have to make plans for tomorrow
but if it's someone else i'll call them some other time i mean i think is a matter of having a little common sense but people think that always another thing is that the young people i'm a teacher the young people
love the cellular phones they always have them a cell phone always rings in the classroom i don't know how many times a cell phone rings in my classroom
and i say you're in school to learn not to be answering the phone
besides they are there with all their friends i don't know who's calling i mean one imagines they are in high school but one imagines that the majority of the
kids in high school their friends are also in the same school
eh i'm from new york
i mean because those phones that are calling are the parents calling i don't think so
um what does she teach your mom
oh okay okay i teach english english to the immigrants
esl so
no twelve of thirteen no is that my students many are already like seventeen eighteen they are pretty big
um um
yes yes
yes
and you only have one daughter
okay
yes and i'm in the city now
but well you are taking good care of her
no no cold i don't know it is warm right now it has been super humid but today is the first day that hasn't had that much humid
good evening how are you i'm from atlanta my name is norma
um well no i don't really agree because they keep talking and its kind of of dangerous they cant get distracted or get bad news
i know that they are in shock and they go and i know there are going to be some accidents because of that no
no but i mean on the other hand the other hand cellphones have become extremely necessary no for an emergency if something happens you sometimes can't reach a land line
you don't have one close but at least you have your cellphone with you
so what do you think about that
aha
aha
aha
sure
sure that should be that shouldn't be allowed i mean i agree that they should only be used for emergencies right
w meet each other again right
and there are none but when it's something for example at school what do kids need cell phones for
no they are going there to study they are not going there to speak to their friends they are going to study
no and ans when one is driving it's really dangerous that ones is you know eh driving and speaking on the phone
yes it's very because how you say it they don't pay attention no but sometimes it's sometimes it's convenient no but it has its advantages and disadvantages
sure
sure i mean that parents also are the ones that really as they say education starts at home no
the kids not even the parents educate them they don't get their kids used to good things good manners
or to do thing that are appropriate then
not even the children will not learn not understand
mhm
ha
hmh
ay my god
yeah
ah yes
yeah
ay yes yes the persons today
they are many times addicted to the cell phone
ah nothing happens they take their cell phone to see to find someone to talk to
of course
of course for certain things i say for emergencies no
oh yea
really eh many times you don't need it but many times there are no things that you really you no don't need for example earlier there weren't celu cellular phones that you
a few years ago there weren't cell phones there wasn't internet or something
there you were living well that nothing was lacking you weren't missing something
i don't know yes like we live in a consumer society then that's why
many times publicity all the marketing i don't know
it makes me think that we really need something yes we need it
mmm
yes in the train
of course now everyone has a cellphone everyone is woth their cellphone
talking with cellphone from here to there
mhm
no
mh
ah yes
of course he's a child uh huh
ah of course
of course yes when we go to the temple our temple also there
no there is uh people have their cellulars and before the conference begins there the the leader uh tells them to please turn off their cellulars so that they don't interrupt
yes some turn it off no but some still don't there they
have and sometimes makes noise no
oh yes really
sorry
hmm
oh okay
oh yes
oh that can be true
yes for some things no that is fine no
but too much addiction already is already too much
yes really
good every day she´s called but i did not call for nobody
yes me too of course i know but me no
i don't do they call me every day because you only have a number of calls you make
yeah yeah
they only can make twentyfive calls no more
i i guess so don't know ah because to me yes
they always call me every day from when the study began
yes they call me every day
and one day one day they did like two calls
right yesterday no one day i lost a call because no they called i wasn't there
here after that they didn't continue calling
mhm
ha
well
hey my name is gloria
and do you agree with the people that keep on talking
oh they call every day oh i'm glad
oh i'm glad i'm glad
oh also to me
aha
yes i lost too a few of them but i told that i was going to be here certain days sometime i'm not and sometime yes
and the machine they leave a message on the answering machine i lost that call hey they can call another time and they sometimes do
because i tell them i'm here late at night until eleven then they call late lots of time they call at night
aha
aha aha
i don't like them i don't follow i mean i talk i i i scream at people that are in the tour and talking on the phone i go ballistic
because they are not paying attention they are talking on the phone not paying attention in whether it did eat the light or if it didn't eat the light or
i mean they are arguing one day i was with a friend and her husband was arguing with her and i said hang up hang up you are going to make me mad you are going to try and kill me because you are now mad at him
and nowadays children are using it a school we have to take them away it really bothers us that kids bring their phones to school they loose them we have to look for them
we have to dial they go crazy like this was the last bill they had in their pockets ah and they don't respect they disrespect the teachers
teachers ask them to turn them off and they don't the put them on vibrate it's stupid really stupid specially in school
all those kids they loose the phones they loose them and we collect we gather around twenty to twenty five phones and we tell them not to bring them to school
oh good and you
but they don't care they still do it
they still bring them to school
exactly
exactly
aha
exactly
yes of course but yes yes but you know one day i told a mom you now that you shouldn't send him with his cell phone
ah but that's how i communicate with him and i told her look he can use the phone here in the office at any time he wants
if it's an emergency you call here and we look for him
she says no but you think that that that that i bought the cell phone so that he keeps it on top his dresser this and that i say look
ha i talked to the lady yesterday that dreamed about you she was from philadelphia
then i will tell the principal to start taking it away to take it away first thing because if if ones of the rules of the school is not to bring
that you don't bring cell phones he is not you can not send him with his cell phone you are guilty if they tell him off and they still don't tell them off they should tell them off
very hard so that they don't do it again
eh yes yes yes
aha
yeah
exactly yeah
eh let me see what else
i am telling you i had a party yesterday
and she called me to come later right then i could not find the place she kept calling me she called me like lets say fifteen
her name is silvia and we talked about the same thing we talked about the cellphone
times in less then three minutes
and i let the cell phone i will not let this this woman to cause me an accident
so i can get to her party in a hurry and anyway i was close to her home and she told me to go to the other side of town
yes after i was two blocks from her house she said no is on the other side and then i come again and say i will not listen to her
i am following the directions the directions that i have thru the internet
and got here the best i say next time i will not even call her because she was making me crazy with the dumb cellular
ay my god
yes yes yes
yes yes it is true it is true my husband my husband tells me ay always i am not going to buy you a new cell phone because you always leave it here
you believe you have to charge it as if it were your purse and i say i am not going to charge it like my purse because
yeah
i the my son is the most important thing to me and he is in school and if something happens to him they call me
and if something happens to you the ambulance calls me why am i going to have a cell phone if that when we say an accident once in the highway
you know then it comes in handy
yes yes yes
i know right
exactly
yes
yes
yes exactly and how do they do it the ipo us something else
each boy must have than music and listen it and all that oh my god and in the movie theater he said that we needed to talk
and do you remember about the cell phone
about if it's used in movies an the movie theater all start to talk and they ruin the movie if you go there
i stopped going there i'm tired to hear everyone in their cellphone also in the train in the train like it's
outside their house
you can hear all the conversation all the conversation of everyone near you the one in front of you
i don't like it i don't like also my own cellphone i put it in vibration and of somebody calls it must wait to
get out of the train i'm kind of crazy my friends tell me gloria you really have i say you go to the highway
you are going at 50 and talking and i don't think you can follow the conversation and the road i found it really wierd because when i
i don't get on the highway but when i do i can't talk to anyone
on the cellphone oh my god it drives me crazy that phone that cellphone drives me crazy
i know
we have to talk about the cell phone
i know i know i don't let my children to take it to school he has one only to emergencies
so he tells me mommy but it an emergency happens so i tell him you go and since i work at the school they let you call me
they already know that you are my son
they let you call me you know but we limit the telephone to the whole world so that the cellulars don't don't come and still
they don't listen and you tell them not to use them and they're in the hallway they go into the bathroom
in the hallway they go behind the door oh horrible horrible these kids of today oh my god horrible even in church in church today a poor woman
her cellular rang as if it were a bell and even the father when he was praying stopped and says what's that a door
and he did it like a joke
but and he did it like a joke so then he said that when one comes to church it's to pray not to ask the ringing cellular
so she felt bad and she went outside after when she went outside and the cellular began to ring again and and the whole world the whole world began to laugh
about cell phones
because this lady was already i said oh let her go already interrupting the concentration that you have in church you know so
uh huh
uh huh and people still don't turn it off right
some turn it off
i know what a lack of respect isn't it
like the adults don't pay attention that is why the children don't pay attention either
because they follow the role of their mom and dad you know i am so tired now i am i am helping my son with his homework
we are writing having breakfast home he has to write eight sentences about the cell that because he has a cell and he can live without a cell and he can use it at the cinema

because i can use it as a calculator and and and the other oh it has one good thing i put my appointment on the cell
and do you like them
yes the only bad thing is that if i then can not find the cell i don't remember forrell and i set it do it beeps me so that when it reminds me that

yes the one at the internet can be very useful y also can be very bad because like how you told there are good information and bad information also no
oh de pornography and all
yes
if so you have to be wise but
but how incredible is communicate with somebody or learn about anything
yes
and how you said the encyclopedia one can have access to so many things

and now this is how they got a recipe for empanadas of how many things it sticks and i get recipes

and to prepare and prepare
and the other one that would say that what was to know someone over the phone or the internet
oh ah yes we already talked about that no
yes
yes
how did you find out about this project
oh you should it is from that university no
eh no my husband co he participated in a project they'd had last year

and i sent it to him ah
ya
very fast
ah yes but he has yes
yes if i spoke with them i have them my commentary i said they have to at the least

yes
hi good evening i'm lorena
of using internet and in the end it says also give us your opinion and talk about that maybe we can start meeting other people by the mean we are in now
no yes yes it's yes yes
of course
yes me neither and finally i i under i don't understand that word
i i press four because i can understand that it's a no that it's a wire less telephone well wireless
i hope that that's it if not well total i've already passed the um test and i pa they communicate me and then hey and you have a lot of family in chile all of your family members
on the phone i've been very possitive i love it i never thought it was going to be so much fun
interesting well only three or four persons
but it really is like an adveture
from mexico from mexico city
and you
oh from chile chilean empanadas are yummy
sure
yeah in mexico city when my husband was doing his master
there was how was it called the academy of latin american social sciences
hi paulina how are you
there were students from all over latin america and then well there was always an occasion where his chilean or argentinian friend invited us to eat some dishes right
yes those empanadas how wonderful unforgettable
yes yes yes yes and where are you calling me from
from georgia i am in san antonio texas
and have you been here long
yes wow eleven years and about and and just two years
yes well well just starting starting our stay and you came here to study or how was it
hmm
wow how great how great that's good no
aha just two years because we were waiting for my children to finish their middle school as well
i was going to ask you the same because i can't hear it well i think that i no it wasn't clear i heard something about the internet
mhm in mexico they finished the secondary school and now they are here in high school
yes yes and
i have two now with me and one older who is studying the university she left the house earlier
and she has two years studying in pennsylvania
yes she is studying chemistry engineering
yes and very hardworking awesome well what are you studying
oh how nice is the microbiology i like it so much
yes yes yes i have studied social antropology and also english teacher
mhm and i was a teacher in mexico
but definitely the situation here about salaries is much more better and also i have some family here
about the
then we were good for san antonio
giving things yes yes yes yes and you already have the child
ohhh
yes yes yes then you're not working at the moment
clear and good to enjoy it
yes i'm listening to your advice for a good way to use the time
then how many people have you met this way
if the same thing happened to me two or three times
that is the call or not to enter the
and then no one is on the other side exactly
no no but but uh it wasn't clear uh if i was taking
ah okay
yes but this is interesting no i mean i didn't understand
at first and now that i've been talking it really is
one recovers the importance of talking no
because with this life always in a hurry and running around with so many things to do well sometimes one doesn't even phone one's friends to say hi and ask how they are right
then one has to value what's important
yes yes yes yes yes
but to dedicate a few minutes washing the dishes for example to make a phone call it's it's important
yeah yeah
yes
and i couldn't really hear it and even this is very difficult difficult
uhumm
yes and this good internet is another question because is a marvel
ehhm i'm not much but my childrens and specially the youngest is always attached
and the most important thing is that the computers are a marvel no
like how they facilitate the access to information
and poor paper encyclopedias became decorations articles
yes yes yes they are very nice
bad information no all that is known also of of
exactly what a terrible thing no yes yes yes yes
yes
and er i was connecting the dots before i took the call but the last i understood was about the advantages it said something like what have been the advanages
yes somebody in chile that you could send email or something whatever no
also those parents
yes yes yes you put yourself in and you but this well from a recipe from the kitchen until a medicine until a natural remedy
even physical microbiology whatever it is no
yes aha
aha exactly and it comes out easily true and i remember that
yes the other day for the pumpkin pie no during halloween
no man there was like thirty five different recipes
well to pick one and prepare it
yes and how is he
the most important dates for you in life i understand and which are the i don't know the least important and after that something about the internet that in your opinion
yes no through through this medium we have been learning phone calls and all
aha well yes i love it actually it has been novel it is incredible
what well this they are getting us back on the telephone it is useful and it is important no
to talk to people
my daughter at the university of pennsylvania
yes you too
aha
ah ok
that was good listen talking about that
the other day i had to talk to a man who lives in new york but whose parents are puerto rican
which are the advantages and disadvantages
how difficult to understand you ehh and you don't say that no no i haven't had any problem like we are speakng i say if not they eat the letters and change the words and
and they speak very fast what what work he says or the same man is the one that initiates the call no
no but certainly
that somebody who speaks good good in spanish
yes
yes
no yes yea or for example when it says to hold on the line
how you say i already forgot right now hold on
yes yes yes yes
well you're right in having done that i haven't told them i've only thought it
good night my name is and i live in connecticut
ah
the conversation is about internet do you use it internet
hmm
yeah yeah
hmm
yes it's good i lik i use it too to look for jobs to find information for my girl's schoolwork but for
things like looking for people on internet i don't like it
i don't believe in i think you can find there are many crazies a lot of garbage that they put online and
then it turns out it's not true there are lots of people who've used it and then gotten married but i i have never used
those chat rooms they talk about
oh miami ah and how are you baby
i've never chatted with anyone
wasn't that true
ajá ajá ajá
ajá ajá
and this this is also brought many problems to the couples i found
because has separate to many couples that the husbands are get to or women are get on the internet and met people and spend hour there and hours and hours and hours lost in there in the internet
i do not i do not used like that but my nice send me jokes of puerto rico and my son send me pictures of the baby the new baby that's why i liked very much the service
because i can see my granddaughter all the time and know how is all the months
ajá ajá
yes the picture is is something nice i love it but so eh i do not like it much that it was saying that you know that you send pictures and they keep them in a
good thanks and the baby sleeping
filed for a time and then after eof is i think is after six month or something like that is that like tha the delete la la
the program like delete it if you have not take it
ah well when i noy i do is that i don't let them in the computer i put them on a cd
and i put it the date and we put a a make a label then i have them if someone of the family come then we put them on the tv and the computer
ahhh ahh yes because if you leave them in the computer that takesnto many megabytes i think
ahh
mhm
ahhh
ahhh yeah
yes
she should be resting at least
yes you can but you have to i think that the cd program whatever to see it tv then you buy a cable i think that for the camera and
and and you have it on the tv that's what we do every time we have a party well we put it
in the cd then when the family comes you put it we get together and everyone sits in the living room and they see it on the tv you can see it nicer
because is also a bigger screen and if you put music to it
well they looks nicer that's why i like the internet but for the rest of of couple they don't get me
no but look all those kids that they sometimes kidnap that that meet these crazy men on the internet
here there was a girl that a guy seduced and from new jersey ah he was forty something and the girl was how old she was fifteen
and he took her luckily they were able to get her but god knows if he takes her and kills her and i don't like it too much either for the matter of the kids sometimes
is a separate room that you use as an office
mmh mmh
oh that's good
yeah
yes they when you go they changed the screen what do you do well my grandchildren sometimes i tell them what do you do no nothing here
and i open the screen they have to see
but you have to be watching them because the computer is a little it has lots advantages and also has its disadvantages
because look all that information that sometimes it gives you for those those terrorists to make bombs even the same students those who who killed those people at columbine school there are
they took the ideas from the i from the internet so sometimes i mean it has its its good side like everything like all they take that it has good things and then it has other points that well
are disastrous also
aha aha
yes now now well now they have invented so many things with parental control and all that that
that at least one well with that one can control them a little more than before but in beginning that there wasn't any of that well you know that they kids would get in in the chat rooms ehm they would open twenty thousand things
good i was watching i was watching a show here on the tv that i like to watch on wednesdays
hmm
oh it is it is people that ehm when y i think that if you leave the the password and don't close the when you go to look at your mail
if you don't close well the quickly the oor let's suppose you you go to cook or to do something and you leave it there an open space
many there are many men that many people that know how to get your get your password at that moment that you have left it there for for for a long time that's why it says that as soon
you are going to leave the computer well you take and close it do you understand me to ensure that nobody can take your information well then they what they do that when they already take your password they come and start to send
t these emails that that sometimes what they bring are viruses sometimes what they brins are drity things
so it all depends on that is at least one must be very careful with the with the passwords and with the information especially the banking one and all of that
when sometimes they request information that you that they tell you to enter your pin again because
there one has to be very careful
aha
oh i've got allergies but aside from that well i've taken vitamins to get rid of it
oh yes well that is the the identity theft well that is being used much now in
with the help of internet they steal you all of your personal info that's why whenever you know sometime they tell you that you get what do i know free stuff and they offer you thousand free things on internet and you start filling all that and then
when they start asking things like mothers name birth date and all that then it's not ok to put all that info
oh
no
hello
but
anyway i don´t
i do that's like my i use it every day we uh you know we have email we have uh we do everything we need to do with the bank
i look for information recipes go to the library
i don't buy a lot but if we're going to buy something i always do uh research
eh looking for the products seeing where i can get the best price so for us internet is like you know having a
encyclopedia if i may put it this way
at home
no me neither
well i
this is annie from miami we've talked before
yes eh and
i used eh get into into the chat rooms but weren't of you know for looking people or wherever were of diferet topics
but no it wasn't anything eh you know after a while i didn't liked because the people i don't know saying things like that
that
yes or or that normaly doesn't say you know as it got rough
and i didn't liked at all so after a while as one of two months y let go but because i prefer talk with people not you know
be there in front of a machine
but you know i have one
yes
yes that is something that we do too we take pictures of the child and we send to all the friends and to all well now not every month but it was every months before
goo and you
and i like a lot because so at least the people that we know the family that is away from us they can see how she is growing
yes that is something that we do a lot i forgot the pictures
well with us mine girl has almost 2 years old and never never with had that the pictures still there is that depends you know
of what arenyou using but we had pictures still in the internet of of since when my babyshower
ah well ahhh
ah that is good that is a good idea
well i always make copies before i put them in the compuert
oh sorry in the internet i always make a copy and all that
them this is i had the originals that took we take about one hundred and fifty each month
but nothing else i put in the internet let say thirty or forty then i keep the originals and i put them in the internet because the ones in the internet are the
she's fine yes thank god
you know fix you know the best i always have 2 2types from the cd then when she grows if she wants all the pictures i can put them look these are the best and these are the originals what ever you want
she has them but
i had never thought of putting it on the on the tv
yes
mm eh yes that's a good idea
yes
me neither and and also like what you said before that you know you never know who you are going to meet
yes
neither yes that is something that that i already know that when you know my kid is more let's say older that the computer will
i will have to change it from the room is in because right now we have it like in not in the office but let's say that's what we are calling it
yes now that i put her to bed
and
yes but i want to put it let's say in the living room or you know some place where when they are they are using it i can see
everything they are doing because since i used to be a teacher before i know you know what kids do
like they hid from the parents and things like that and not that
i don't want to say that my
yes it is
so
ah
yes
it all depends on how it is used you know yes that but no i i i love internet but i also know that when
and you how are you
you know if you start to no if you start but when children start using it it has to be a bit different
you know because i believe that many times they don't
yes
well and and still that that happens even though i have the parental controls because many times when i go to to search my email you know and i know that this would happen to to some of my students that they go to open the email
and picture of you know of of nude women come out whatever
and and that is something that that bothers me a lot that i don't know how is it that you can change that you know
yes
yes
no thank god us you know things like that over the computer no they have not happened but if somebody if they stole the teh number of of
social security
oh that's great i feel like i've got a cold i have a really bad sore throat
of my husband a few years ago and we had a many problems
why
that's what they say but but since i'm pregnant i can't take many things
and that's how i am you know i'm just not feeling that well today
hello good evening i'm nicole i'm speaking from new york
of telesales i don't like it i don't know who likes it
those people who call to sell anything uh i don't know
uh no i think they are talking about when they call you
when they call on the phone they sell questions and also when
when they send emails
of course they're selling spam
as if i don't know i don't know if this convinces anyone i have never never bought anything i saw in any email like that seriously
i don't know
yes i uh bought things on the internet but not
of course
hello how are you
of course of course well it should be it should be effective
it must be that someone sees those emails and is convinced because if not
um
sure
mhm right
i don't know if you've tried to use those lists that say they don't call
like you can sign up for a list and with that it's not supposed to call you or they stop calling you but i'm not sure
i'm signed up and they still call me sometimes
but not as much not as much as before
um yes but i always say i can not talk right now and hang up because i do not want to listen to the whole story that they're going to tell me because i know that i am not going to
fine fine have we spoken before or no
i'm not going to buy anything
hmm
yes yes yes alsu
yes
yes it must be a terrible job to have that job my sister did it for about a week
and she would get home crying every day because everybody
sure no nobody wants to listen to you i mean
i mean everybody hangs up on you and she would arrive like that so affected that she stopped working like that in one week
no and on top of that they procure you when one has a job like that they preccure you oh
oh to have sales i mean they are like like listening to you while you are making the call the bosses are listening to you
no no i spoke to someone from atlanta
to se how you are selling and if you are not
sure and if you are not very efficient they kick you out or they pay you less that is how it is bad for work sometimes i fell a little sympathy for people
sure sure like like they too are trying to make their money but i do not want to give them money that is the problem
ehm i don't know but what it is is that i answer the surveys i mea if if they call me with surveys so that he wants to know
that i am going to vote and for whom am i goint to vote i don't know what i think about the political cituation now that i do answer on the surveys
i think that it is good ehm that they have one i mean diverse opinions
and i like to contribute with something like that because it is like for investigations or for
sure but they are not asking me for money just answers i give opinions but not dough ehm
sure sure no besides i do not want what they are selling me the newspaper i do not want that is i mean that is i read the news over the internet
and i don't want newspapers in my house
but i don't know
ehm and i don't know what else what else they sell life insurance i do not want it
hmm that you won a car
you just have to go to miami and look for it
sure
sure not in most things
they are all making money but if it wasn't for that they would not be making money
someone has to pay for these peoples salaries
uhm sure another thing is that sometimes
they call you and say they have leaving a message saying to such a number to claim your prize
and the number turns out to be one that charges money for dialing it
what country are you from
in other words is like a nine hundred number a nine hundred that charges you for calling so that
uhm
i think it's cheap i mean i think it's very cheap of that company to do that kind of advertising i mean they probably pay very little
to to the people that's calling
in fact sometimes that people that's calling isn't even here in the united states
but they have like communication systems
that allow people to be calling you from india
and you can't tell since they speak english in india
i mean they do like outsourcing
like they pay people in those countries to to call you to sell you stuff can you imagine
ah okay eh
how little they must be paying those people
they're making calls so if they make one or two sales for each person maybe they're making profit right i mean they do it for that because they can't
i mean they must not be selling a lot like that but since they don't pay much to their employees they must make very little profit of that
sure as it is a very poor country
um i hear that once that that when like help desk when you have a problem with your computer or something like that and you call for help that many times the person that answers is in india
mhm
sure sometimes the communication is very bad
sure or sometimes it's as if there is a delay like you hear and don't hear
what happens to those communications if i'm calling the phone company and the connection is bad but it's that they're far that's incredible
incredible to think of that because even they're in another time zone there must be twelve hours of difference with india
i well my family is cuban
sure or or they work at night
that people must call much more during the day than during the night here so those people must be calling at night i say that is working at night over there
i mean if it's three in the afternoon here
good i don't know i don't know em maybe i don't know or maybe it's worth it for that people maybe they are better than the other jobs there
right it's a little talk about this topic sometimes the topics he gives
there is not much to day
yes
to set up the dates because they translate from english
it is a machine that is translating from english to spanish
to set up dates i also i was listening to set up dates what would setting up dates mean
eh but i was born here in the united states
and after dating in english date should be dating to date
what what an oversight a study of language
it is supposed that this is a linguistic study
and they can't translate the words well into spanish
hello good evening
ah okay and then what's your opinion of the nol
yes
no you are you are referring to to you are referring to telemarketing seems to be popups on the internet or that that call on the telephone
ah when they call on the phone
ah
ah spam yes
aha
yes
ah me neither i don't think what that i have bought hings on the internet online
but not from what they send in spam
i'm norma here from atlanta georgia
no no other things that one really needs no
no and
yeah sure surely there are people who invest in it so for example they don't send all those emails and
and the small companies or i don't know who does that then your money is invested
right and with the telephone it's really annoying especially when you're busy
yeah annoying
uh huh
yes of course
mhm yeah sure sometimes the telemarketers are so insistent
uh huh
fine and you
of course i am not interested
yes sometimes there are people and sometimes there are what do they call it scams they call them that sell you something and there are times when at the end it wasn't true that alsu happens
they offer counterfeit things
they offer to sell over the phone even over the internet also
oh yes yes many family members that were employed there
nobody wanted to buy
yes not even listen
of course really they are a job very it is not very no no worth it that much it will be harder to swallow
sure
yes
um i don't know
to they pay you per commission for sure
yes sometimes one things well it is a job that they are doing just like any other job no
hmm hmm
aha
hmm
sure
mm like research
sure because now you never know who it really is no truthful who is lying
yes
insurance vacations
aha yes
that's it that is really
or yes you won this but you have to send money to ensure your prize
is quite a matter
uhm
sure
yes we really have to be careful and not
no
yes
uhm
ah in addition to this you have to pay the long distance call besides that you have to be very careful no award lots prizes to many people to get more business
mm
no that's a way a way of advertising they say
yes
oh yeah yeah that's true
uh um
oh yeah right
yeah their accent
right
uh
right because in india they don't pay much for that
of course because in in india it's a completely different way of life and there you pay you pay less to people
i i am peruvian
aha so these people are anxious to work in whatever job no
yes yes it's true even eh here they big ones for example the telecommunications company here in the south bell south
no and always sometimes my husband calls i he calls for some problem with the phone with the internet we have and yes yes the people that you call that answer are in idia
no yes mhm sure and one sometimes they don't understand because they don't speak
mhm mhm
sure now yes
i suppose that there must be people that work what do i know all the time no
or they work yes they work at night
yes more or less mhm
right well what else should we say so the twelve minutes are over
and you
mhm
clearly like the last time they called for that about the dates
that they call in order to set up the dates
yes it is a
it is a question not a question i said what is to make dates i don't understand very well
yes
yes instead of dating
ah yes
clearly
clearly clearly that is not that best that it doesn't give the complete translation or the appropriate translation
aha
hello good afternoon

ah i a we if we take we are lactovegetarian
no yes it's that there are so many things that you can ve e eat being vegetarian really i say well now that i am vegetarian you like

i'm with the kids here at home well they're gone now
uhm here i am norma from atlanta georgia
they left me here alone to rest
i have two two little men who are
two men
and should not be imagined as not men are always more active
ah you
oh and are they not married
ah aha
ah okay
ah is that where the truth is
ah you see i am forty one
fine and you we talked yesterday right
mm
does not appear the right person
mhm
mhm
mhm
yes yet you're young
if so when you get married and it's different
no and there are more obligations
it's not the same freedom as before especially if you have children
mhm
oh okay oh yes yes
clearly that if that is true but stop or at least not now i have this determination
no next to a little more of its or to deny a little more of his freedom i suppose that it must be like that no
yes
hmjm
uhm
oh that sure is true you are right in that
when the the children are little are babies and no way one does not have time for even ea not even eat nor even bathe
aha
oh yes a small baby
sure with small babies it is like that exactly hmjm
yes yes i think that we did talk
well yes that is true when children are small babies one has to be with them the whole time
um my kids are seven and the other one is three
yeah they're still small
they're kids right so
mhm
of course of course enjoy while you can
of course otherwise one would
yeah yeah he is american he is african american
i got married he just lives in the temple
we have the same religion so we got married there
aha
oh i'm from the'movimiento hare krishna'
i don't know if it has if it would have heard
mhm
mhm yes yes a we're vegetarians there aren't
uh yes yes there quite a few temples in peru in and around the world there are a lot of temples
ah certainly of course
and they have been vegetarians since the womb
nope no it's the
up until now no so when they young no they are and even though we didn't teach them to be vegetarians
if not they don't ask nor do they have any sort of inclination of course when they become teenagers and well when they begin to to what do i know to ask about or something and and it's well nobody can force them to do something that they don't want to do right it's a question they have to answer for themselves
aha
they have they're not children they have free will as they grow older and
no they have to choose or see
oh yes hmmm
hmmm
ah
ah yes
yeah
when you have big meals
hmm
sure it's it's healthier no
yes that is what i was thinking
is healthier and in fact your digestion is better
mm
no no we don't eat meat eggs or fish
no and are you still with the same boyfriend
ah good now suddenly the other the other boyfriend there suggest it to him he's not inclined to eat meat and you make him a vegetarian is easier you're a vegetarian
mm
aha
aha
aha
aha
sure because i don't and i don't think that somebody is going to be much in agreeance with the telesale
and well some people are more inclined to well it's a custom they were born and raised like that right
they were raised eating meat and that there is not an alternative and then they listened something but it's nothing they would ever have imagine right
as a vegetarian i really don't have anything to envy people who eats meat i have been a vegetarian for 20 years
and you really feel really healthy and you even appear to have the age you have
if you are vegetarian
no but it's different yes
of course because it's really hard for human digestion the human body is not made for eating meat it's not meant to eat meat
yes because is not until you become a vegetarian that you learn how to balance your food
of course you have to start looking for the proteins that you won't find in
find in meat like
hello
no uh you are peruvian
yes
mmm
of course milk and yogurt and all that
that i see i see
sure sure it's like you get used to it and that's it
sure no i like i like i also like very much i like very much indian food that has many vegetarian things and the
asian food in general i like it a lot
chinese food japanese food but well that one i do like i like fish that's it
but yes eh what were you going to ask me i had another question but i forgot it oh and do your children speak spanish and english or
sure sure because with your husband they speak in they speak in english
oh right and how how long have you been living here
mm
mm
ten years and do you have family here or
right
oh ok

i do not know how they are
no no not yet
and i live i live alone but about my parents
mm
i am twenty seven years old
hello how are you
if not me me or my family would love to have a marriage and be a family but
i do not know so far no
no i do not know my boyfriend as well or perhaps get along
but it takes a year that is we met a year ago
so we're expecting it a little
but maybe i certainly hope so
yes we are
clearly
clearly
of course i like to not live alone sometimes if only slightly as i like to go out do things
no yesterday not because yesterday i did not make any phone calls but we talked before
see other people because if not it's like but not too lonely all at the time i think
sure
sure because because it is a lot more work and when one has a family it is already a lot of work
and i i like to be alone like how should i say it i like i like tranquility i like it like thinking and reading
i think that when when i have children
wow it will be very difficult to do those things
so that
sure sure i went to visit a friend that has a daughter
the daughter has has about six weeks
i mean very little and i don't know my friend always with the with the baby i mean she doesn't leave her
but about this topic i don't recall no maybe about this same topic about the telesale
i mean she is with her atevery moment yes but no she she is very happy but it is a huge responsibility until they have grown a little
mm and how old are your kids
oh ok
of course of course um
its great having kids like having a family i think that's the best thing in this world
i don't know in a few years i'm just gon na relax im gon na relax all the time
of course
and your husband did you meet him in the united states
oh ok
ha
yes we talked i think it was on friday
oh ok and what religion is he
ah yes look yes
yes i studied at the at the university i studied buddhism
it's like it's similar right
and are there hari krishna in peru also should be
mm and it and the children are also vegetarians right
there are
and they never ask to eat meat or anything like that
really
sure
we talked about this same topic how stupid
sure mm
sure sure
yes i was a vegetarian for many years
i had been a vegetarian for like ten years but then i went to chile i was living with a boyfriend there and it was really hard to keep being a vegetarian because
because he he ate meat and if i cooked vegetarian stuff
and he placed like a piece of meat in there like i didn't want to eat like that
so i stopped i stopped because it was like too complicated and then then when i came back i kept at it but i don't eat too much meat
i never cook meat at home i just
sure if i eat out or if i go to someone else's house and they cook something then yes but at home only vegetables and i don't know legumes
i like hmm i prefer to eat like that
what else are we going to say
i mean
hmm
mm yes the truth is that no i don't like meat too much i like fish
i don't know you guys eat fish or no
no fish not really but the meat in reality no it doesn't appeal to me too much
no we broke up
yes i've never been in a relationship with someone who's a vegetarian never
and and i've had like five boyfriends
like serious boyfriends
i mean more or less serious
well let's talk about something else because what are we going to say we are not going to have the same conversation as before
but they all ate meat and they really liked meat in fact even the one i have now also
he likes hamburgers and chicken
of course
mmm
mmm
of course
yes i like ti because
meat makes me feel really full really heavy
but people is used to eat meat they don't feel full if they don't eat meat
yes you have to be careful to eat proteins
hello how are you what do you want to speak about i didn't understand the
you know i'm in a list in which i don't know if you know about this but there's a list in which you can put your name in and
with the government and them they cant call you like that yes i think they still have that list and i don't know where
they can send it to me but they can't call me
no calling list it started around two two and a half years ago when the government started using that list because people were speaking complaining
that they would call when they were sleeping or at certain hours during the day and all that do you understand so i included my number in that list
no not to request no but if i don't pay my bills they do call me
yes yes but if i don't pay my bills they do call and also they send it through the mail the mail they are doing all sorts of things
and i don't know if you have a computer or if you get that type of info through the computer
aha
mm
aha no on the phone you have to get another phone because i can't get the volume up in my phone i need to turn it up
and where are you from you said that you've been living here in the united states for how long
a year wow what country are you from ah you are spanish aha yes because i'm from latin american hispanic
yes but in panama in panama is very commercial a very small country understand
yes yes but panama is much more developed than costa rica yes yes there's a lot
oh yes
yes yes well costa rica is the most democratic country in the american continent yes eh
it doesn't have an army and all its politic the politic in costa rica is the most peaceful of all
i'm telling you the truth a map there near the united states there they have different parties and each party one year you are in power or two or three years you are in power and then another party and they do it perfectly
without an army or anything like that that the government needs to use force understand
ah but many people don't know it but in panama we have more businesses more developed
ah i heard you but i can't hear what the machine was saying
because of the panama canal and see there are people there from all parts of the world in panama there are people from all parts of the world there are many people that go there
working in ships right with big ships they are called junk ship and the ship right if they wanted to stay they would go and stay in panama
and they wouldn't go back to their countries so lots of people weren't able to leave they had political conflicts back home and when they would get there when they work int he ships they
they would get to panama you know and they would flee the ship and just mix with the people from panama and
ah like three thousand the whole country must be around three thousand
yes it's a small country but they have good businesses developing there businesses yes
yes tiny just three thousand three thousand people there but not i mean three million not three thousand three million oh oh oh i mean three million i'm sorry
three million three million no no that's it three million people not three thousand a friend of mine was here in brooklyn right new york and i was at a library with business books
a library with business books and i noticed the yellow pages books from spain and you know do you know what the yellow books are a yellow book is a phone list with phone numbers from bussinesses
the yellow right the yellow one from spain and it wasn't as big as the one from brooklyn and brooklyn is such a tiny part of the united states do you understand new york city has five boroughs right
yes yes well she speaks spanish with an american accent do you understand
brooklyn is one of those boroughs and the whole pages for spain weren't as
yes yes about thirty years but but if i have over thirty years here yes yes i have been here many years and i am more americanized than latino
very good as well the thing that depends on the person and
the education and that the people that you are with the whole time understand because if you have gone to college or something like that you still continue talking a certain way understand because i am going to tell you the truth
oh i have a profressor a teacher here of right i went to brooklyn college she was the a teacher of a teacher of of spanish of spanish teaching
but the class with her was on spanish literature understand like don quixote lazarillo de torme and all of that
and i don't remember now lazarillo de torme the first the first picarezque novel
the thing is that she was the worst teacher i have ever had in my whole life and she learned spanish from the book no by speaking in her home
like the machine the machine that you heard but she speaks it better than the machine you see but she knew spanish very good is that she had to study so much in spain that when the moors had undertaking and all of that
she hab to visit certain how do they call it in new york we have a museum right
well it's because there are many words in spanish and not just words but the
where they teach a lot about spanish architecture see and the influences that the moors have had oh in spain's influence there is and we have certain words like the word ojala that is arabic yes
yeah because when they say i tell you i wish we go to the movies tomorros and something like that the movie right
i wish but what i'm saying to you is oh allah the god allah understands but that's a different thing but speaking about all that telemarketing and spam you say you don't get a lot huh
no no of email right oh please oh believe me i get it by i have yahoo which do you have
oh please
and not not only horrible but those people they're very how do you say in english right i'm saying i'm practically telling you ok they're very how do you say it creative
they know how to write things that you'll want to read
or that says things you want to see what's inside i'm telling you they're very how do you say uh
imagination yes their imagination they're very
right
from many different countries different regions speak in a certain way and name things in a certain way like i'm here in new york and i was talking to
oh oh millions oh oh oh
ah no oh and look those have increased a lot in the last six months ah
the former has been raised much that tells you that i earned some in england and i have to go to england to claim my thousand pesos or dollars what they have and that oh leave that
but they tell it yes yes
but look they send a lot of them they send it from another country and they send like two thousand right two millions
and they expect for one or two people you understand
yes it is incredible that they say one of them say that if some mister has like fifty thousand pesos if i do not answer
fifty thousand fifty millions and do not ans and i don't they are crazy and they are from many countries and they say many of them are from nigeria nigeria and eh eh
aham
oh
someone from puerto rico and they name the oranges
but the thing eh i do not believe that the government can how could they they can not know who the person that is sending is who or what is doing that
yes and the thing is that when they send all that letters yes eh it is difficult when well it says eh well you know that what they are trying to achieve their guys you understand the money but
china yes i'd never understand that because china is to me a person that comes from china
a woman but it's how they speak spanish it's something like oh okay lets speak about telemarketing right
hello fine fine i'm laya
aha ahhhh
it is legally valid you can't be sent unwanted publicity
ah they can't call you okay okay aha aha
aha aha
and they don't call you it really works aha okay

idioms yes yes yes aha yes yes yes

and that asks help to take out these millions and that in addition i mean
yes yes yes yes
ah yes yes too yes yes i am wondering if someone really believes those stories no
because i don't know it looks incredible that someone could take the bait thus if they send them is because i don't know somebody would take the bait
yes yes yeah sure
yes yes yes nowadays it does not take any effort to send an email to millions of people just to say but i don't know it seems incredible to me that someone can take the bait
yes yes yes yes yes such stories some very impressive stories
yes yes yes from nigeria and futhermore as i am in the university we organize conferences
then there is people that registers for the conference and after that they ask for money to come with well complicated stories that sometimes you do not know if people is true or false i mean with all that from the internet
mja china
sometimes you do not know if if you are talking with someone real of if they are deceiving you completely is
ah yes it is hard because it is so easy to hide the identity not that

oh
yeah true
yeah
yeah
yeah
hello
ah i see what part of new your
um
in what part of new york
ah in
yes
yes
i don't like it
and you uh
yes me neither me neither i think it's always an inconvenience i mean more than anything
yes it must be i mean they must make money with that because otherwise they wouldn't do it
i mean
hello
um
excuse me
mmm
no no it must be someone sometimes i think people who is lonely maybe elderly citizens if they are alone
they like to chat
you could start a conversation sometimes elderly people might be a little confused it might
they might be easily convinced
but i think that most of the younger people l don't know there must be young people who might be convinced i think that busy people don't want to lose time in
in having a conversation like that one
in my email all the spam is in a separate carpet
hey i am nicole i´m form new york
email automatically does that
that way i don't even see those emails i don't check that carpet it's always there and the site eliminates everything after 30 days or something like that
almost never sometimes yes sometimes i go and see but and because they arrive in hundreds or rather for example now there must be like twohundred and fifty and i get bored looking at it
um yes
maybe in the spam
of course
yes
that's great that's great what services do you use
what email do you use
umh yes well i never open the spam emails but look through the list like to see if someone if another person has called but no
nicole and you
umh i do not open them because i believe
um yes
yes that's what they say of course i don't know it that really happens i think you have to open the email and also open the attachment like a
a file you have to open also something they send along with the email
because i don't think you can send a virus like that by simply sending the email
oh that's better
um
yes yes
yes they are selling and also like pornographic things
i don't know pills
nicole
hu
uh
well there must be people i don't know i think there are people who allow themselves to be convinced by those things they allow
i don't know i know a woman that yes there are some emails that talk about someone i don't know like emails that say that someone in the government
needs help and if you send them money they'll give you back ten times more something like that and i know a woman
yes i mean she always believes it and she she's not well i think she's a little crazy or something but she always believes it
she always believes it and she's lost a bunch of money
yes yes that's right i mean when you sell something many people won't buy but if they say
if they say you're going to make money i mean if they tell you that if you send money they'll send you more i think many people dream about that
like that
nicole nicole no it is not a spanish name
sure sure but there are always people who think they are
they are the only ones in the world who'll make money with that i mean there are people who want to dream about that
it's like like gambling i mean there are people who gamble and think they're going to make a lot of money even though everyone loses money with gambling
sure sure but there are always people who gamble and think they'll get rich
and well well while betting you can get some money there has to be some but only a few
of course
of course or poker as well just a bit right
yeah in poker i think its like
poker is a physiological game because nobody knows how much somebody has no one knows
its a game like
what is your name
of course um
of course no no this is like
of course
ha look
ha
look
but i think is good to have some people win because we always lose money some that win must exist
um
yes and i'm registered
same sometimes they call butt not much like few times than before and is delayed a little before it starts working like a few months
pilar and where are you from
and from there it shows they tell you we will put you on the list and the list start three months from now
but from there you can realize they have fewer calls
equal you always have people that call don't know but
um
um
um
clearly
yes yes i believe that no not all the companies that
they pay attention to the list or perhaps i don't know perhaps not all of them have the list i don't know who gets the list
it's less this way i don't know if you have put your name here but your number here
ha i see hey and where are you now
but they still call
um
how nice
um
um
um hu
yes yes
right
right
um right
hello
yes um
ah in what part of madrid eh oh in manhattan
but well we need to talk we're deviating and they're not going to pay us the topic is telemarketing no
and what do you think
when they call you on the phone to try to sell you something
not at all of course
i don't know anybody that that that likes it in fact i don't know anyone that has ever bought anything by by phone
but well i think that some someone must buy from them because otherwise
yes of course but they could earn very little because i
i have never hear anyone that's not bothered by it i even think it hurts them more
hello what´s your name
because it's like negative publicity for them
because if you are getting called at your house with prank calls
well people isn't giving a good opinion basically they don't
yes i see
they might be convinced to buy something
yes unfortunately
of course and spam always
of course
it's less annoying
and you never check if
what´s your name
i i if i look at it every time i look at at my spam email because what has happened in the past is that i got emails that were not spam
it has gone to the spam folder most people do not look at it and it has happened to me that i write to someone
and they never answer me and they never answer me
and it was because it went to their spam folder and they never looked at it before erasing it do you know what i mean
i always look at it but very rarely almost always in the is fine almost all the time spam is sent to the spam folder
and nothing of spam arrives at my inbox folder
what
i have many i have yahoo and hotmail i have many and yes they are fine because because the spam is very protected no virus can get in
no but yes but even sometimes you can get emails from people that you know with virus
and that does not let you open them that's fine
ni ni
the one
yes
no you have to download the whole file but that's what hotmail doesn't let you do it doesn't let you download the file
because the truth is there are a lot of tricks those emails with viruses and many times it seems as if as if a person that you know is sending you something that interest you
and is is a virus in other words you have to be very careful and the ones that send ads through the internet in other words those that send spam are really selling things
i is that i don't understand that who buys them
yes is almost always
yes everything that's illegal they sell that way
eh pills that are not approved that promise miracles and people believe it is that i don't understand
who believes that
nico nico i don´t understand but it´s not spanish
yes sure
yes she fell for that
it's very dangerous that's very dangerous because many people have lost a lot of money like that
yes yes there are people who fall for that
i think it's lack of of intelligence that's not thinking really because they're going to give me money for free and how is it that i alone got the mail with so many people in the world who also have email
yes
sure
yes practically otherwise the bank the casino wouldn't exist
yeah
they go so they can have fun for a day they go because there is no addition and they have to play and some professionally dedicate themselves because there are games like black jack
i am pilar
you have good probabilities if you play the game properly
what i don't know
i think it goes with it i suppose
well in poker i know i saw a documentary about the people from mit that had tricks to count their cards that is illegal of course the casino is ready for it you cant go against the casino
its not really a trick a trick would be to mark the cards with something
cards in your sleeve but if your are capable of counting the cards why would it be a trick so when it came from casino to casino they would find out
winning little by little not winning a lot at every casino but to have attention by other people otherwise it would be prohibited to enter casinos
they had to go europe to win at casinos in europe
was curious
but but no one is
pil pilar
obviously no one gives money the world wants believe
is is very strange that someone can give away something very strange they always search something in return and the lists you put your number
and it works
good
the bad thing about the list is not mandatory like if you put your phone on that list they probably will not call you
but it isn't simply a list for the not wanting the trouble to call the people
you already told them not to call you because is a waste of time and money
but yes there are other companies that do not care y in case they try it anyways
it is them that do not watch the lists y who call you and make you lose equal time
and they lose money
i am from spain

i know yes
not a single one calls me i am lucky my phone was new
i put nothing more january i put it on the list and the calls that i've received are from services of companies with which i have some kind of service
they still want to sell me more services
so this is also very annoying
but the next time is that they called from the same bank
they called me various time for the same reason i will tell them to put me on the list
to not call
i say they must have a list like that because i'm a client and yes
i am in new york
if a client tells them not to call anymore the must be real stupid to keep doing it because the client could get irritated and go
and that way i will try see if they don't call me again those heavy guys from the bank because they always want to sell me the same thing and i already told them no
hey think one day i will say yes or what i don't get it
hello
yes
i still think the same thing some i like some i don't like so here all the time all the time they come in the mail yesterday three came
again over refinancing my home i say so those people don't leave you alone
yes
yes that is is the truth too much the truth
mmhm i always check them
yes because mm good there's some how do you say you can find something good yes see but over the phone i don't like that
yes
and sometimes they call me very early supposedly they can't call you until after eight they call me before eight but i don't answer
yes i notice
is tammy
yes i notice the caller id depending if i don't know who it is i wake until the recording takes it if i recognize the voice then i take it
sometimes yes sometimes if a get the phone and i say ah i already know who it is and say no thanks no thanks oh sometimes a pretend that i don't speak english
so that they leave me alone i don't speak english that
in english
no they never called in spanish only english
yes around here no they didn't start like that already good that is what i have to say
no we have plenty around
has something to do because around here there are plenty the thing is plenty of mexicans around
you don't have many you have panama people but i don't know to much of them and
no no they didn't call me or others from what i know i didn't get any others maybe
alex is back how are you
indeed yes
i got into my in my email and have ninety seven
aha
yes is true
too much the send you too much of everything things that you have not asked for yesterday my husband was laughing about a mail he received about nudist beaches and i did was laughing
very mad he said where where are they from and i was laughing
it made me laughed because he had all the letters in the hand but that one if you see the envelope i don´t know it does not say what it is
he had it in the jacket because he didn´t want anybody to see it i said who is going to see it who is going to look in your things i was laughing
you why do you always send me that i say i don´t know i don´t know
aha
i don't think many people are doing this survey
ah
that is good aha
but we have to be careful when we get involved
mm
aha
ay mm
i remember when i went to see my lawyer the girl that works in the office the secretary was crying and i said why are you crying she told me no that
one this telemarketing people took five hundred dollar from my account
first it was one hundred fifty the other and was fighting so the lawyer she was working for was going o help her
no people don't think about that
because i have spoken to you three or four times
i when i buy buy things online my husband and i have a special bank account in which we deposit only the money we are going to use online
so if we are going to spend sixty dollars that's what i deposit and i use the card and that's it
what
exactly me also
i heard about that in the news that a few government individuals had been catched in a city in africa
were mmmm
ahh
yes same to me
yes we that people i don't believe of my bank acount no no no no i got calls even from canada stating to buy
lotterry tickets
and another person two or three no i think if we talk about after you say i think if
in canada i said for what if i didn't buy lottery tickets here i get them here and there why i am going to buy lotteries tickets from canada
no why no yes you will be rich no no thank you
yes a a card was sent to my son's fiance that said that she won a pair of earings
diamond and a wacth money and she has to send them around two hundred and fifty dollars in order to receive her prize
and she says to me because she only is eighteen years old i tell her don´t go crazy to not be sent anything
yes
yes
yes
sure yes
yes
eh no it's not your fault that they don't have enough people to do this survey
yes because any person there are persons that are such a sort that it is easy for them to put things there when they say there is something free i tell you when it is free
yes my husband always tells me that when there is something like that read everything the the fine print at the bottom read it well well because it can take you in with something from which you have to pay something
well it is tough after you sign to get yourself out of something
that´s why that they have to i always tell this to my sister and my kids
read everything yes i have not received anything in spanish yet
i say with me people don't even think that i am latin when they see me so i also pretend so the ones that are on that dis that now that you have dis that the the
that you can also call to have your phone removed that they remove you from marketing that also is good
but i don't know i don't know i probably can ask my husband what he knows because he says that is is free you put in your phone number and your name and they removed you from
from the list that they have because there are some that you tell them and they continue calling
because
laugh
because they buy the names the list with names
and sometimes they go like one time they told me that they go like that with every number from one two three four fice they don't they don't know my phone number but
they go exactly almost one two three four five they dial the numbers directly like that
so that is is easy for them to not loose any of them because they are doing in in order
hmm
and today i almost do it early and could not so i say i'll call later and i forget and suddenly
hello
i always call at nine o'clock and it's nine o'clock
well what do you think of telemarketing
sometimes there is good deals
i like the marketing in the mail because it's not so how do you say it's more private and you can look over the offer without the pressure of the
of the call
and sometimes good offers come i don't throw away everything i get
i i i see the things sometimes
good everything in life is a risk not me i think that there aren't many things that are a risk everything is a risk sometimes you win sometimes you lose right
the problem is when they bother you at an inopportune time or when they take advantage of a person
yes for me really i don't care because i don't usually answer the calls
yes
yes i know what telemarketing is
yes
and they call speak you in english or spanish
never in spanish
and then why here and here there lots of spanish people in angeles sometime they call in spanish
then i think you are the only person that talks spanish in seattle
according to fisher's survey
yes
but they don't do spanish marketing
and the other annoying thing sometimes you have lots of spam in the marketing computer
alex
there are lots of it should be more controlled by the law
sometimes i have a special email to filter
and sometimes i have a thousand emails of pure telemarking
and i have to throw them out i have to take ten or fifteen minutes to throw them outwhen i could be doing something more important
yes wow
that is incredible
but sometimes you get good things about a year ago i received something to go to a show near here
and i won some tickets to las vegas and tickets to disneyland
and i did not spend anything
there there are times when you get good things from the telemarketing
good
yes we have to be careful specially with the computer and the credit cards because most of the time is a trap
i have a friend that was cheated with a credit card marketing
and they took money from the bank from his account because he didn't think and gave his account number
and they charge him about two hundred dollars just to apply for the card
yes because
that happens very frequently that never should happen never give your tel financial information to a telemarketing party
because they are going to rob you is a legal robbery
and do you know other thing that have happened to me a lot
i have received letters from foreign institutions that want to send money to the united states
and and they want the bank account to make the transaction and i believe that is a trick where you are no goint to get anything they are going to clean all the money that you have in the bank
i do not think there are many people no
yes shows in africa
and from great britain also and one time i found out about a company that it was giving me an offer because they want to pay me lots of money
and at the end it was a fake company it was not true
ready to clean my bank account
mhm
yes
yes they always say that
yes
and and also it has happened to me that i won things on the computer
but i have to do a poll and en the poll i have to buy something
well we will pay
and i already know that it is a trick because you give your name your address and your phone number
and afterward they want more they want you to buy something
then i never do it and i have never received anything i never have receive anything to me it is like marketing
there should be laws against that trickery
free or or that you have won something
i think that is called a hook in spanish
and there is there is leny of that in spanish too
you will get in the next few days
yes that is good
i think that they are going to continue calling because they say that they make spontaneous calls so they are not but since they know your name as well if they are doing it spontaneously
yes
how are they going to know your name
hmm
yes
so i think that we agree the best marketing is by mail
or newspapers
yes i like it
i'm always up at this time
good evening milred of connecticut
good well look i i vote for my party but sometimes when i like a candidate from another party i vote for him too
i am not how do you say it i am not i am not i am not so fanatical that that in truth that i don't know since what they say since pure will i be pure idealistic for that party but
when i see that a candidate is going to do something good for my community or for the state then i do vote for him even though he might be from another one
i vote for the other candidates that that my party has but no that is it doesn't me i don't try to what is that called
aha aha
yes i think that they are a little more more conservative in some aspects but in some other things then sometimes like they get out of hand
yeah that is why i think that it is that they do not do not keep themselves much in in power because they let themselves get like like they get scared of it after they get into things like they
they get scared and start going backwards or they stay
but the fact of being conservative indicates to you that that you know they keep to the margin of certain things that they don't want to pass because they keep in line too much to the
to the questions of ethics and the questions of of of policy you know they follow too much i think that the concepts the democrats then what they see that is going to
how are you
still still that the people gets on top of them since they immediately go you know they do it even though everybody gets on top of them to say no that they do not want what they are
putting but in reality well i don't know in my in my country at least the democrats ehm have had the control for like for twentyeight years
and after those twentyeight years that the leader died that was the strong leader of that party then at that time it has been you know some years they vote democrat
others the next other four years they vote republican and the democrats return again and they again put the republicans depending like they depend on on on how they see the situation of the country if they see that the country did not do anything in those four years well they remove the person fast
yes yes
yes i think if a political party has a good candidate like the man who governed in puerto rico luis muñoz marin
he governed for twentyeight years he made a lot of good things you know he bring a lot of progress to the country because the country was very backward and he throw it forward
well he maintained the control of all the people after he died many generations even follow him
though he was dead they were following his idealism they didn't look what they were doing just did it
democrat popular party it was its its how do you say leader but it was not truth because they didn't see that he was doing something good
aha
i think it shouldn't be like that do you understand i think if a candidate who can be better we have to give him a chance
very fanatical
yes yes
yes for a face for a face and for a
because some gestures but
well but uh most of the time all politics make promises i'll do this i'll do that and that and that and when they win they forget what they had to do
or maybe they don't forget maybe they find a lot a lot of opposition because especially when a democrat party wins the election
and most of the house of representatives is dominated by republicans well then the task becomes a lot harder because not all them are going to approve the laws he proposes or the things he decides to do you know what i mean
and since they are the majority and the ones that will vote and counter the decision then most of the time i think it will be difficult
for a leader that a good leader but the rest of his party doesn't win then it will be difficult you know the uhm uhm
and why aren't you able to vote because you are not registered or because you do not want
doing everything we wants to do for his community
because the others won't give him a chance
i think it depends on you know let's suppose if the democrat candidate wins and they're almost all democrats
but when a democrat wins and the rest are republicans they'll make his life difficult
but there are some that work for their own benefit not really for the community's benefit
right right yes it's more bureaucratic i
of what is put hence the fights and the problems start and
yeah because of that i tell you that when whey they are not from the same party they always bring lots of problems then some want one thing and others want another
yes no you never know what it is that they are going to really to me i in politics well i tell you like i got involve about
after i got here about about four years ago i started to participate to take more action in the because i see what they didn't want to approve many things for hispanics and
oh okay
that they weren't treating very well so i got involve din the in politics to help but there is also lots of back and forth and they take you out they look even under the skin that you have to get it all out you know
everything they can look for to find if you run for for some position forget it they investigate your family and they get it out that if you sell this that if you had that that if your son did this that if your aunt did that it was like that
so i don't like that then i said no i can not be in this
so i continue working and i help them but no i didn't get involved you know to to run for anything i have nothing to be ashamed of but like i don't like the the
and especially i find that whites here they try to to manipulate a lot and control a lot
especially in the republican party the democratic one is a little more they have a little more of
of of that for hispanics but republicans are kind of racist they are more for for themselves
but the residents do not vote i thought that s
yes i always vote
i had a time i thought as well as i said ay i will not vote for what but ah i later involved myself in working with with one of the parties then i realized that we need to vote especially the hispanics
for you to listen to our voice and our vote there that counts
ah good evening speaks mercedes of philadelphia
just with the line of the pol of the party
ah i see i see i see ahm and about the let's say of what the people sa well what the people the ehm the conception that the eh democrats are more liberals and that the republicans are a little more
conservative what do you think of conservatives what do you think of that
yes
yes what i think also is that ehm maybe like ehm ahm ahm they are not much of of staying on the on the way right just that
they are on one side then they are like very ex not very extremist but they have to the extremes i think that that is why some
hmm
it is like that here it is like that and it is like that here as well but sometimes that ehm it is it is like that in my country i say as well but sometimes it is not so much ehm ehm s i would like that they realize they maybe it is an issue of the person not so much of the party
right or another thing i don't know because also it is the other side
mhm
very pleased well let's see we have to talk about politics
mhm
but sometimes mmm i should say it also the people are with the party right
eh and it doesn't
yes i mean maybe the candidate has no charity right but because the party votes for them at the same time
some people don't consider the qualifications or the capacity of the candidate just his charming as a person
that happens very often in my country the people fall in love as they say
oh yes because of the impression that they gave them or maybe not
their resume or curriculum right it's what they can or can not do
hmm
hmm
what do we think this for me is a little difficult theme because i have not been much well yes i have about six years living here but never as i can not vote never have i been interested enough for that is the politics of
hmm
yes
that's something i think is counterproductive right because i would think that everything is i would wish an ideal world where once they reach power everyone would work for everyone's benefit
exactly exactly and that's why let's say here the law making process is divided right first the congress then the senate and then the president right
but usually a bunch of laws come from the president's initiative right but they have to go through the senate and if the senate is
of the opposite part most of the senate is of the opposite party it's a big problem i mean it's good i think that's good because
there is some level of control right uhmm equality between the two parties but at the same time it slows down uh things and maybe creates more bureaucracy i mean
yes
and other thing that also one that i have read that they do here in the united states is for instance like a lot of laws it is an initiative of the president right
but usually they do them like a group right of eh of initiatives in one document for example right because like the they present them at once
because i am still not a citizen
to the to the to the senate for example one day and they place like addenda or additions right to the law that this other law this other law maybe people don't support those others but they do support the main one
but like these others where added on to that one they don't pass it then they say no no we are not going to pass it because because of that right and maybe the principal idea was that they didn't agree but now
they have to start again
mmh
mmh mmh
mmh mmh
mmh
yes
yes yes that is it a i that i agree on that yes that maybe for the same reason that they are i don't know
i am only ah a resident then i still can not vote and for e
no no they do not vote we do not vote one has to be eh a citizen to vote do you vote have you ever voted
ah
yes and whad do you think of the democrats or the republicans and the differences between them
mhm
hi
yes yes yes yes fine
yes yes sometimes the most superficual remains a little no and it begins to have well
uh huh uh huh
uh huh uh huh uh huh
yes yes yes
yes he had a look sort of pedantic no sometimes of a knowitall
and who knows i saw him a few times when he came here to philadelphia to do a pair of meetings
and for for me his message i believe he said smart things but no that he had just appeared to people that he hadn't just
about that to have enough charisma
un huh yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
um here well i'm surprised that there's only two big parties that the people have only two options because well in spain is really
uh huh and also the complete opposite like trying to appear like someone more like an uncle good i'm like you yes
yes yes yes yes that's the role he playswhich in fact is not because his family is a well they have a lot of money and is a to start i mean that
that he he is not one of us let's say but he is
n
yes yes yes yes yes yes
mm mm mm mm
but is all the opposite yes yes yes
mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm
of course of course
actually a bit chaotic no because there is
mm and what did you think of hillary clinton as candidate
yes
there are many options then
um you have from more conservative parties middle ecologist more left then
me for example i'm from barcelona so think there they have more catalan parties unless i don't know then
of options more or less i mean more or less big you have up to six more or less and then if you start counting the small parties you can have up to twenty
but those that have representation in the parliament there normally are um six parties then
however here is one it surprises me that is like that white or black
and and
i am laia from philadelphia
yes that's the problem also that's the problem because well if there were
exactly exactly yes yes sometime they aren't so different and you can you can feel a bit not represented no almost
um um
right
um um
um um
um um right
um um
how what's his name
oh okay yes yes that was a man um
fine and you
yes um
um um um um um um
yes no he was multimillionaire yes
yes yes and well and even though i don't know there had been in the last one there was a
nader or naser or or something like that ra ralph um
but of course to kick him out is a little through the vote to the trash no because you know that that really it will not be liked at all
um yes yes yes
yes um um um um
uh uh
of course of course
great
of course the the thing in spain is that he if you vote i don't know well one party votes that is very small
but that after that the i know as well that it is important because you know with the alliances that are formed if none of the parties has absolute majority well really a small party could be very decisive and very important in saying who who will rule this well has happened many times
in history then that means that it is not about deciding oh since it is a small party then i won't vote for it because it will do no good because it is
if it will really do somethig but of course in this system over here it really is a
one or another no
yes yes yes yes
uhm
uhm uhm uhm uhm
sure
sure and it's about time to break this this dynamic and also
well we have to talk about about politics don't we
well with all the money that is needed no to show up and the campaigns and
ah yes yes well i i agree the first ones that bush really earned people were really surprised at first the voting system was so complicated and i don't know what and why
there was really so much so much confusion in that
the democracy would therefore be bigger a lot stabler and i am not sure what else
but
exactly exactly exactly
yes yes yes
in 2000
yes
yes it was very strange truthfully truthfully
what
um um
yes yes
i see it surprised me a lot that al gore did not insist more uhm did not did not complain a little more did not because everything was so so strange so obscure that
that i don't know it surprised me that he retired so to soon that i don't know well i don't know if i don't know i don't know no to understand that
ehm ehm wel
hm yes and i suppose that things would have gone rather ehm different no yes
but well ehm yes
yes yes yes
uhm uhm
and nothing the and the la and the last ones too it was a little s well i don't know i felt very said because i thought that there would really be a change no and that the people
did we
it would have been
um um um um
um um um um um um um um yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes the second time is indisputable that is um
um
uh uh yes yes
because you can vote here
you you or your vote you're a citizen of america i mean
of course um um um um okay okay okay
um um um
yes yes did we spoke oh great uh uh uh
um
um um um
of course
of course yes yes yes
um um um um um of course of course yes yes at least a good thing that you have it's that there are only two terms for president no or that is that at least the next time well same is worse than bush but good i doubt it no
yes there that this is fine because in spain no there is no limit
and i don't know if the it's perpetuated in power during years and years and years
and well also it's fine that there is relief of
of course no although eight although eight yes now now they have been able to do enough yes yes yes
yes now do you know who the democratic candidate will be
i'm studying at the university at pennsylvania here in philadelphia
yes yes yes
in two thousand in the eight
uhm uhm uhm uhm
but i don't think that kerry will present himself again no
i mean
uhm uhm
uhm
uhm uhm uhm uhm
of course i see
uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm
hello
right yes i remember well let's talk about politics
so one needs to have a message like that simple
that of course and people believe what they hear but they only believe things that are simple and clear
like why do people not want to listen to much much explanation much of a complicated thing why does one lose them
like why do you have to say things in a very direct way and in a way that can be understood like like without any doubt
and i believe that kerry was maybe too smart
uh huh uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
yes yes and gore was even worse that gore was like so intellectual
that people couldn't listen to him
what do you think like what does a student from another country think about the politics here
they didn't hear him they felt that he was distant strange cold
of course of course of course a neighbor the man that lives in in the same block as you
of course
of course and i think that he is also very intelligent
i think he tries to much to appear stupid
like to convince people that he is not dangerous
like like his is like this
i think he's intelligent or if he's not intelligent at least the people in his government are intelligent
because they have done a lot of things not like that not by coincidence in other words
none of these things have happened without a plan
um
so
ah i like her ah eh i like her but i think is going to be difficult
um
yes
um um
yes
um look
look look
sure
hi ehm i'm nicole i talk from new york
sure sure and sometimes they are not so different
gray and gray bad and worse
yes um yes you have small parties that really have a different perspective compared to others but they don't have
don't have enough support
enough money either
em so you really have tow parties
i mean when you like always at the elections em when you to vote here em they point all the parties including the small ones em eh when you vote but the other they're a small percentage
one single time in the at the presidential elections we had an like a man that represented it represented an independent party
is eh ross perot eh
perot perot
hi how are you
tha was a few years ago same he he won lots lot of votes but
not enough to win but
i don't know he was a man very very rich
and of course is he could be a idealist person or with other thinking typically it cant
it cant
um oh yes nader nader yes also is
of course of course its not a or rather is for is like to say something symbolic
but not to really vote for him because not he is not going to win we all know that so hes him
eh he has many ideas really really good ideas in my in my opinion but
i would not vote for him just because i care a lot about who
fine
who will be president for real
uhm
sur uhm
sure
no it is always republicans and democrats always
that means
and since earlier days it has been like that that is many years ago there were other parties but
now at least th last one hundred years
have been like that
uhm
ehm
uh yes and what does the people think in in spain or what do you think about about about the things that have happened over here with the elections
so close and and counting the the the votes and the whole mess
um um yes
um
certainly certainly it is like the only one
because in this country we send people to other countries to monitor the elections to see that they are legal
and at the same time our own election is very complicated and difficult to understand
and really at the end of the year know that choice
so that was in the year 2000
this choice was like a means to an end it almost paid off or something
about politics we spoke before didn't we
because of the connections by bush and the brother of bush eh it was
florida's governor like like everything was a thing of li like it it was
like it was occurring in another place
uhm yes yes
uhm
yes yes i also i also so it that way like how is that how is that called ah i see
ehm uhm uhm
yes yes there was another one another history now that is
i imagini five years later
all of the things that have happened
i think we spoke before
uhm yes me too me too the last time really
the first time i felt much very very angry i really like people
the majority voted for gore and as bush pushed they felt angry and the second time they felt sad
because people voted for bush
as to how they would as they were going to vote again after all that had happened
i thought what country is this that is those who were voting
i don't know i don't know
sure well i vote but
yes yes yes yes i am a citizen i mean i was born here
so it's not that the system really need to change i think
yes are you from spain
because well the government must also change but the system for voting is very
it's very unfair because they go by state
they shouldn't go that way they should go the majority wins
period
that is because to go by state that gives a lot of power to the smaller states
um um
um
of course
of course yes yes yes i agree with that because every eight years they are eight years that is they are it's ah it's like enough time
we'll see what happens the next time i don't know
oh yes we did spoke before eh uhm eh you're ah alumni at the university there aren't you
no still no it's very it's very early still because that
it will happen in the year two thousand
eight that is the campaign will start in the two thousand seven already that is two more years
uhm but until know not it is not known
no
no kerry really no he was not a really strong candidate
in reality the democrats need someone more charismatic like with more personality
with more with a clearer message for the people
to see that today i don't know how it was before but today it is needed one needs in politics to have a very clear message for the people because the people
it is easily confused and like it does not does not have much attention like they don't have as much interest as before
david hi wendy
oh a bit not much it's that i haven't spoken to many people that's it
to help them to you know to direct them in their in their life you know
and and they only want help for themselves that they that they receive donations that help them here they want um food they want time
eh you know it takes away a lot of time from from one's life
you know em also
um
we all went
yes
but that's because they're already done from from the past times then that's how they that's how they were brought up the past times the old timers
eh yes the church went a lot every sunday we had to go to the church you know and and what happens in in these years
no no the the
for for
when you're growing up you lose your interest in church
and then then one one isn't passing that same raising to his children
and hmm hmm
the service
yeah uh i didn't speak with many people for the survey
yes
oh really
oh
oh okay
oh so you are in arizona how is the weather down there
oh yes
are you on a cell phone or in a house
oh how are you
oh in your car
oh oh
what happened
oh this is about religion yeah that's the way uh i've been talking about the same story for three days they haven't changed it
they don't they don't change the subject
right
oh no not on those days no it's like four or five days now that the topic is the same about religion
yeah and
yeah but man oh people get mad
it's a bad topic man
in arizona i'm here in connecticut
and yeah
no no the people i've talked to come one comes from la
right
right yeah
yeah no
yeah is very controversial because people get
let me tell you they get really mad that's another thing that the
fine fine and that no
yes because
well for for for me is that people i mean everybody believes in their religion no but there are different people
yeah i think i already spoke to you before
there are different people um different parts of the world like the chinese and the muslims the buddhists and the catholics the
there are different you know because they don't have the same upbringing
then right so then who who are we to say that that one religion is better than another
well but but people get angry you're attacking you are attacking their religion you know
it is uy
it is a topic to talk about let me tell you
because i am also catholic but you know i am i i since i was small i was um my mom always took me to church but sine since i was eighteen years old i mean i got married and i got married in in the catholic church
and and and all but for me it is you know there are so many problems who had the the the hard ones
in the catholic church you know i mean
with so much money that you pay so much money that's hard you know everybody works hard for their money
i think that i i spoke to you last week
so for i mean of course in the in the for for a donation for the church for the church to help other people poor people
and they are helping one another they help themselves because all the money that they are giving the families for them to shut up
you knot that money you know
and it was millions millions of dollars
no
yeah i mean up here where we live up here in like i li i am i live near massachusetts
and and all the problems were in the in the massachusetts church the churches in florida of of new york there were many many um priests
that were in involved with young boys
and and well now with for thirty years they raised their the church already knew of the of the oh priests that had problems and if they had a problem
they paid the family so that they kept quiet you know and
yes your voice sounds familiar
yeah and all that money came out from the collection fee all that money came from the church and it was millions and millions of dollars
two hundred thousand a hundred thousand
tu sabes
it depends that is
uhm including the the the the the people that go to church
no
i am sorry of his salary i see but
yeah you thite you do your your thites but the the
if if they do that and if they investigate like it is a wcw two let me see your your your your your your your paycheck
you know you make yeah ifnot you can not go to church
yes yes i am from from texas right
yeah if
but it's the same thing i know the church that is here but tthe the church when i was and is large and the people that go there
m they have priests and you know what that is because everybody has their name on the envelope and that is no you only gave twenty dollars this week
you have to give them twenty two dollars no you win six hundred and fifty dollars minus the taxes
you have to give it to church to church you have to give a thirty percent of that you know and then they wait they expect it
yes
hm
hm mm
yes you have to put um um yeah
aha
you used to live in texas
aha lutheran i see
okay hm
ah yes
hm
of course
hm ok
oh
well yeah yes when i was young when i i went to catholic school and we went to church every day
so but
yes
how are you
ah yea ah but i was going to ask you about how old are you
twentysix ok then you are still young we have i am i am forty years old
and with and when we went to school before it was differen i mean um the church was more more no no they didn't ask so much it was more to you know
um more
more yeah you know you went to to go to church because you went to pray
you know then one prayed more and and it was more for the person than for the church
then on these days it's more for the church than the person
you know eh that's the key you want to go to church so that you could help the church
you know instead of staying in their business this and that that they help him and that everybody goes backwards you know but eh sincerely
the church is for the for the youth or you know for the person
hi my name is wendy
