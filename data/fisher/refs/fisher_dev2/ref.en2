mhm

hello good af good evening
ah okay
oh well is very good
no no
no i was married but not anymore yes
well and you've been many years here in atlanta
oh same as me i've been here eleven years i arrived here in ninetyfour to go to the university
oh okay
well you can say that you can say that you are already from atlanta then
more or less but do you return to to peru every now and then
oh okay
ah well look at that i'm from
it becomes hard no
that becomes difficult sometimes one gets involved in one's own life and it becomes difficult to get to return to one's homeland to visit
well exactly yes i know that is to return oh a a a the flight to puerto rico is on sale since it is not that expensive one can find it
at least two hundred round trip
but if it is not on sale you are paying five hundred to six hundred per person
yes it is about three hours from here flying
yes so i imagine that in all of then it is much more expensive
do you have family over here
oh
well they said that we could talk about any thing but you know
yes we're very close is this the first call you've taken
if you want to talk about marriage well we could talk about any married couple
i don't know mine lasted three years and sincerely it was it was because i married too you know too young
and we did not have well you know we had ideas that were not
compatible with each other and then when we began real life that
that we said well no we could not maintain the relationship
no
no
no and we couldn't you know we got divorced but we maintained a friendship although it's been years since i heard from him but we left you know
it was not something ugly we did not split up with hatred nothing like that
and i always wanted the best for him but it's simply that we made a a mistake when at our age and our maturity and when in
ah and i carry a cell phone they called me three times but i was at the store where i couldn't you know grab ten minutes to talk
we did that
yes thank god
yeah that means yu met you wife here right
in atlanta
um but is he from peru aswell
oh ok and do you have kids
oh that's cute
oh god bless them
i hope one day they do but if not you know i'm happy with my life
yeah let's see yea because i said after that i said that next time i won't marry anyone until i know that
but where are you from
and it doesn't go well with my heart it's gon na be forever
it doest matter what comes along i can handle it and i can accept it
so we are going to see
yes that is the most important thing
to want it and have faith
i don't know well you parents are they still in peru
ah okay
ah well my mother and father moved over here after i moved
and then my my brother also followed me here and all now i have all my family here
yes mom lives near the airport and my father and my mother are i think they will turn 30 and 50 years old this year in december
puerto rico
of marriage yes
yes
yes they met each other when mommy is two years older than daddy but they met when daddy was eight whe no sorry fourteen years old and mommy was sixteen
and they became boyfriend and girlfriend almost immediately and since then until now they're together
so that's a positive marriage that we can talk about
yes
yes what happened with well you know of course mommy loves daddy a lot and that has a lot to do with it but also what happened with my mother that she
came from a poor family a single mom
and she never had anything that she c could call you know hers
and then when she found dad y he was the lo the love of her life and she got married well she the had something her family it was
yes yes
you know her belongings
and she very much because of that
yes exactly exactly
ah
not because but they also say maybe right to to me we only have one soulmate one
you know the one that is for you another person
so after you've been with that person if something happens and that person leaves you know you don't need to look for anybody else because you should be satisfied that you had the one for a while
yes
exexactly karma
oh yes
well yes eh they said we could talk about goal marriage or talk about whatever
oh yes it's important to know about those things because lots of people don't want to take responsibility for their actions they think that
they won't pay for what they are doing
and that's not like that
exactly
exactly
i have i i believe in in karma for my own
how do you say it because of my spiritual beliefs
but even if someone wants to believe in karma only it's not scientific if it is energy energy never goes away it's never destroyed
so if you create a positive energy that energy has to go somewhere
and then it will come back to you cause you created it
ah okay well we're already using it right are you married
and so in a spiritual point of view the way i see it god created us so that we would live good lives but you are responsible for your actions
hello
ah yes he's on his own now
ah you've recently moved
ah okay and you already all and you still miss them right
mm
yes yes i'm i'm married
eight
ah look well my kids are still small one is seven and the other just turned three two days ago
yes time goes by really fast and you don't count your age and the kids grow
ah yes
aha
good night
yes
ah and yes now yes
yes marriages now the ones that really last are very rare
no now for anything and problems and right there they split like that
many times no
they don't they don't tr they don't try to improve things in their marriage
no he's american
ah yes mine is darkskinned american
mine is darkskinned american
ah i am the one here with the lighter skin
ah my name is norma i'm speaking from atlanta georgia
no my husband is black no but he's really good
oh now american women are really independend because now they want to do no
ah
yeah
yeah of course suddenly they don't
the don't appreciate that much like before no now it is different all the mentality towards marriage has changed so much
yeah
yeah
yes
ah yes that's cool no
ah okay how are you
ah yes the husband is the wife is who handles
ah yes
i think maybe we as latin americans are more used to it's it's a more patriarchal society more patriarchal than anything else
then we will always be because of how we grew up no maybe we are more flexible
yeah
heh
sure maybe that's why they split up no there are many divorces
marriage doesn't last one of the
of the factors
aha
ah here yes well soso here with the kids
is that if you like as good latin some many times is they are get used right speak out
ah
ah yes companies are different although one does not not i but the principle does not but really there are many differences cultural differences no
aha
ah you
aha
yes yes i also had one or i have a friend who married an american and he says like that latina women are different
yes really he he appreciates it a lot he says
no because he latin women are too different no no they don't make they don't make much trouble
ah that's it one is more loyal i gues
ah okay
you can tell no that we are more faithful really
more more a lot more loyalty
mmm
aha
of course it is very sad no that now marriages don't last long and really if they have children the children suffer
yes
i see
oh yes
oh the poor children
uhhuh i see
yes yes i have two kids
yes the children suffer that's enough they are traumatized when they are very young and they have all these problems don't they at home
they're traumatized enough
uhhuh
you're right
oh yes it's really sad isn't it because of that there are many
many times the government take off the children to people like this when they're not taking along well when
no they maltreat them psicologically or
or phisical or physically
mhm
ah yes then
ah yes you have two kids too
ah yes they fight hard
aha
ah they are grownups now teenagers
hello
yes he moved to a place that is about ten minutes away from my house
well so aha you came down the hill you already came down so
yes i miss them but every now and then he calls me or comes by here on the weekends to eat or something
yes and are you married
how many years
ah i've been married eighteen in november
ah still yes yes i every now and then look at my kid's pictures and say oh my god how much time has gone by
yes yes the other day he was mad with me because i still hadn't left and he a man thought that he was my boyfriend
because people don't believe my age
so then he was mad saying i'm not his girlfriend i'm not her boyfriend that's my mom i see you and such small kids they should be happy that people think your mom looks younger
good night yes my no my name is tami
well mad mad but ultimately what i've realized also is that people
here it's very quick to to divorce
nobody wants to work for their marriage
mhm
mhm
there is no patience
your hus is your husband latin
mine is too
yes that one you gave me how
mine is white i am the one with the dark skin
oh i'm from washington in the state of washington
ah
oh yes my husband always thanks god for being from panama and for me being send to panama and also for meeting each other
because american women he said
no he doesn't like them he says not because for the independence but for the lack of respect for marriage he says
that's what he says but not because how i am i'm really independent but
i always take care of him
you know i don't give him
yes is is so different because mu husband now works with some boys
and they his coworkers they are americans don't they
women give them like 20 dollars every two weeks for lunches everyone else stays with her those are americnas so they could it makes me laugh my husband has and xbox so they come and play here at home
eh good and you
and i laugh because my husband calls and ask me if they can come over and play they look like teenagers if i said no he tells his coworkers that his wife did not give him permission so i laugh
and you your wife lets you do whatever you want the other ones have to aks i laugh and i said listen
working all day and only for an hour of relaxation no
yes and i laugh because when they go to lunches to the to my husband's job i tell him when you want to go go i don't care
he says we can't go because this other guy didn't get permission i say who didn't give him permission and he says the wife he he called her
yes totally
i say no way for us
hmm
yes that's what i i imagine we are a little more flexible and they like tat and if you they're happy they're happy with you
but with these women i tell her he's going to leave
i was painting my house
because if she's got him on so tight a leash that man is going to find someplace else
hmm but no
they don't understand
mhmi say no my husband my my children always laugh because punishment is that if we my husband and i we do not yell in the house plaster if that if anything i'm calling and eh
i have a loud as i am on the second floor of the house
my son says do not fight i say i'm not fighting i'm screaming
aha exactly and my son i always say and they tell me to be crying man you want me to tell you when i'm screaming i teach my pa
so
is is that quite different
yes it is giving giving so much laughter because my husband knows co since i met him um i did not know him as well dressed
and i got a call and i say okay oh god so are you married
then i always i always wear clothes outside
in the morning i say i uh i do not bother i know how to put it out and give you work work in and i say good
it is the only that looks good at work why you employ
i tell all those who go to pants with holes and women who do not see it anywhere and say my husband and i do not give work and dress well they have with problem with it
y se echa a reirse a mi no me importa que que dice estoy tranquila con mi mujer me dice le digo bueno pues ai no eh
mm

yes but here
me too i
mmm
not here here he doesn't care he i have a my husband's best friend's friend got married and in five years they were divorced and it was that prostitute and that
other women and what do i know i say oh my god and we stuck in the middle because i was the wife's friend and my husband is best friends with him

but like that
yes yes i have one here my nextdoor neighbor
oh she married a man and he already had a son who is about eight years old oh eight years
and they had two and this woman they were to the boy in person
don't touch my children you are not my son and i don't know that here i say i would like to grab this kid and take him here to my house
because since i threw him out sometimes i tell you the other day i told her you know that when i am in my house i don't want to hear your conversation about about when you're speaking dirty to your exhusband and i don't know why you are speaking so loudly
yes i have tow kids well one is nineteen years old and the other one is fifteen years old
and your kids i say your poor kids that are hearing all this these bad things that you say to their father

yes that's true this woman do not work the dad bought the house and give them money monthly
aha yes the older one has already left home
but his i would think hey if you get money monthly hey do something help other people or something won't be into the house i think that's why she is frustrated
because she do nothing and those kids misbehave so badm i say oh god i got to tell them off because they are by my side too with these slingshot and don't know what
ah ah and me with the husband i didn't take along
i he came to shouting into my house and i sent my husband he kept staring at me and he said i never seen you this way and i told him well when you bother a latin american and bother

ah
it seems like we're the only hispanics or what
it's true that you were a hare krishna right
yes yes i knew that ok
aha
aha
yes yes yes aha
aha yes
yes and also music they use now they're making music for mathematics
i mean two plus two make four four plus four make eight and many more many more for mathematics for
to learn to write and spelling too there is a song that if you can write this word it teaches to sing it so that your remember the word
there are many things out there with music everything is music because many kids sometimes don't learn if it's not by talking my son learned a lot with music
okay
he learned the the the the times tables with music and i taught him like that you know
aha
right yes yes exactly
aha aha aha
you know that i for my older kid my older kid i recorded the songs that i red to him in english
my brother recorded them for him in spanish
then one day he heard them in spanish another day in english
in a journal yes yes and i had the book then we bought the book in spanish he followed the story in spanish it was good good it was good by brother said put it in spanish too not just in english
because i i read him many stories sometimes i was tired i then i played a tape and he played by himself and heard the story
he didn't i didn't have to be reading the same story sixty and a thousand times
maybe maybe what music do i like i like merengue
because when you are young like that one has to read a lot
exactly exactly
exactly yes
yes yes it is true it is true yes anyway how many minutes do we have i am already tired listen i worked so hard oh my god
and i also sing while at work i can tell you that
i do because that way i feel the time goes by quickly when i sing and i i don't let people that fight each other to get in my way
i'm always singing yes if you they call me the singing assistant because i sing all the time
i have to sing yes yes yes
oh yes yes yes they swear a lot
it does they swear a lot i don't know how their mothers allow that i once went to a party
i like charismatic music that we are putting in the catholic church
and there was a young girl there i think she was around three years old and they were playing that music so i turned it off
and i said hey this is a children's party i brought my music i always have music with me and since i'm going to act as a clown i'm going to put the music that i want so i went there and played my music and the children started saying that my music was old people's music i don't want that
they wanted to listen to that music so i spoke with the mother and told her how can you allow them to listen to that
all those bad words they are saying and i said that's terrible
yes yes yes yes yes
yes
aha
yes it is true the games those games
that are so violent my god
you know mothers and fathers buy them to get the kids out of out of their sight
we have been putting a lot of charismatic music that one of them what he sings if young two robles um miguel aquino for me good ah it's like merengue but with jesus christ in the music
but they are really bad because some are all day i have a nephew who goes into his room all day to listen to music and to play those games you don't see him
you don't see him and he is fourteen years old
yes yes yes yes
aha aha
yes aha it makes me sad for the children who are growing up now
yes yes yes yes and less social because
when you are on the computer or when you are listening to music
you don't become social you don't start talking to people or anything
they don't want to see people
aha yes yes yes mine the same the same he doesn't like talking to people i tell you that he has to be social
how are you good night
ah okay ah okay
yeah we had to talk about music uh well i i like music right the music the music called salsa
right that is uh that's hispanic right hispanic music also the music we play in our church too we call it quirta
right it is in sanskrit language that's like very cheerful
and i also like romantic music right the ballads that well i don't think they're called ballads anymore
yeah that kind that kind of music uh um
uh um
oh right you're the one the one who does like a clown
uh um right your career demands it
sure because to cheer the children you have to move right
ah i'm normal from atlanta georgia
right
sure of course it is something it is an active episode no
you love them yes i love them for example teach them something give them a lesson like humor it is very important for children to
that is feel thry are part they are part of the program
yea
um hu
oh yeah everything is good the
um hu
sure yes or it many times when they utilize the music no
is this way that people remembers the things that pass
ah really i don't know
no i above all the kids and as they are forming no they have more memories they have better memory so
something like more stays in their minds
aha
um hu
um hu
hm hu
of
sure music is part of the culture every culture has its own music
and they identify with that mus those people identify themselves each culture no with with a given music for example hispanic culture many
no they identify with salsa merengue no those active dances that music
aha
no and many people like this um
and this he's fourteen years old
ah yes him i remember him
well yes i have music my husband he likes music the most more than i do
no he really likes music he plays the piano a little bit
yes and yes he so he we have a lot of devotional music like in our church
and he's the one who learned to play the harmonica the bridanga and the cartal
we're also teaching all these things to our kids
yes yeah
for this the music is really important above all in the churches
i don't know all of a sudden
no music always gives a good message
for the people no so that people remember no i look at it this way even when i watch a television show
no i see that christian people also have their music that they sing that they get quite emotional
and everything with music that is music really has a big influence in people's lives
um hu
yes um hu
um hu
um sure yes because now for example kids when here in the abc in the alphabet
that is that famous song abcd
just now my little one who is three he is also there with his games there he has a train game that we bought because it was his birthday a few days ago
all of a sudden and the group isn't that big
then there he is there with songs the alphabet then he there records it and he is recording himself there the song
um hu
that way it is good aha
um hu
ah yes yes because children whey they are little they are like a little sponge they learn everything
no everything that is recorded in their mind no like that is the best time to teach them
better the good things good habits
a
sure um hu
yes well that cheers you up
aha
well it depends i mean music too because there are certain types of music that i don't like like rap lots of young people listen to that
i don't like that type of music it sucks
aha
um hu
oh my god yes they say lots of bad words there
sure they learn them kids speak of all those things they speak of violence and all those things
stuff like that heavy it's bad for kids
exactly because of that there are not many many children and they get into so many problems adolescents start to use arms and all that consequence of all that influence they have
all the
of all that music of all that all that they see on television and all the matter of violence
uhuhm
um hu oh those games too those games
yes
um hu
oh my god of course and children on top of that also because of that many times they are influenced no the lack of activity the children there is a lot of child obesity
no that they are inactive they are in front of the computer using their games or with the television
no because of that there are people they are not the children
yes the children always now are like more inactive
um hu
of course
um hu
ah what they are spiritual music with merengue
of course they isolate themselves
hi hello
it's pop music but it's not rock he plays the guitar and writes songs
uhhuh

oh ha oh ha
well what type of music do you like
and it your family here aswell
mhm yes
oh
oh yes
oh yes
oh uhhuh oh
oh uhhuh
oh
i was born here
no yes
hello good evening this is mildre speaking from connecticut
where are you from
feeling the things that had moral values that sent you a message
oh
dominican
aha
oh yes but i don't speak dominican you speak more
mhm
i therefore am puerto rican and i like the salsa music
i love dancing
and i find that music makes us know the many countries at least in puerto rico has many great eh composers writers and artists have
jennifer lopez marc anthony
oh yes yea yes we spoke
gilberto santa rosa are known in many countries
oh i think that the music i love it i put in on when i'm in the house i dance i clean faster it cheers me up it takes away the depressions
when i'm feeling sad
or when i'm nostalgic about my country
i listen to the songs that sang that my mom sang
and you you like music
oh
mm
aha
so how old is the girl
how are you is everything okay
oh okay yes that's a time for the music
they say that kids that one raises with music they relax and learn much more and they are more intellegent
i don't know if its true but
ha
yeah no while kids girl kids have their best time
i think what the do is what they do since the moment the are born
four or five years something like that
so then they forget a lot of things
yeah
oh
good thanks the best
oh that's good retarded kids also learn a lot with music
because my son had a partner that had a kid with down´s syndrome and
and she used to put him music and the kid was learning everything good and fast
the fastest that he could learn
and knew the songs from the memory
aha
aha
aha aha
and she´s exercising them mhm
it helps her to know her body better and relax of course because the music is good
i think we talked about marriage
aha aha
i like it i go many times to watch salsa concerts when there is one other times
merengue concerts i don't really see lots of merengue ones lately then i like most really like the typical music music of
how do you call it like saying from our field inward
the full the bomb and all that and after when
they do presentations in new york of bomb and full then we go there
and we go see olga tañon's concerts too
that that has a lot of good music and the other guy who performs salsa the other ay my god how it was victor manuel
i can not lose their concerts we always go
here they do a lot of concerts and we always go
yeah
yeah
yes because if your family is more
dominican then i imagine they dance more to dominican music
oh yes
yeah
yeah they left
oh and now they stayed there
like a kid in the same class as my girl they asked where are you from and he said i'm a mix salad and they asked why because my dad is
my dad is from this country my mom is from another my grandparents had a race mixture he says i don't know what i am anymore
aha aha
yeah yeah yeah
i have taught all the typical music from my country to my daughters
i have taught them the dances i have taught them the music and they well no they don't hear it so much but they know how to dance it
and then i used to belong here to a puerto rican parade group
and and we did dance presentations i was in charge of teaching girls how to dance how to dance bomba to dance plena
to dance salsa
so my my my daughters know how to dance all that because they they like music so much all of them
all of them love music
yes typical music is nicer much nicer
i i also like peruvian music i find it beautiful
the music of the chinese india cause i like it very much too their music is is beautiful i don´t understand what it says but
yeah
yes but the sound it has you know like it it relaxes you
and now when i went to puerto rico i bought one of those discs that contains music of the water
of of the trees of
uh when you want to relax if you´re tense you put that music and it sounds good very beautiful
it sounds pretty beautiful
right
yes right yes with no message and nothing
and you get with the one that you have to store and buy store and
that´s why i say that music is so important for well at least for me
because i was raised with all my family with music always
today is music
my children my daughter is sixteen years old so she is in the regueton cuestion and hip hop and that music
my daughters are already bigger and hear more american music
and
and myself for example i hear rock and roll and i listen and share with the the people but i can not tolerate it for a long time
it puts my nerves in a bad state and makes me pretty agitated
so i don't like rock and roll i hear it and i have young friends who have a band
and sometimes they invite me to go see them and i go and stay a little while with them bus after i say no let's go let's go because my head is echoing
those sounds in my ears
yes of the reggaeton now
i believe that the music from composers from before differs a lot from the music of today because they were dedicated to romantics things the things with
hello
yes
yes
i don't care about this music and the lyrics really bother me what they say
yes that i like that class of music put they don't say and for this reason
yes
yes
well well born in puerto rico but moved to the united states when he was five or six years but my parents are dominican
i assume i feel that i am
no no i'm dominican puerto rican and i'm not because i spent every summer in santo domingo with my family but i forget my godmother
i watched was puerto rican so you know i have of them
no but you know it depends on how i get it
and you
mhm
mhm
mhm
i think i spoke to you before this is annie from miami
yes
mm mm
yes
mm
i like it i always listen to christian music
eh but also you know since i have a little girl i'm trying to to teach or we're going to teach her different types of music so i always have her listening to
eh classic music or latin music for kids
eh or or in english eh you know the music that teaches the colors or the alphabet or something like that and right now in this stage of my life i'm more
you know with kids music
that let's say the music that i like more
but
she is she's twenty months
yeah and
i don't know this night we wont to buy and she was in the car singing the song of the alphabet
you know and my husband told me shes a little too young for that and i said i don't know but shes singing to you
you know
yeah
yeah
well to me everything
i've always forgotten things you know music for us is something like like um um
you know important we don't watch a lot of tv
yes good and you
so what i mean lets say she learns about animals what ever it is about music and the books we read
yes
aha
mhm mhm
yes
yes and that´s how she is many times used to start oh i don´t remember what song but we had a disc the song was named poorly written phrase
my aunt monica or something like that
and she used to like to dance when the people saw her dancing she was saying ulala ulala you know
something like that and today probably she didn´t hear this song for 2 or three weeks and she started all day ulala ulala and i thought ok i knew she was remembering the song
you know but i like it because seeing how she was moving her legs and knees etc you know like that
eh i do not remember the topic we were given last time
we can do the dance parts too and she can learn the parts of the songs aha
that´s how she´s learning how to know her body therefore
and the language too because what we are doing you know i when my husband is not home i talk only in spanish
then when he arrives eh completely right ninety percent in english some times you know i keep talking in spanish because i'm used too but
that way she can grab both languages and that is the reason for having all the music with her so she can be able to hear it in english and spanish
aha
the full and stuff like that
mhm
mhm
mhm
that was that was that you have
mhm
then
hmm and us i prefer the the merengue
instead of salsa
but
uh well it's the same because my parents lived in puerto rico i think it was twentysomething years before coming to the us so
you know it's not like we are a typical eh typical family
because they lived in santo domingo so the revolution they had
they left and went to puerto rico and from puerto rico they came to miami
yeah so you know they spent a long time in puerto rico and that's why i say i don't know which country i'm from because i'm like
five children right
a mixture you know of both
yes i i feel like that many times because sometimes i don't feel no not comfortable but you know sometimes i don't feel very puerto rican
and i don't feel very dominican it depends
so that but you know i i like the the both cultures and it's not so different but you know they have they have some eh
words that that
mhm
yes
mhm
mhm that's nice
mhm
yes
i
i too what what i the salsa you know you know it's ok or whatever but i think that of all kinds of music i like typical music
you know yes and how not yes no i don't know i like it more and i like to see them dance even more when people dance salsa or whatever
mhm
yes
right
mhm oh that´s nice
mhm
yes that´s good that too that we we do many times that when you know how to do it now before that call we had arrived from from shopping
not even five minutes and normally what we do is that uh we turn on the radio and put one that you know like a song whose music is middle
yes
that´s it nothing but music no lyrics
and that yes that too h helps at least it helps me to be able to you know relax or whatever
yes
mhm
mhm
yeah
yes
yes
yes
yes
hell um what is your name
what do you think about cell phones do you have one
i don't have one right now when i was in europe i had a phone
but here i don't have one because it is too expensive
and i don't have i have little money because i'm a student
and i have decided not to have a cell phone but eh that is not the only reason also i have never liked cell phones that much i am not sure they are healthy
because of the radiation they emit no haven't they had any studies
proving that really they are not harmful
and i don't want to use a phone throughout my whole life and twenty years later they discover that it was bad for one's health
and we all have brain cancer or something like that
of course and it is not known until later whether it was good or not
pilar
it's a shame but
yes and that's dangerous
that's dangerous there are too many accidents well now there are less because people is using headsets free hands i don't know how they are called
but many people still don use it and when you're missing a hand i don't know how can they drive
hm
yes because it's true sometimes in the
in the bus people use their phones really loudly
and that's rude no
because there is no need to talk that loud you can talk a lot more quieter
yes yes well with but i believe that they used satellite phones the the mobile phones didn't work well because the but sometimes they did work and yes
pleasure where do you con from
yes sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't
but well it is it is true that the advantages i see it is that you can always be found
if the battery does not run out if for any reason they need you or need to talk with you
they can always find you and that is very good
and and then well eh also in cases of emergency
you can call if you are stuck on the road with a broken down card and or what do i know something happens you can call and ask
and ask for help and that is good that's why when i have more money and i can pay for it i'm going to get a mobile phone but what i'll do will be to use it with that earphone
are those also here in the united states also
ah well i will find out about that because eh
sure
and where do you say do you say you live
sure because in the other contract you have to pay every month
also very often the plans includes the calls that's why they are more expensive
in europe i had a plan i was paying basic service and i just had to pay additional calls but if a call just a few
it was very cheaper
sure
hm
of course
hm mm
the cell phone use depends of the countries i have been living in australia and there the eighty percent of the people use cell phones
i mean a very few didn't have a cell phone like little kids or very old people who don't want to use them
en oh i don't know that
everybody around the world has a mobile phone will i am in the united states since some time i left for a while and came back about three years ago
no no body used to use a mobile phone and now everybody does
the mobil phone has arrived here and it is the same as it was in europe now
yes people talk very loud in the subway the bus and that is not very polite to the ones standing around there are people talking on the streets
the phone is carried in the pocket and the headset is very small it appears that people are talking alone
yes i you think that they might be crazy
i got used to it now it seems normal to me the only difference is that in europe people text more than here
there are short texts messages
to send a message is much cheaper in europe
the calls are cheaper but i don't know how much would a call can cost
ah huh
the minimum rate is per minute on the other hand the messages cost twenty five cents per messageevery time you make a phone call you have to talk for more than a minute
enton
sure
that is not important of course
but therewell it was popular there among the students above all
because they are the fastest to write because with writing with a phone is complicared because the only has new keys all the letters
but the the students changed it into some type of game and ability they even had contests to see who could type faster
and they would save a lot of money sending messages instead of instead of calling they even have tactics some kind of language
and sure if you call and hang up with out creating a hung up
that it stays written whoever called you
hm mm
then the the younge people use this to call well to say give signals deci when they call you it is called a lost that is called to make a lost
when i make a lost it calls me the lost come down because i'm waiting for you downstairs and sometimes only for demos if i remember you then
they call and hang up and ya and i remember you instead of sending an email or simple its a message from
i remember you i mean that the people from europe has a lot of imagination to save money yes
a lot of cre a lot of creativity
right but
of course yes
but that's very good
uh but if you use it more seek combinations that you use it with the head with the earphone earplug what's it called
the headset but that g that goes far so you don't get radiation
i am from spain and i live i live in new york
just in case
and what
sure sure
and have you heard about the phones of of the next generation that already that already are arriving
ah no i
yes i suppose that also but i'm talking about the ones where you can even watch television
you can watch through internet you can check your email that have everything now it's like a mini computer with and internet connection that's supposed to come one day they've been preparing it for a long time but it never arrives
in europe they have them in some places they have them in austria they had them already they had just come out last year
i didn't see it never i never used it because it was it was more expensive of course but that that would be very good
hm
no no it is because i for what i've seen from all over euro from all over the united states i have already talked with people from well that we had to we have to talk about cell phones no
ah sure and it communicated with with the machine
hello
ah yes yes yes yes yes
i do have a cell phone but the truth is that it is almost as if i didn't have it because i almost don't use it nor do i receive many calls
yes i do use it it is eh really really rare that i use it and you
hm mm
yes
hm mm
yes ah because because why
hm mm
hm mm
hm yes
my name is mercedes and and you
like almost everything you start using technology let's say like with teflon they are doing the same right that maybe yes yes
yes
yew and well you have to drive and you think about the ones who drive and talk at the same time
yes that's terrible and i agree
mmm
for someone like me i think it doesn't bother me it's just that people don't have respect about their cellphone usage
right i mean they don't have manner in the way they use their
cellphone
hmm
exactly
ah pleasure
yes but i think that most of it its people who don't respect where they are calling from people who is driving but
well that's the convenience well that's what are cellphones are supposed to be they are a technology that makes communications easier in many
situations for example now with the hurricane it was the only way many people could talk with their family
yes this is of course because we have a friend who was in new orleans and we tried to call the cell phone and yes it it was down the
the network
and it didn't work hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
hm mm hm mm
hm mm
mm i live in but i am honduran of origin
it is the and what but also let's say they have the ones that are with a card true there are some that use a card that you just buy a card and use what is on the card
mm i i believe they sell them at walmat
with yes yes yes because they say there isn't because a problem is that you have to sign a real contract and the contract is never less than one or two years
i understand that i don't have to sign the contract and i have a card to buy something that i'm going to use later
hm mm
yes
sure yes that's the problem we have now my plan as a say it is almost a cellular one but i hardly use it
at least we have acumulative minuts but we acumulate so many minutes that we are not going to use them
there is no chance for us to use them
anyway there it is they are accumulating and let's say europe has a cellular culture very similar to here in united states or
en
hm mm
hm mm
hmmmm
there are the same problems in europe as here people does not respect the places to use their cell phones
that has happened to me because i have come to think that people are trying to talk to me
hm mm
hm hm hm
hm mm
i agree because here that is not very common
in my country we could say it is a little more common but i believe that depends on the economical posivilities of the people
mm it is to the west of the city of philadelphia
my country there is not much money like here rightthe people here here it is twenty five cents they are
exactly
hm mm
hm mm hm mm i could not
hm mm
hm mm
okay
yea
hm
imagination many do uh
past the following town is
a lot of creativity that's the word yes no i well as i was saying i would have to practice a lot to get some but no and as i say since i barely use it
and to tell the truth the only and what the truth is that i do u have it but for emergencies mostly and yes
some day my tire will get flat the car
i mostly the truth is uh huh
no
yes yes yes
yes yes
i'm going to have to to see if i buy one of them because it is dangerous right and s s ah that i the only one that i speak to from my fam family is my husband and he always that
when he's driving if he's driving he hangs up the phone i don't want you to speak on the phone and driving
i mean it's that almost never the truth few ma many few times
and you
it's are those the ones that have um the your credit card and all of that inside them your information
no
ah
aha aha
ah
someone that had been in norw in norway told me that the ones they had is co ba basically with the cell could do anything buy eh food from a vending machine
pay eh the parking meter like that because it had your credit card information
ah no i thought they were only talking um it was only people from the philadelphia area
hello hi my name is auria
okay
oh okay
it's kind that way but with the exceltion that here almost never snows but the cold arrives at january and lasts until middle march
then spring starts and that isn't that long it's like three or four weeks and then the heat
exactly
yes
i'm from puerto rico
yes and you
oh well i was also born here in north carolina i was raised there and then i moved to puerto rico when i was 12 years old
that was when i learned spanish
auria
i mean speak spanish because i understood my parents they spoke to my in spanish but i always replied english
well same here more or less at fourteen also because at twelve i moved over there but i was almost thirteen
and i am reuse not me i did not want to know anything about spanish did not want to know about puerto rico i was very wild because they got me out
you know from my school my friends
sure you know after a year of not having friends because no one spoke spanish well my mind changed
north carolina
yes
exactly
well it depends on the courtesy of the person who uses it
is my opinion i do not think there should be laws how you suppose to use it or not
nicole happy to meet you
simple i think that a person should have courtesy to know if you are at the movies you should not use if you are at a restaurant you should not use it
but at least excuse yourself to go outside
exactly
yes
but to some if it was urgent you can say it with permission
i'll be back in then minutes you leave go outside pick up the call and and
and yes but the people like you say don't have the courtesy
the only law that i believe should exist is when you must guide
because i have seen the front a lot of accidents happen because the person in front of me was talking on the phone
is on the highway and because they are on the phone they passed their stop their exit their escape
good good and you
and then they do it like i said to turn to get too their exit and i saw the accidents happen because of that
at least it should use an ear bud or earpiece as they say
yes when you are in the car
yes
exactly
or it's like you are wasting the moment with the person you are with
exactly
i i agree with you i think that so much advancing technology communication as you say at the same time we as a society have the habit of
pulling us out of the moment
you know with the television videos what do i know music
i am a little north of atlanta
well you don't live in the same moment and the phone sometimes well it distracts you from the moment too and sometimes i answer the phone when i shouldn't
if i'm playing with my little girl she's four years old she'll only be four for another year
you know and i'll never be able to go back to that moment
while the person who's calling me well i can talk with them you know
exactly
exactly
exactly and you don't
yes that's true but it's that some people like you say it's like a mania or something they always have to answer the phone when it rings
and it's a thing even though they don't even talk for a minute but they have to answer the phone right when it rings
but i don't i don't answer when i'm in a time that i know that i can dedicate the time to talk with w person but if i
it's hot but pretty good and where are you
i'm doing something cooking or reading a book to tha baby cause you know i let him dream
and then i called him back look mommy i'm sorry or look dude i'm sorry
right
yes i know
right
it supposed that yes
no the same but aja mommy mi mom is a teacher too and she has the same problems a lot
she teachs spanish in a high school too
a esl
okay but my my baby well she had bad luck with me because she is going to say that i'm oldfashioned or that i know that she is not going to have a cell phone
new york has
at twelve or thirteen she is not going to walk up and down with a cell phone
oh yes but i i have seen what was like twelve thirteen you know they are entering seventh eighth grade and it seems like they're already
they want to be older so they put a lot of pressure on the parents and so the parents give it to them
and i don't believe in this
when she's seventeen then i will but her a phone and since
and this to ca call me
yes only her i am a single mother
and well she's the only one i have for now
if it's the same as those playstations and all that i say no no no
and i'm here in the city now
and it more or less begins and cold autumn comes there
hello
eh in october it usually starts or it feels more like autumn here but the cold
the real cold weather starts in december in january starts snowing and then we have cold days until april so
swe still have a little bit
mmm
of course it's the same here spring is really short sometimes you don't even notice it
cold and then heat
hey and where are you from
puerto rico
i was born her in new york but my family is cuban and well i also lived in chile so my spanish is a combination of things
mm
how do you say your name
i see
sure i am the same my parents always speak to me in english but my grandparents i was raised with my gransparents we all used to live with my grandparents
they would always speak to me in spanish and i would answer in english and i started to talk at about fourteen
sure sure at that age we feel it
and where you live before you went to puerto rico
where in north carolina ya ya
em well and the issue the issue that i heard was by cell telephones i don't know because at different times i have had conversations when the other person hears something different
but i do not know what is your opinion on cell phones if they are annoying
um
mm
auria hi i'm nicole
yes of course
yeah yeah obviously the problem is that there are people who do not have that courtesy
i have been in movies where the telephone rings in the restaurant where the people have one whether it is two people in a restaurant and one person is on the phone
or is yes it's an urgent thing obviously but i don't get the urgency
it can't be a lot so much urgency
clearly
clearly
um yes
um
um
nice to meet you how are you
um
um yes yes yes i agree absolutely i mean driving
sure but they should have their hands free because you really need to have your hands free while driving i see people
walking in the streets not paying attention because they are talking on the phone so imagine what happens while driving it's a lot worse you should have your hands free at least
to drive and also in hospitals one really shouldn't use them in hospitals because the signals can interfere with the machines of the the hospitals
one should turn off the phone in other places i mean it's a matter of being respectful towards other people
and also they should be respectful to the people you are with because you are with friends family and you answer the phone in the middle of a conversation it should be on important matters only it shouldn't be
when you are with a friend and then answer the phone to talk to another friend right
sure sure and the phone it's another thing that is supposed to help ease communication
but i think it makes it worse because you are constantly being interrupted by calls
good where are you
sure sure
computers
um
right
but i don't answer i mean if i'm with another person except for if it's something important or if i know it's going to be a short call to decide something or other but if i'm with someone i really i don't answer the phone
well i live alone so i have time when i'm alone to talk on the phone alone
and i i think that when i'm with other people i should be with that person i mean like it used to be when there were no cell phones when you talked on the phone in the house and not in the street
i mean i don't know it's a little it's like a mania that people have to always be available
i mean also with email i mean people have those blackberries and they're always available via email or to answer their emails and i don't understand how their email can be so urgent
that they can't answer them later when they're at home at the computer
aha what is the climate like there
um
um yea
um um
of course of course that make sense also now with the cellphones you can watch who is calling so i don't know i mean if i'm going to visit a friend
and my friend is calling well i answer because i know we agree for tomorrow
but if it is another person i can call him later or i don't know i mean it is about having common sense but people think that is always the other thing is that young people i'm a teacher young people
love the cellphones they always have them and always ring on the classroom i mean i don't know how many times they ring in my class
and i say they are in the school not to answer the phone but to learn
also they are with all his friends i don't know who is calling i mean you can imagine they are in high school but you can imagine most of
the young people in high school are their friends are also in the same school
eh i am from new york
i mean because this cellphones are calling are the parents calling i don't think so
um and what does she teach your mom
ok ok i teach english english to immigrants
esl so
no twenty or thirty no it's that many of my students already have it at seventeen eighteen they're old enough by then
um um
yes yes
yes
and you have only this daughter
already
yes
but good she is taken care of well
no it's not cold it's hot so far it's been super humid but but today is the first day that there hasn't been much moisture
good evening how are you im norma from here atlanta
ah well nope i don´t agree with people driving and talking on the phone it it dangerous they should not get distracted they can receive bad news
what do i know they are in shock and go to what do i know there are accidents for that
no but or is in another part another part the cellulars have became a necessity not for an emergency for something that happens and many times we can not find a telephone
close well at least they have a cellphone
and you what do you think
yeah
yeah
yeah
sure
sure that does not should not be or i agree if it is an emergency no
we meet again doesn´t we
and there isn't but when is something for example why do children need cell phones in school
no they go to study at school they don't go to talk to their friends they go to study
no and when you're driving it's really dangerous being you know driving and talking with your cell phone
yes it's good because how do they say they are not paying attention no but in other ways it's like convenient isn't it but it has it's cons and pros
of course
of course parents are the one who should educate their children how does people says education starts at home no
parents don't educate their own children they don't teach them good things and manners
or do things that are really appropriate then
neither the children don't go they won't learn they won't understand
hmm
aha
hmm
oh my god
aha
oh yes
aha
oh yes yes people nowadays
many times they are adicted to the cell phone
ah despite nothing happens they get their cell phone to look to search for someone to talk to
that's right
that's right for certain as i say emergencies isn't it
ah yes
really eh many times one does not need but many times there are things that one really does not need for instance there were no cells before cell phones that one
some years ago there weren't any cell phones there wasn't internet or something
and there one lived well you really did not lack anything
it is not yes as we live in a society with consumerism that is the reason
many times the advertising all that blurb i don't know
they make us think that we really need something that we don't we really don't need them
mhm
ah yes in the train
of course know pretty much everyone has a cellphone everybody goes with with their
cellphone talking talking there from there
mhm
no
uh um
oh yes
of course it's a kid right
oh of course
of course yes when we go to the temple our temple there too
no there's er people that have their cellphone and before the mass starts the reverend says please turn off your cellphone so they won't interrupt
yes some turn it off right but some don't they still
they have and sometimes sound right
oh yes really
how do you say
mm
oh okay
oh yeah
oh this can be true
yes in a few things right that's good right
but there is too much of an addiction
yes really
okay every day okay they call me i haven't made calls
yes i too i know but i no i
i don't they call me everyday because it's a limited amount of calls that you can make
yes yes
you can only do twenty five calls that's it
i i guess i don't know because to me yes
they always call me everyday since the study started
yes they call me everyday
and one day they did i don't know about two calls
well yesterday no not yesterday one friday i lost a call because i they called me but i wasn't here
here and they didn't call back
mhm
aha
well
hello my name is gloria
do you agree with people who drive and talk on the phone
oh they call you everyday oh i'm glad
oh i'm glad i'm glad
oh me too
aha
yes i lost i lost a few too but i told them i was in certain days and sometimes i'm not sometimes i'm
the answer machine is on and they leave a message for me there i lost the call and they sometimes call again and sometimes they don't
i tell them that i'm here late around eleven o'clock so they call me late sometimes they call in the evening
yeah
yeah yeah
i do not like it i do not talk and drive i i absolutely scream at people that drive and talk on the phone makes me crazy
because they do not put attention they are they are on the phone and are not putting attention yes yes he ate the light or did not eat the light o
o o he's arguing one time i was with my friend and her husband was arguing with her and i told her hold on hold on that you are going to put me you are going to kill me because you are arguing with him
and at times today children are using at schoolwe need to take away it is an annoyance in school the cellphones they lose them we need to look for them
we need to dial them they go crazy like if it was their last bill on their wallet ah and some times they do not respect do not respect their teachers
the teachers tell them to turn them off and they do not turn off they leave on vibrate it is childish very bad childish expecially at school
all this children and they lose it they lose it we collect like twenty or twenty five cellphones even though we tell them not to bring to school
oh fine and you
they still bring them
they still bring them
exactly
exactly
yes
exactly
yeah right you know someday i spoke to other mom and i told her you know you should not send him with his cell phone
oh but that s the way i communicate with him and i told her he can use the office phone whenever he wants
yes it is an emergency you call here and we look for him
she told me no but do you think that i bought that cell phone to be in the top of a dressing table but i told her look
aha last night i talked with another lady a lady that dreamed as you but she was from philadelphia
then i will tell the principal to start taking it away from him because one of the school rules is not to bring
not to bring the cell phone and you're sending him with a cell phone you are guilty of the corrections and even that you don't correct him you should correct him well
really well that way they won't do it again
oh yeah yeah
yeah
aha
exactly yeah
ehm let me see what else i am so tir tired i had two parties this weekend and i am dead tired and and leave me and you that is a
i am going to tell you yesterday i had a party
and and she called me that i would come later really then i could not find the place she would continue calling she called me no i am going to tell you about fifteen
her name was silvia and we talked about the same thing we talked about the cell phone
times in less than three minues
and i let the cell phone ring i said i am not going to let this this woman that is causing me to me an accident
so that i would get to her light quickly and anyway i was close to her house and she told me to go to the other side
yes after i was two blocks from her house he told me no it is on the other side and after that i come another time i say i am not going to pay attention to her
i am going by the directions the directions that i have on the internet
and i arrive very well i say the next time i won't even call her because she was driving me crazy with the damn cell phone
oh my god
yes yes yes
yes yes it is true my husband my husband says ay always i am not going to buy you that new cell phone because you always leave it here
what are you thinking you must carry it with you as if it were your wallet and i say i am not carrying it as if it were my wallet because
yes
me my my child is the most important thing for me and he is at school and if something happens to him there they call me
and if something happens to you the ambulance calls me for what reason do i have to carry the cell phone if when we saw an accident one time on the highway
you know then it was handy
yes yes yes
i know true
exactly
yes
right
yes yes exactly and how they do the lpo is another thing
that every boy has to have that music noise in the airs and all that oh my god and in the movies even in the cinema he said that we have to talk that
and you remember the cell phone number
that they use it in the cinema in the cinema they also make a lot of noise and they ruin the movie when you go to the cinema
ya i don't go i am tired of hearing all the world talk in their cellphones in the cinema they are in the train too in the train like
its their home
one hears all the conversation of the the one that is close to you or in front of you
i don't like it there i don't like my cellphone i put it in vibrate and whoever calls me has to wait until i
leave the train i am very obsessive my friends say hey gloria what is up with you look you go the highway
you are going at fifty and you are talking i don't think you can you are losing pendent to the conversation i find it very rare because when i
i don't get on the highway but when i do i have to put it in my head that i can't be talking with someone
in the phone oh my god it drives me crazy the phone that cellphone makes me crazy
i know
we have to talk about the cell phone
i know i know i don't let my boy take it to school he has it for emergencies
then he/she says to me mom but what if there's an emergency and i tell him/her you go and since i work at a school they'll let you call me
they know you're my son
they'll let you call me you know but we restrict the phone to everyone so the cellphones won't be used and still
they don't listen and you tell them not to use them and they're on the hallway they go into the bathroom
at the hallway they go behind the door oh these kids now are horrible horrible ¡oh my god horrible even in church today at church a poor lady
her cellphone rang like it was a door bell and even the priest stopped when he was praying and said what's that a door
and he said it like a joke
and he did it like a joke but then he said that when you go to church is to pray not to ask for your cellphone ringing
so she felt bad and she went outside and afterwords when she left her cellphone started ringing again and and everybody everybody started to laugh
from the cell phones
because this lady was i said aw leave already interrupting the concentration that you have at church you know so
right
right and people still doesn't turn it off right
some of them turn it off
i know what a lack of respect right
just ike adults do not pay attention so it is that children do no pay attention neither
because they follow the role of their mom and dad you know i'm so tired now i i am helping my baby with his job
we are writing he has to write eight sentences about cell phones as to why he has a cell phone and if he can live without a cell phone and if he you can use it in the cinema
if you can use it when you go to a dance if this if it is also used to play now i use the cell phone as a calculator
because i can use it as a calculator and and oh the other good thing it has i put my appointments in my cell
and do you like it
yes the only bad thing with that is if i do not find the phone until after i forget the homework and i put that so when i remember that
today i have an appointment in this case it is good yes
yes i'm with the
i know
anyway i keep talking and i'm tired oh my god have you called a lot have you received a lot of calls or have you called or do they always call you

ah information
yes it is good to always have them handy but
yes and internet can be very useful and also can be very bad because as you said good and bad information also no
oh about pornography and all that yes
yes
yes so you have to be wise but
but it is incredible to communicate with somebody or learn anything
yes
and like you said the encyclopedias you can have access to so many things
yes
it's true and more over now that i am here i never cooked a lot when i was younger
and now it's like i get a recipe for emapanadas and whatever you go to get one and and get recipes

hello good night i am lorena
of using interent and at the end it says his opinion and talks about meeting new people thought this means
no yes yes it's yes yes
sure
yes me neither and finally i i underst i don't understand that word
i i press the four because i understand that it's a no that it's a phone without a wire a wireless
i hope that's it if not well at the end i passed the test approved and they pa they tell me ant then listen and do you have much family in chile all your family members
by phone that i have been very well positively i have really liked it see i never thought i would be so much fun
so interesting well just three or four people
but it's like an adventure to tell you the truth
from mexico mexico city
and you
ah from chile chilean pasties are delicious
sure
yes in mexico city when my husband was studying for his masters
there was th since it was the latin american academy of social sciences
paulina how are you
there were students from all latinareis and then well there were always times that we were invited by eh a chilean friend an argentinean friend to eat some of their dishes no
all those pastries wow how to forget them
yes yes yes yes and where are you calling from
georgia i'm in san antonio texas
how long have you been here
yes eleven years and how just two years
yes well when you first got here did you came to study or how
mhm
ah that's good that's nice right
aha two years because we were waiting for our kids to finish their middle education too
i was going to ask you the same because i can't listen well i think it was clear loud i understood from the internet
mhm in mexico they finished middle school and they are here in high school
yes yes and this
i have two they are with me now and an older one that is studying at the universityshe has been out of the house before
and she has been studying two years in pennsylvania
yes she is studying chemical engneering
yes and she works very much what barbara but well good there there this needs to be what do you study
oh how nice microbiology that one i like very much much
yes yes yes yes yes i studied anthropology and also for english teacher
mhm and i was a teacher in mexico
but but definitely the situation here in the sense of salary and other is much much better also i have family here in
of the
in san antonio then well so they were
giving things yes yes yes yes do you already have a child
ohhh
yes yes so you aren't working at the moment
certainly and enjoying it as well
yes listening is a good way to use the time
so how many people have you met in this way
the same thing happened to me several timestwo or three
the call connects or it doesn't connect
yes if nobody is on the other side exactly
no but it was clear that i was paying attention
oh right
yeah but this is interesting right i mean i didn't understand the
at first and now that i have been talking it's really
you recover the importance of speaking right
because in this life with so much hurry and with all those racing and occupations well sometimes you don't even call yous friends on the phone to say hi or to see how they're doing right
but then you have to value what's important
yes yes yes yes yes
but spending a few minutes washing the dishes for example to call over the phone it's always kind of it's important
right right
yes
and you couldn t really listen
aha
yes and this internet well yes that is another question but well it is a wonder
ey not me but my children especially the youngest girl she is always on it
and the most important thing is that computers are a wonder no
like they make information access easier
and the poor paper encyclopedias well they are now decoration articles
yes yes yes they are very pretty
bad information no everything that is known about about
exactly what a terrible thing no yes yes yes yes
yes
this and of all the points he was making before i picked up the call the last thing i understood were the advantages
yes or somebody in chile could send you an email or something like that right
also those parents
yes yes yes you get in and you put this cooking recipe to a medication to a natural remedy
to microbiology physics whatever there is is right
yes okay
aha sure and they turn out easy right and and i remember that
yeah that the other day for the pumpkin pie right around halloween time
no man well there was like thirty five different recipes
well choose one and prepare it
yes and how is it
i understan which are the most important dates in his life and which aren't
yes no through this medium we have been meeting the phone calls and everything
aha well yes i have really liked the truth it has been novel to me it's incredible
that well that they are like introducing again that the phone is useful and it's important no
to speak to people
my daughter at the university of pennsylvania
yes you too
aha
ah ok
that was good listen speaking about that
the other day i had to speak to a man that lives in new york but that his parents are puerto rican
what are the advantages and disadvantages
its so hard to understand i don't have a problem with you you're talking to me and like they dont say words or letters properly
and they talk to fast and when i work they say sir you should start calling right
no i mean the one from the plan
to talk to someone the knows spanish
yes
yes
no yes yes yes or for example when they say wait on the line
it's like saying i already forgot for now hold on
yes yes yes yes
well it's good that you said that i haven't said it i've only thought about it
good night my name is i live in connecticut
ah
the conversation is about the internet you use it internet
mhm
aha aha
mhm
yes it is good a m i use it to look for work to search for information for the school girl but for
things to search for people on the internet i don't like it
i don't believe in in that of i believe that you meet there are many crazy a lot of a lot of trash such that that put you on the internet and
there are many people who have used it and and have married and all but i i have never gotten a
in the chat rooms those who say
oh miami ah ah and how are you
i have never talked with anyone
it wasn't true
yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah
and that tra that also that has bring a lot of troubles to couples i found
because it break apart a lot of couples that husbands get into or the woman get into the internet and meet people and they they spend hours and hours and hours and hours lost in it in this internet
i don't i use it like that but my niece sends me pranks and sends me jokes from puerto rico and and mi son sends me the pictures of the baby girl the new baby girl that's why i like very much the service
because i can see my granddaughter at any time and and know how is she every month
yeah yeah
yes the pictures are is is something beautiful but also eh what i don't like too much they were saying that you know that you send your pictures and they keep them in something like a
fine thanks and the baby sleeping
file for some times so after after that i think after six months or something like that the they delete them the the
the program deletes them if you haven't taken them out yet
oh well when i don't i usually don't leave them in the computer i place them on a cd
and i date it and we put a label in it and i keep them like that if some relatives show up then we play them on the television or in the computer
aha aha yes because if you leave them in the computer they take up a lot of space i believe
aha
mhm
aha
aha yeah
yes
must be resting at least
yes you can ca but you have to i think to to program the cd for whatever to watch it on the tv so you buy a cable i think for the camera and
and you have it it on the te on the television that's what we do every time we have a party well we play it
on the cd afterwards when our family comes by we pla we get together and everyone seats on the living room and they they watch it eh on television it looks better
because it's a bigger screen too and if you add music
well it it looks nice that's why i like the the internet but for the other ones of of a couple it doesn't take
no but look at all those kids that sometimes they take that is that that they meet those crazy people on the internet
he here there was a girl that is that a guy fooled and no from new jersey ah that he was about forty something years old and how old was the girl she was fifteen
and he took her good luck that they could catch her but god knows if he had taken her and killed her and i don't like much either for the thing about the kids sometimes
it's a separate room that you use as an office
mhm mhm
oh that's good
yeah
yes they when you go they change the screen what do you do well my grandchildren sometimes i tell them what are you doing no nothing here
and i open the other screen that they have there to see
but you need to be very vigilant because the computer is a bit it has many advantages but also some disadvantages
because look at all this information that it sometimes provides so that these these terrorists make bombs even these students that that killed those people at columbine school
they took their ideas from the i the internet so sometimes i mean it has its its good side like everything like all the things that they come up with that have some good points and then it has other points that well
are disastrous as well
aha aha
yes no now well now they have invented many things of parental control and all that stuff that
that at leas you well you can control them with that a little bit more than before but at first when there was none of that well you know the little boys went into the chat rooms uh they opened twenty thousand stuff
i was watching a program on tv the program that i like to watch on wednesday's
um
oh it's that there's people that uh when i think that if you leave the the password and you don't close the when you go to see your email
if you don't close it right quickly oh let's suppose you you go to cook or something and you leave it there in open space
a lot of there are a lot of men that a lot of people that know hoy to get your get your password from that moment when you're leaving it for for a long time that's why it tells you that as soon
as you're leaving the computer well you go and close it you understand to ensure that no one will get your information well so what they do when they got your password they come and they start sending
these emails that that sometimes what they bring is viruses sometimes it's dirty stuff
so it all depends on i mean at least you should be very careful with the with the passwords and with information specially the bank and all that
sometimes when they ask for information that they ask you to put your pin again because
you have to be very careful there
right
oh me too from the allergy but apart from that well i have taken vitamins to calm
oh yeah well that's identity theft well that's been happening a lot in
in the middle of the internet they rob everything your your your personality that is why when you know that sometimes they tell you to grab what do i know what is free what they offer twenty million things free in the internet and you know you'll start to fill them out and then
when they start asking your information like like that last name of your mother date of birth and all those things well it's not good to give that information
oh
no
hello
but
anyway i n
this is like i use it every day there we eh you know we have email we have eh eh we to all that we have to do with the bank
i search for information recipes go to the library
i don't buy much but if i go to buy something i always do eh a research
eh searching for products to see where i get the best price so the internet for us is is is like you know having an
encyclopedia we say
at home
no a m neither do i
because i
this is annie in miami we talked
yes eh and
i before eh get into the the chat rooms but they were not you know to meet people or whatever they were about different topics
but no it was nothing eh you know after some time doesn't like me because the people were like p n i don't know they said things that
that l
si or or things that usually don't say you know as it get ugly
and i didn't like at all so after some time like one or two months i stop going but because i prefer talk with the people no you know
be there a in in front of a machine
but you know i have one
yes
yes is that is something that we also do we take pictures of the girl and we send them to all the friends our friends and every well not every month now but before was every month
fine and you
and that's what like very much because in that way at least the people that we know the family that is far from us can see how is she growing up
yes that's is that is something that we do a lot i forgot the pictures
well my kid is almost two years old now and we've never we've never gone through that the pictures are still there i think it depends you know
in what you are using we have pictures in the internet we have some from my baby shower
ah very smart aha
ah that's great that's a good idea
well i always have them copied before before i upload them to the computer
oh i'm sorry in the internet i always get a copy in a cd and all that stuff
so that's how i have the originals that we took we take around one hundred every month
but i upload lets say around thirty or forty so i keep the originals and the ones that i uploaded to the internet because those are the ones that
is well yes thanks god
you know i've fixed the better ones so i always have two types of cds so yes when she grows up if she wants to have the pictures i can put them on and say look these are the best ones and these are the original ones pick the ones you like
so she will have them but
i had never thought about playing it on the the television
yes
mhm eh eh yes that's a good idea
yes
me me neither and and that too like you said before that you know you never know who you're going to meet
yes
me neither yes that's something else that that i already know that when you know my son is more more let's say older that the computer will
i i will have to move it from the room that it's in because right now we have it in a not in the office but let's say that's what we're calling it
yes now i put it to sleep
and
yes but i want to put it let's say in the living room or you know in a place where they can can use it and i can see
everything that they are doing because since i used to be a teacher i know you know what what what kids do
how they hide from their parents and things like that and not tha
i don't want to say that my s
yes it
so that
ah
yes
it all depends how you use it you know yes that but no i i i love the internet but i also know when
and how are you
you know if one starts to n no if one starts but when kids start using it you have to do it a bit differently
you know because i believe that many times they don't
yes
and well and that still it happens even if it has parental controls because many times when i go to to look my email you know i know that this happened to to some of my students that they go to open their email
and there are pictures of you know of of naked women or whatever
and and that's something that that upsets me very much that i don't know how can you change that do you know
right
yeah
no thank god we you know stuff like that on the computer it hasn't happened to us but someone did steal the the number of of
social security
ay that's good i'm starting to feel a cold i have a sore throat very bad
of my husband a while back and we had a lot of trouble
why
that's what it says but i'm pregnant and i can not take many things
so i'm you know im not feeling well today
hello good evening uh i'm nicole i'm calling from new york
from the telesales i don't like it i don't know who likes it
that people call us to sell any eh i don't know
eh i don't believe that they are talking when they call you
that when they call you on the phone and they sell you stuff and also when
when they send you emails
ven of course spam
so i don't know i don't know if that convinces anyone i have never bought anything or looked any email seriously
i don't know and
yes i eh bought things via internet but no
of course
hello how are you
of course of course well it must be it must be effective
it should be that someone sees those emails and is convinced if not
um
sure
mhm sure
don't know is yes yes ah intend to use those lists they say do not call
or is there like you can enroll to a list and with supposedly do not call your number but i don't know
i am enroll and the same they call me at times
but not as much not as much as before
um i always say i say a no like what like i can not talk now can not talk now and i hang up for not i really do not want to listen to the story that they will tell me because i know i will not
good good did we talk before or no
i'am not going to buy
mm
yes yes that too
yes
yes it has to be an awful job my sister did that like a week or so
and she was coming home crying because all the people
right no no one wants to listen like
like all the people hang you and she was coming like that upset and she left in a week
no besides the pressure you when you have a job like that and with all the pressure ah
ah you have to sell and they listen to you while you call the manager listens to you
no no i spoke with someone from atlanta
and see how you are going and if you're not
of course and if you're not effective or they pay you a lot less i feel a little sorry for people
of course of course like they are also trying to earn money but i don't want to go them money that's the problem
i don't know what it is i respond the enquiries like they call me with enquiries so what do they want to know
that if i'm going to vote for anyone and who im voting for i don't know i think that the political situation right now that makes the enquiries understandable
i think that's its good that they have different opinions
and i like to contribute with something like that because its like an investigation for
of course but they're asking me for money just answers i can give opinions not money
of course of course i also don't want to have what their selling to me i mean i read news on the internet
and i don't want diaries in my house
but i don't know
uh and i don't know what else they sell life insurance i dont want that
mhm you won a car
that you just have to go to miami to find it
of course
of course not the most part of those things
it's all know how to wing money because if it was not for that they would not be winning
someone has to pay those people's salary
mm of course that is the other thing that tometimes
they call and say they have they leave a message and say you must call a certain number so get your price
and the number ends up being a a number that charges you money for calling them
what country are you from
or rather is like those number ninehundred a ninehundred that charge money for calling them so then
mm
i think that it is cheap i mean i think that it is cheap for the company to do this kind of publicity i mean they probably pay very little
to to the people who are calling
in fact sometimes those people who are calling are not even in the united states
but they have like communication systems
that allows people to call you from india
and you can't tell the way they speak english in india
i mean like they do like outsourcing
like they pay people in those countries to call you to sell you stuff can you imagine
a ya uh
how little they must pay those people
they are making the calls that way that if they make one or two sales per person they are still making money i mean they do it because of that because they can not
i mean they must not sell much like that but since they pay so little to their employees they must earn a bit because of that
of course because it is a poor country
yes i heard that sometimes when you call help desk with a question about your computer or something like that when you call for help many times the people that answer are from india
mhm
of course sometimes the communication is really bad
sure or sometimes because there is a lag it's like they don't listen and they don't listen
in the end what happens to the communication if i'm calling the phone company and the communication is bad but it is because they are far away so
incredibly to think like that because they are also in a different time it should be twelve hours difference in india
i well my family is cuban
sure o o work at night
that people should call more during the day than at night here so those people must be calling at night or working at night there
so let's say it is three in the evening here
how great i don't know i don't know em maybe i don't know i mean maybe it is worth it for those people maybe it is better than the other jobs there
of course it is a bit to talk too much about this subject that like sometimes the subjects you get
there isn't much to say
yes
fechar that was for translating from english
it's a machine that translates from english to spanish
fechar me too i was listening that fechar what could be fechar
uh but i was born over here in the united states
after from spanish fecha fechar could be go out with a girl
what small mistake like in a language study
is is supposed that this is a linguistic study
and they can't really translate the words to spanish
hello good evening
oh okay and so what is your opinion about the nol
yes
no it is it refers to to to it refers to telemarketing those that show up pop ups via internet or that that they call on the telephone
ah when they call you on the phone
ah
ah smap yes
aha
yes
ah me neither i don't believe that that that i have bought thing via internet i have not bought stuff on the internet online
but not from what they send on spam
oh i'm norma here from atlanta georgia
no no other things that one really needs no
no and
yes sure sure their are people that invest that is why they like this e get worried to send all those emails and the
and small business o i don't know who does that then they invest your money doing that
sure no and that by phone yes by phone it really bothers eespecially one is busy
yeah annoying
yeah
yes certain that yes
mhm yes sure yes no at times no and the persons that sell are very persistant sometimes
yeah
fine and you
of course i'am not interested
if sometime you have people and other times you have like they say scams that call you to sell you something and sometimes the ending is some obscure you have cases like that
illegal stuff they offer
they offer selling you through phone or internet too
ah yes yes lot of families were employed
no one wanted to buy
yes not even listen
right not a really good job it's not doesn't reward you too much it makes you miserable
right
yes
um i don't know
they pay her a commission definitely
yes sometimes one thinks its no good good to do a job like any other kind of job right
mhm mhm
ha
mhm
of course
mm like research
of course now nobody will know who they really are to be honest who is lying
yes
insurance vacations

yes that that is truly
yes or that he won that but must sent an amount of money to assure your prize
a matter
mhm
of course
yes they really have to be careful and not
no
yes
mm
oh on top everyone must pay the long distance yes you must be very careful besides that no but many people paying because they want more business
mhm
no that for a form of publicity that they say
yes
a yes yes that is true
mmh
a yes exactly
yes the accent they have
aha
um
clearly because in india they don't pay very much because of that
well because in india it is a way of life completely different and yes you pay pay less to the people
i i am peruvians
yes so those people are anxious to work in whatever job no
yes yes it is true here the big for example the big telecomunications enterprise from here south bell south
no and always sometimes my wife calls i call for some problem with the telephone with the internet that we have and yes yes the people that you call that answer are in india
no yes mhm sure and you sometimes don't understand because they don't speak
mhm mhm

i assume there are people that work that i don't know maybe all the time no
o work yes work at night
yes more or less mhm
of course well to see what else we say so the twelve minutes go by
and you
mhm
right like the last time when they called for the dates thing
they called to fechar
yes it's an
it's an question not an issue i said what is fechar

of course and you eat so many delicious things as a vegetarian you have nothing to envy
oh yes
mmm
oh i see
well they don't talk that much of spanish they know some words they understand quite a bit of spanish but not too much
yes it's not that difficult i try to teach them spanish but hey talk english at high school

oh there you go
oh aren't you married
ah aham
oh ok
oh there's where he is isn't it at
oh you see i'm fortyone
good and then we spoke yesterday right
hmm
the adequate person does no appear
mhm
mhm
mhm
yes he is still young
yes well when someone gets married it's different it's
no and one has more obligations
it's not the same liberty as before especially if you have kids
mhm
oh okay yes yes
clearly yes this is true but on hold or at least not not yet this is decided
no next to of a few more of your or to reserve a bit more of your freedom i suppose it must be that way no
yes
mhm
mm
oh that is right you are correct
when the the kids are small they are babies and oh no one does not even have time to eat or even bathe
ok
oh yes a baby
of course the babies are like that exactly mhm
yes yes i think we did talk
no that is right when the kids are still very small one needs to be with them all the time
oh my children are one is seven and the other one is three
yes they're still very young too
they're children right and
yeah
sure of course enjoy enjoy while you can and
sure because if you don't you
yes he is american he is a brunette american
i married a he's also he just lives in the temple
he's from the same religion so we met there
yeah
oh i'm from the hare krishna movement
i don't know if he has heard
mhm
mhm yes yes we are vegetarians there aren't any
oh yeah there's many temples in peru around the world as well
oh yes of course
they are vegetarian since they'e born
no no they are
not until now when they were little we taught them to be vegetarian
yeah so they don't really ask anything and when they are teenagers that's when they'll start i dont know nobody will make them do something they dont want right
yeah
they aren't kids anymore they can choose they're own things when they grow up
no they have to choose or they have to see
ah yes mm
mm
ah
ah yes
aha
when they eat a lot
mm
sure is healthier no
yes that's what i was thinking about
is healthier and even better for digestion
mhm
no no we do not eat meat eggs or fish
no and are you still with the same boyfriend
oh well now maybe another another boyfriend suggest maybe is does not like to eat meat and make him vegetarian is much easier you are vegetarian
mhm
yeah
really
yeah
yeah
of course because no i don't think anyone would agree with telemarketing
well some people look tilted well it´s like a habit they were born born like that didn´t they
grew up eating meat and they don´t know to there is another alternative no it depends did you hear something but it´s that that never imagined how it is like did the
because being a vegetarian it really has nothing to do there´s nothing to envy people who eat meat i´m vegetarian i don´t eat meat since twenty yeas ago
no and and you really feel very good it´s healthier no not even doesn´t look her age
she is vegetarian
no but it´s different right
sure it´s very he it´s very heavy for digestion it´s that the human body is not used to it right to eating and eating meat it´s not carnivorous
yes because it´s that really when you start being vegetarian you don´t know how to fee balance your nutrition
of course not i mean you also have to eat and look for proteins that are going to tone no
find i don´t fin that does not eat meat in
hello
no and are you from peru
mmm
mmm
of course and milk and yogurt and that all
oh i see
of course you get used to it
of course i like it i also like many indian music which has many vegetarian dishes
asian food in general i really like it
chinese and japanese food i really like eating fish
but what else was i going to ask you i had other question but i forgot it do you children speak spanish or english
of course but because you speak english with your husband
ah and how long have you lived here
mmm
mmm
ten years do you have family here
aha
ah yeah
and wine or girl or adult
mm yeah yeah and you do that in atlanta
mhm
ah yeah
that's good
hello good evening i am nicole from new york
yeah
how many children are them
two sons what
oh yeah
yeah i can guess i spent my childhood with my sister i mean both of us girls so
i don't know how are they
no not yet
and i live i live by myself but near to my parents
hmm
i'm twentyseven years old
hello how are you
yeah no i i mean i'd love to have a family get married and have a family but
i don't know at the moment no
no it's the same i don't know my boyfriend the same we get along well perhaps
but we have been together for a year
so we are waiting a little
but perhaps yes i hope so
yes the same as
clearly
clearly
clearly clearly no i like to live alone sometimes yes it's a little bit lonely since i like to go out do things
no not yesterday because yesterday i did not make any calls we spoke before
see other people but if now it's too lonely but i don't know everything has it's time i believe
of course
of course because because it is a lot of work and when one has a family that is a lot of work
and myself and myself i like to be alone it is like i tell you i like i like the quite times i like to think and read
i think when when i have children
oh it is going to be very difficult to do those things
so what
of course of course i went to visit a friend of mine who has a daughter
the daughter is like six weeks old
that is small and i do not know my friend with with with the baby always that is she does not leave her
but the topic i do not remember any more or maybe the topic about the telemarketers
that is she is with her at every single moment but no she she is very happy but it is a huge responsibility until the grow up a little
uh and how old are your uh children
oh i see
sure of course
how cute to have to have children i mean having a family is i believe the best of life
i don't know maybe in a few years from now i'll leave i'll dedicate myself to peacefulness
sure
and your your husband uh did you meet him here on the united states
i see
ok
yes we spoke i think it was friday
ok and what religion is that
oh yea look yea
yea i studied in the in the university i studied buddhism that
its like the same thing right
what about in peru is there hari krishna as well there should be
mm and are the kids vegetarian as well right
oh
and do they ask for meet
no
of course
we spoke about the same topic how stupid
of course mm
sure sure
yes i was a vegetarian for many years
i was a vegetarian for about ten years but then i went to chile i was living with a boyfriend over there and really it was hard to keep on being a vegetarian because
because he ate meat and if i prepared vegetarian stuff
he would put like a piece of meat in the middle like he didn't want to eat like that
so i left him i left him there because he was like very complicated and then when i returned and i continued but i don't eat much meat like
i never cook meat in the house only
sure if i eat out or if i go to someone else's house and they make something there yes but in the house only vegetables and legumes
i like mm i prefer eating like this
what else are we going to say
i mean
mm
mm yes the truth is that i do not like meat much i like fish better
i don't know do you eat fish or not
no not fish but meat in fact i don't like it anymore
no no we broke up
if you have never been in a relationship with a vegetarian never
and and i have had like 5 boyfriends
like serious boyfriends
oh rather more or less serious
well lets talk about something else because what are we going to say we are not going to have the same conversation as before
but all eat meat and they liked meat even the one right now also
he likes the hamburgers and chicken
mm sure
mmm
mmm
sure
yes right to me i i prefer it because
the meat makes me feel full like heavier
mmm but people that are used to eating meat uhh like they feel hungry when they don´t eat meat
mmm sure you don´t have to worry about about about having proteins
hy how are you aha we want to talk of what i didn't understand perfectly the
aha because i am in a list of i don't know if you know that a list that you put you name on it
with the government and they can't call you i think that list exists but i don't know where
they are able to send me but they are not able to call me
the unwanted call list began around two years and a half because the people had complaints
because they were calling you in your nap time and all of it so i put my name in that list
not to ask but if i don't pay my bills they call me
yes if i don't pay my bills they call me and also something is going to happen with the email
i don't know if you have a computer but if you have one they send you a lot there
ok
mm
aha i had the phone have to get me another phone because this one can't increase the volume and have to change it
and where are you from how many years do have here in the usa
wow one year what country are you from oh you are from spain oh yes because i am a hispanic from latin america
yes but in panama panama is very commercial even for a small country do you understand
yes but panama is much more advances than costa rica yes yest there is much
oh yes huh
yes yes but puerto rico is the most democratic country in the america continent yes
it doesn't have the military and all it's politics the politics in costa rica is more peaceful of all
i'm telling you the truth when i say that in the us we have different political parties and every year one is in power or they are in power for 23yrs and then another party and they do this perfectly well
without military the government is unable to use force do you understand
many people do not know that in panama our businesses are more advanced
ah yes i heard you right but i didn't heard the machine before
you will see people from different countries at the panama canal from all over the world lot's of people go there
working with the ships right the big ships how do you say junk ship and ship right and they wanted to stay they stayed in panama
and they didn't go back to their country so it's a lot of people who couldn't leave right and had political problems in their country and when they arrive when they're working on the ship
when they get to panama you know how do you say they get off the ship and blend with panamanian people
ah like three thousand the whole country has three thousand
yes it's a tiny country a country that's well developed for business for business yes
yes very small it only has three thousand pesos three thousand people but not three millions not three thousand three millions no oh oh oh what am i saying three millions i'm sorry
no three millions three millions no no it's three millions not three thousand because a friend of mine was here in brooklyn in new york and i was in a business library
a business library and i looked at the yellow books phone numbers in spain you know what a yellow book is a yellow book is phone numbers phone numbers yes
the yellow pages the yellow pages for all spain was not as big as brooklyn's and brooklyn is a tiny part of the usa you know what i mean ah the city of new york has five boroughs right
yes yes right speaks spanish with an american accent got me
brooklyn one of the boroughs and the whole pages for spain wasn't
yes yes about thirty years but but if i have more than thirty years here yes yes i have many years here and i am more americanized than latino
very good too the thing that depends on the person and
the education and the people that you're with all of the time understand because if you have gone to the university or something like that you still continue speaking in a certain manner understand because i am going to tell you the truth
uh i have a professor a teacher here from right i went to brooklyn college she was the a teacher of a teacher of of spanish of teaching spanish
but her class was about spanish literature understand like don quijote lazarillo of tormes and all that
and i don't remember lazarillo of tormes the first the first picaresque novel
the thing that she that is the worst teacher i've had in my whole life and she learned spanish from the book not by speaking at home
like the machine the machine that you heard but she speaks it better than the machine you see but she knew spanish very well it's just that she had to study so much about spain that when the moors had entrails and all that
she had to visit certain how do you say it in new york we have a museum right
right the things is that the spanish language has lots of words too and ah not only that but
where the architecture of spain is taught a lot go and the influences that the moors have had uh on the influence of spain is and we have certain words like the word hopefully is arabic yes
yes because when i tell you ojalá i hope we go to the movies tomorrow right
ojalá but what i'm telling you is oalá about the god allah do you see but speaking about all that telemarketing and spam you say you don't get a lot
no no email right oh please oh believe me oh i get it via i have yahoo what do you have
oh please
and not only horrible but those people are really how do you say in english right i'm practically telling you they're really creative
they know how to write things that you'll want to read
or tell you things that you'll want to look at i tell you they're really ah
imagination yes they have a good imagination
yeah
from different countries regions that call things differently you understand i am here in new york and i was talking to
ohh oh millions oh no
ah no oh and look that has increased a lot in the last six months ah
there has been a large increase in that previous it says that i won something in england and that i have to go to england to claim my thousand pesos or dollars what they have and that oh forget about it
but they say yes yes
for me they send many of those they send them from another country and they send like two thousand right two million
and the expect that one or two people you get me
yes eh incredible that they say one tells me that if the man has like fifty thousand pesos if they don't answer
fifty thousand fifty million and not the cont and i that that that they are crazy and they are from many countries they say and many they say are from nigeria nigeria and eh eh
aha
oh
some puerto ricans and they call the orange like
but and the thing eh i don't think that the government can like to know can't know who is the person that's sending who is what they are sending that
yes and also the thing that when they send all those letters yes eh it's difficult when well it says eh well you know that what they are trying to get your boys you understand the money but
china yes i would never accept that even if a chinese person that comes from china
a woman but that is colloquial then their spanish isn't that much only okay we were talking about telemarketing right
hy good good i'm laiya
aha ahh
ok legally they are not able to send you unwanted publications
oh they are not able to call you ok ok
mhm mhm
and they don't call you it really works ok
sure that's ok if they call you for that
ok ok
yes yes well i just have one year living in usa then i believe the marketing companies don't know me then they don't call to sell me stuff
and by mail some things but not to much my problem is my email i have many email accounts
from the private university i erase daily around fifty publicity emails
ah yes we have to talk about spam unwanted commercial publicity telemarketing and such sometime if they call you at home not to sell you things or they send you mail or email that kind of stuff
watches pills treatments and all that stuff
i've only been here for one year alone yes i am from barcelona spain
yes yes yes then oh from panama that's very good indeed
yes i was in costa rica i was relatively close to panama i was in costa rica last year

yeah yeah
aha very good yes yes haha
you can't hear me well

wow only three thousand wow so small so tiny
wow how small yes yes
ah ah ah okay okay okay three thousand i mean it's smaller than my town okay three millions is not a lot but yes three millions makes more sense
yeah yeah
yes yes the yellow pages yes yes
is that and beside that the machine speaks spanish pretty badly
yes yes yes there are a lot of people
uh huh uh huh and you have many years here

and is asking for help to get out those millions and that also
yes yes yes
ah yes yes also yes yes i ask myself if someone really believes in those stories no
because i don't know it seems incredible that someone could bite but if they send them is that someone i don't know someone bites
yes yes yes sure
yes yes yes nowadays there's no effort in sending an email to millions of people i mean that but i don't know i think it's incredible that someone could bite
yes yes yes yes yes some stories some impressive stories
yes yes yes from nigeria and also like i am in university we organize conferences
so there are people that register for the conference and they they ask like money to come well some stories so complicated that sometimes you don't know if people are true or it's a lie i mean with that of the internet
mja china
sometimes you don't know if if you're talking to someone real or if they're completely pulling your leg it's
ah yes it's that it's complicated because it's so easy to hide your identity not that
mja

yeah
yeah
yeah
hello
ah look what part of new york
um
in what part of new york
to in
yes
yes
i don't like that
and you uhm
yes me neither me neither i think that it is always a bother that is more than anything
yes it must be that is it must be that they make money with that because if not they wouldn't do it
that is
hello
uhm
what
um
no no there must be people that sometimes i think that people who are alone like maybe older people if they're alone and
and like they like to talk
they could like start a conversation also sometimes older people like they're like more confused like they can
they can convince them a little more
but i also think that the majority of the young people i don't know now i don't know there must also be young people that can be convinced but i think that very busy people they don't want to waste their time in
in having a conversation like that
to i mean they're in my email all the spam goes to like a different folder
eh i am nicole from new york
the email does that automatically
yeah that's it i don't even look at it i don't even open that folder it's like it's always there and it's the website itself deletes it after thirty days or something
hardly ever sometimes yes sometimes i go and see but ya n because hundreds arrive for example now there are two hundred and fifty and no like i get bored looking
um yes
maybe in the spam
sure
yes
how good how good what service you use
what email you use
em yes good i never open spam emails but i check the list like to see if someone if another person has called but no
and you nicole
em do not open because i believe that
um yes
yes that is what they say of course i don't know if that really happens i think that you have to open the email and also open the attachment like a
a file you have to open something they send with the email
because if not i don't think that they can send a virus like that just for having sent the email
ok that's better
um
yes yes
if they are selling and also i mean like pornographic things
i don't know pills
nicole
hu
uh
well there must be people that let themselves group for those things the simply let them themselves
i don't knowi met a women that believes those emails that says that someone from the government
needs help and that if you help them with money they would muliply the mount you gave them
yes she always believes that i think she isn't alright she is a little bit crazy or something but she always believes
she always believes and she has lost a lot of money
yes it's true or that other thing about selling things that not so many people buys but they told you that
you are going to make the money many people sends the money hoping they are going to receive more i think there is a lot of people dreaming about that
yes
nicole nicole no no it is not a spanish name
yes you are right but there's still people believing in those things
there are the only ones in the world of getting a profit from there people want to dream about that
it's like gambling people gamble thinking in getting a big profit out of it even when everybody loses
of course but there is always people who think that gambling will make them rich
and good good with betting some will win money there should be some but few
right
right or poker too a little or not
yeah poker i think ha it's like
poker's like psychological because you have to seem like you have more than you have or less than you have i don't know
it's like all a game that way then
what is your name
of course um
right no no this is like
right
yeah look
ha
look
but i think it's good that the people wins because most of the time people loose money there most be ones that win
um
yes i'm inscribed there
yeah i still get some calls but not as much as before it does take some time before it really starts working it takes about a couple of months
pilar and from where where are you from
and then you start realizing that they say they say we are putting you up in the list the list will begin in about three months
but then you realize that you are getting fewer calls
you still get some calls but i don't know
um
um
um
sure
yes yes i think that sure i think that no not all companies are like the
they don't pay attention to the list or maybe i don't know maybe they don't have the list i don't know who gets to that list
eh it's like that i don't i don't know if you put your name on in it your number in it
ah look eh and where are you now
so they call anyway
um
ah that's good
um
um
um hu
sure sure
sure
sure
un sure
hello
yes um
oh in what part of madrid ehm oh in manhattan
but well we have to talk we are getting sidetracked and they are not going to pay us the topic for today is the telesale no
and what do you think
when they call you on the phone to try and sell you something
no nothing of course
i don't know nobody that that that likes that in fact i don't knw anyone that has ever bought never nothing by by telephone
but let's see i think that so somebody must buy them because if not
yes of course but they can make too little because i
i have never heard of anyone who that doesn't bother i even think that it hurts them more
hello what is your name
because it is like negative advertising for them
because they are calling people to their homes and bothering them
well people is basically not giving a good opinion right
yeah well yeah
they can be convinced to sell them something
unfortunately yes
right right and spam also
right
and you it's less annoying then right
and no you never check it for
what is your name
i i do check i check every time i enter i see the spam email because once it had happened to me that some email was not spam
it has gone to the spam folder but the majority of the people do not check it and it has happened to me that i write someone
and they don't answer me and they dont answer me
and it was because it had gone to their spam folder and they did not even looked before they earase do you understand
i see it that way but rare time almost always in the is good almost always they send spam to the spam folder
and i do not receive anything from spam to the inbox
how
have various have from yahoo and from hotmail have various and it is good because because the spam is well protected a virus can not go in
no but yes even sometimes you can get email from people you know but they are virus
and that also does not let you open is fine is fine
ni ni
the what
yes
not if you you have to download the whole file but that is what hotmail doesn't let you it doesn't let you download the file
because really it has many tricks those emails with viruses and many times it looks like yes it is a person you know who is sending something that interests you
and it is it is a virus i mean that you have to be very careful and and the those who send ads through the internet i mean they send spam really they are selling stuff
i i don't understand that who buys from them
yes it is almost always
yes all that is illegal they sell through in that way
eh pills that are not approved that they promise miracles and people believe it i don't understand
who believes that
nico nico i don't understand but it is not a spanish name no
of course
wowthat's crazy
it's really dangerous many people has spent a lot of money in those kind of things
yesthere is some people a little bit crazy
that is lack of intelligence lack of a real thinking process let's see how is going to be true why did i received that email from all the email accounts in the world
yes
of course
yes because practically the casino wouldn't exist
yeah
it's good that they go to have fun for a day those that go because they don't have an addiction and they need to play and those that do it professionally because they have certain games i think that if you hear of a game it's black jack
i am pilar
where you have the probability that if you play well you'll win money
that i don't know
i think you fail but i guess that
right in the poker i know i saw a documentary with people from mit who had their tricks for counting their cards which is illegal of course the casino is really prepared anything that you can do to beat the casino they prohibit
and it isn't really cheating cheating would be well to mark the cards you have
cards up your sleeve but if you have the ability to count cards why is that going to be cheating so they went casino to casino so they don't get caught
winning a little bit in each not winning too much in each casino so as not to call attention to themselves but they catch them and they bar them from entering the casinos
and they had to go to europe to win in the casinos in europe
that's funny
but what if no one
pil pilar
sure it's just that nobody gives away money people want to believe that
it's really weird that for anyone to give away something so rare they are always looking for something in return the thing with the lists you've included your telephone number
does it work
good
however this list is not mandatory i mean it should be mandatory that if you place your number in the list they can't call you
but it's not it's just a list for the companies so that they don't bother in calling people that
that have previously expressed a desire for not being called it's a waste of their time and money
yes many companies don't care they try anyway
they don't look at the lists they call you and make you loose your time
and they loose the money
from spain
hu
i know yes
i never get them i'm lucky my phone number is new
i added it to the list in january and the calls that i got are from services companies that i've hired some service from them
they want to sell me more services
that's annoying too
but next time they call me from the same bank
they have called me several times for the same thing and i will tell them to please add me to their bank list
do not call
i say they should have a list because hundreds of them or yes
in new york
if one of their customers tells them not to call they are dumb to keep calling because the client can get mad and leave
so i will try it to see if they can stop calling me the annoying bank employee because they always want to sell me the same thing and i always say no you are trying to sell me the same
is they think that one day i will say yes because they insist i do not understand
hello
yes
well i still think the same i like some of them other's not so every now and then i get mail here today i got three
again about refinancing my home i say no those people don't leave you alone
yeah
yeah that's that's true that's really true
um i always check them out
yeah because well like i say there are some where you can find something good if you look at it but i don't like that on the phone
yeah
and sometimes they call me very early and supposedly they can't call you until after eight they call me before eight but i don't answer
if i see
is tammy
yeah i check the caller id and if if i don't know who it is then i wait for the machine to take it if i know the voice then i pick it up
sometimes yes sometimes if i pick up the phone and say uh i already know who it is and i say no thanks no thanks or sometimes i act like i don't speak english
so that they will leave me alone i don't speak english there
in english
no they haven't talked to me in spanish only in english
yeah over here they don't it hasn't started yet over here well that's what i have to say
no over here there are a lot
there must be because yes there are plenty around here there are a lot of mexicans around here
there aren't many there are people from panama but i don't know many and
no no they ha no one has called me i don't know about other people but they haven't called me
alex again how are you
oh yes
i entered my email inbox today and i had ninetyseven
aha
yes it's true
too much it's too much stuff that you don't even ask for my husband was laughing yesterday because he got one marketing mail that was about nudist beches and i was laughing too
better said where did they know that i am and i yes i was laughing
i had a real laugh because i was holding the letters but the one they sent him if you look at it on the outside don't know doesn't say nothing on that
he had it in his jacket so that no one saw it i said they will who will start looking into you stuff and yes i was laughing
you why do they always send that i say don't know no clue
aha
i do not think there are too many people that do this survey
ah
that's good aha
but you have to be careful when you get in
mhm
aha
ouch mhm
i remember i also when i went to see my lawyer the girl that works at the office the secretary was crying an i tell her why are you crying she says no it's that
a this telemarketing have taken five hundred dollars from my account
first a hundred and fifty the other one and she was fighting so the lawyer that she works for was going to help her with that
no people don't think about that
because i have already spoken to you three or four times
i even when when i buy things on the internet my husband and i have a bank account that that we only put money into that we're going to use on the internet
that way if we're going to spend sixty dollars that's what i place there and use the card and that's it
what
exactly me too
i heard about that in the news that they had caught a few people in the government of a of an african city
they were mm
aha
yes to me i
there are yes i with those people i don't with those of my bank account no no no no they have even called me from canada for me to buy
lottery tickets
and another person two or three no i think that after we speak of what is said i thinks so
in canada i say for what i say if i don't buy lottery tickets here once in a while i do it i say so why would i get involved with the canada lottery
no what not what yes that you are going to become rich no no thanks
well yes a a card that they sent my husb my son's girlfriend who said that if she that she had won some earrings of
of diamond and a watch and some money and had to send them like twohundred fifty dollars to send them his prize
and she says to me because she only is eighteen years old i say don't send anything without think like a crazy
mhm
yes
mhm
right yes
yes
oh no no it is our fault that we do not have too many people that go in the survey
yes because any person there are persons that are is that way that it is easy for them to be in things like that when they listen that something is free i say when is free
mhm my husband always says me that when is something like that he reads everything the the minute letter down read it well well because they can get something with you that you have to pay something
because it is difficult after you signed get something from you that is
mhm so you should i always tell that to my sister and to my kids
read everything if i haven't got anything in spanish yet
people don't think i'm latin when they see me so i pretend also so now you have that
you can call to get your telephone number deleted t obe removed from the marketing that's cool
but i don't know i don't know i could ask my husband he knows about it because they say it's free you entre your phone number and your name and they remove you from
the list they have because there are others who keep calling even if you tell them
because
is funny
because they buy the names the names list
and sometimes as they once told me they go from number to number from one two three fou five they don't know my phone number but
they go exactly like this one two three four five the numbers like this they dial directly like this
so it's easy for them not to miss any because they follow an order
mhm
and today i do it early and i could not and so i said i will call later and i forgot and all of a sudden
hello
i always call at nine sharp and is nine sharp
well what do you think about the telemarketing
sometimes there are very good offers
i like marketing more over the mail because it's not so uh how can i tell you it's more private and you can see the offer without the pressure of the
of the call
and sometimes there's there are good offers i don't throw out everything i get
i i sometimes i look at things
well everything's a risk in life i don't i think there' aren't too many risky things everything's a risk sometimes you'll win and sometimes you'll loose right
the problem is when they bother you at improper hours or when they take advantage of someone
yeah i really don't care i usually don't answer calls
yes
i know that it's telemarketing
yes
and do do they speak to you in english or spanish
never in spanish
and ind and because here since there are a lot of hispanic people here on los angeles sometimes they call in spanish
well i think you're the only person that speaks spanish in seattle
according to the fisher poll
yes
but they don't do marketing in spanish
and the other thing that bothers me sometimes there's a lot of marketing spam on the computer
alex
there's a lot of that that should be controlled more by law
sometime a hace a special email option to filter
and sometimes i have a thousand emails pure marketing
and i get to trash them you spend 10 or 15 minutes to trash them all when i could do something more important
yes wow
that is incredible
but sometimes you get good stuff like a year now i got something to got at show around here
and i won some tickets to vegas and others to disneylandia
and i didn't spend nothing
you have sometimes when good things come out from the marketing
good
yes you have to be careful specially by computer and credit cards because many times it's a trap
i have a friend that was fooled with marketing of a credit card
and they took his money from the bank from his account because he didn't think and gave them the number of his account
and the charged him about two hundred dollars just to apply for the card
yes because
that happens very often that shouldn't happen never should you give out that information of ah financial to a to a telemarketing party
because they are going to steal from you it's a legal robbery
and you know something else that has been very
eh i have received letters from ah foreign entities that want to send money to the united states
and and they want their bank account to do the transaction and i believe that it is like a trick where they are not going to give you anything they are going to clean out all the money you have in the bank
i do not think there are too many people no
yes it comes out of africa
and from great britain too and one time i found out a company that was making me an offer because they were going to pay me a lot of money
and it happened that it was a fic company it was not real
they wanted to clean out the bank
mmh
yes
yes well they always say that
yes
and and also many times have happened to me that i have won things in the computer
but i have to do the survey and in acuesurvey i have to buy something
well will you be paying us
and i already know that it is a trick because you give your name your address and your phone number
and then they ask for more they want that you buy anything
then i never do it and never have received nothing to me i have never received something is like a marketing
it should to have laws against that cheater
free or or that you have won something
in spanish that is called a hooking
and there is a lot of this happening in spanish as well
you will get it one of these days
yes that's cool
i think they will keep on calling because they say that the calls are spontaneous but how come they know your name also if they are calling spontaneously
yes
how can they know your name
mhm
yes
thenm i think we agree the best marketing is the postal one
or newspapers
yes okay same
i am here at this time
good evening milred from connecticut
well so look i i vote for my party but sometimes when i like a candidate from another party i vote for him too
i don't know how do you say it doesn't me it doesn't me i am not a fan of of really of i don't know so what they say well just could it be just an idealist from that party but that
when i see that one candidate is going to do something good for my community or the estate then i do vote for him even if he is of other
and i vote for the other candidates that that my party has but i don't to say don´t don't try to how is it said
aham aham
yes i believe that they are a little more more conservative in certain aspects but in some other things well sometimes they go too far
yeah because of that i believe that it is not no they do not stay much in the government because they leave like like like they get afraid after they go into things it's like
they get afraid and roll back or they stay
but the fact that they are conservative tells you that you know they stay out of things that they do not want to pass by because they comply to much to
ethical matters and of of politics you know they follow too much i believe that the concepts the democrats well what they see it is going for
how are you
even even if the people leaps on them so they at once are going to you know they do it even when everybody leaps on them to tell no that they do not want what they are
putting in but in truth well i don't know in my country at least the democrats em they have they have the control like for about twenty eight years
and after those twenty eight years that the leader died who was the strong leader of the party well already then it has been you know some years they vote democrats
others the other next four years they vote republicans and then they go back to the democrats and they put the republicans again it depends it is like they depend on on on how they see the country situation if they see that the country in all that four years nothing was made then they make the person leave
aha aha
yes i think but if a candidate this if a if a party has a good candidate and and like because look this man who governed puerto rico who was luis muñoz marín
he governed for twentyeight years he did many good thing you know brought much progress to the country brought things to the country that well that really the country when it was behind well he pushed it ahead
so well he he kept control then of all the people and after that that he died many they generations stayed i mean they still continued
even though he was dead what they followed was his idealism they didn't really this they didn't see that that that was what they were doing but that it was because like they were
popular party which is democrat well that was the one who went it was his his how do you say it to his leader but it was not true for because they saw that there was nothing being done well
aha
that i don't find that it should be like that do you understand i fid that if a candidate well well you see that it can be better well give him an opportunity
fanaticized you think
aha aha
yes because of a face because of a face and because a
for some gestures but
well but as always all the politicians promise i do this i do i do i do and when they get there they forget what they had to do
or maybe not that they forget maybe they found much much opposition because especially when they win a game that is the democrat's and
and most of the camera are won by the republicans then it makes it much harder to have the parcel well not all of them are going to approve all the laws they want nor will they approve all that he decided to understand
and they are the majority and those who go to to to vote and stand against the decision well many times i find that it is difficult to do so
a leader who is good but does not win the rest of his party then it becomes very difficult you know eh erm erm erm
and why can't you vote because you have not registered or because you don't want to
better put everything he wants in the favor for community
because then the others will not give them the opportunity
i think is depending on on you know if if we assume the democrats win and almost all are democrats
but when a democrat wins and everyone else are republicans they make their life difi
but there some also working to their own benefit not for the community profit actually
yes i see it's a bureaucracy
with is placed then fights and problems stats
yeah that´s why i tell you that whenever whenever they are not the same party it always brings a lot of problems then some people want one thing and some people want another
so no you never know what they are going to the truth to me me in politics well i´m telling you with m i got involved as
after i arrived here like like four years ago that i began to participate to take more action in the because i saw that they did not want to approve many things for hispanics and
oh okay
that they were not not treating very well so i got involve in in politics to help but it is also a lot of ins and outs and they take you they even look up the flakes you have to take them all you know
everything they can look to find you if you run for for any position forget it they investigate your family and they take you out that if you sell this if you sell that if your son did this if your aunt is it was that
so i dont´like that well i said no i can´t be on this issue
so i keep working and i help you but no i did not get into you know to run for nothing that i don´t have anything to struggle but i don´t like the the
and specially i find
specially in the republican party the democrat is a little more he has a little bit more of
of of this for the hispanics but the republicans are kind of racists they are more for for them
so the residents don't vote i thought that y
yes i always vote
there was a time were i would think like that i said ah i am not going to vote what for but uhm later i i got involved working with with one of the parties then i realized that yes that we need to vote especially the hispanics
so they can hear our voice and our vote there that it counts
oh good evening this is mercedes from philadelphia
only with the polit line of the party
ah sure sure sure ah and about the to say about what people sa good what people the eh the conception of eh the democrats being more liberal and the republicans being a little more
conservative what do you think conservative what do you think about that
yes
yes i think too is that eh perhaps like eh ah ah they are not much of being in the middle right but instead
they are to a side as they are like very ex no very extremist but they have the extremes i believe that perhaps
mhm
so it is here so it is eh and it is so here too but at times that eh is so in my country i also say but sometimes is not so eh eh a i would like that they realized that perhaps is a matter of the person not so much about the party
really or or another thing i don't know because also eh it is the other side of
mmh
pleasure to meet you well let's see we have to talk about politics
mmh
but some times eh em what i wanted to say too is that people who are like too much with what is the party true
eh and that it doesn't
yes i mean that don't maybe the candidate does not have the charity right but like they vote for their party they eh that is what i some times mm it doesn't seem but also at the same time
eh there are people that go too only maybe not with the qualifications eh intelectual or the capacity of the candidate but with their charisma as a person
that happens a lot in my country it is like that eh people complain they fall in love as they say
en en and because of what eh yes for life i don't know for the impression that has been given and no maybe not for eh
your resume or curriculum is it it's what can do or can not do
yea
mhm
what do we think about it that for me is a rather difficult topic because i have not been here much well i have yes like six years living here but never since i can n ot vote i have never been interested much in what is the politics of
mhm
yes
and that is something that to me seems counterproductive right because one would think that when already is everything one would like perhaps an ideal world that once in power all the work for the wellness of of all
exactly exactly and that's why let's say for example here how they are divided let's say when when passing laws right that first is the congress after it the senate and then president right
but usually a lot of laws are initiated by the president right but you have to spend the challenge of the senate and if the senate belongs to
the party with the majority is from a opposite party there's a big problem in other words it seems to me that's good because ah erm
because there is some control right in equity between the two parties but at the same time it slows the the things and that is is the bureaucracy is left to decide
yes
and another thing i have read that many of the things made in the united states i mean laws and bills are president initiative right
but usually they are done as a group right of uh of initiatives in only one document for example right because as they they are presented once
because i am not a citizen yet
to to to the senate for example one day and they put as addendum or added right to the law that this other law this other law maybe people don´t support those other but do support the main
but like those other were not attached to this one they are not passed then they say no no we don´t pass them because of because of that right and maybe the main idea was that one that everybody agreed but now
they have to start again
mhm
mhm mhm
mhm mhm
mhm
yes
yes yes that is uh me that i agree with that yes that maybe for the same thing that they are i don´t know
i am only oh resident so i can not vote yet and for e
don't don't don't vote we don't vote one has to be uhm citizen to vote do you vote have you ever voted
oh
yes and what do you think of the democrats or the republicans or the differences between them
hmm
hello
yes yes yes yes very well
yes some times you stay with the more superficial and by a little you start to have something good
uhm uhm
uhm uhm uhm
yes yes yes
now it had an air like pretentious no sometimes to know too much
and maybe this i saw it few times it came to philadelphia to make a pair of meetings
and uhm to me his message i believe that he said intelligent things but that isnt finished to reach to the people that did not finish of
of that to have sufficient charisma
uhm uhm now now
now now now
um i here the well it surprises me o the fact that there are only two big parties that people there are have only two options because well in spain it is really
uhn uhm also on the contrary no is like or pretend to be like one more an uncle good im like us yes
yes yes yes yes that is the paper that he plays that in the fact is not because to see his family is a well that has a lot of money and is a to start and i mean that
that no is not another of us we can say but is the
n
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
um um um um
but is all the opposite yes yes yes
um um um um
um um um um um um
sure sure
even a bit chaotic no because there are
um and hilary clinton that looks like candidate
yes
there are many more options then
um you have from more conservative parties center ecologists more to the left then
i for example i am from barcelona then think there are more procatalonia parties unless i don't know what then
of options more or less i mean more or less bigger you have even six just about and then if you start counting the little parties you can have up to twenty
but that they have then representation in parliament normally there are um six parties then
but here it is it is one it surprises me no that it is like that white or black
and and
i'm laia from philadelphia
yes that is the problem in addition that is the problem because well if there were
right right yeah yeah yeah yeah sometimes they're not so different and you can feel you can feel a bit without representation no almost
erm erm erm erm
sure
erm erm erm erm
erm erm erm erm
erm erm erm erm erm erm erm erm sure
erm erm
what what's his name
oh right yes yes yes that was a man erm
good and you
yes erm
um um um umum
yes no he was a multi millionaire yes
yes yes well and even there were at the end there were such
nader or naser or or something like that ralralphum
but sure running him out is also little throw your vote in the trash can no because you know that that really no it will not paint anything
um yes yes yes
yes um um umum
uh uh
sure sure
very good
sure the the thing in spain is that ah yes vote don't know well votes for a very small party
but that after the in any case it is important because you know with the alliances that are made if no party has absolute majority well really a small party can be very decisive and very important to say who who is the boss this well has happened many times
and history then i mean that it is not a matter of saying ah how is small party well i don't vote because it is not going to help at all because it is
yes that can really help because of course in this system here really it is a
one or the other no
yes yes yes yes
um
um um um um
of course
of course and it is a lot to break this dynamic and also
well we have to talk about about politics right
well with all the money that is needed no to present and campaigns and
ah yes yes well i i remember the the first ones that bush won really people were very much surprised no of first this very complicated voting systems no with the little holes and i don't know and that
that really there was so much so much confusion no in the
it would be well the biggest most stable democracy and mor than i know
but
exactly exactly exactly
yes yes yes
in two thousand
yes
yes it was it was very strange the truth the truth
what
um um
yes yes
yeah i was very surprised that that al gore didn't insist more eh no that he didn't protest a bit more no because it was all so so strange so obscure that
that i don't know i was surprised that he withdrew so quickly that i don't know well no but if i don't know i don't know i don't understand that
uh uh well
hm yes and i suppose that things would have gone very eh differently no yes
but well eh yes
yes yes yes
um um
and nothing the and the lat and the latest ones too it a bit tri well i don't know i was very sad because i thought that there would really be a change no and that people
yes
there would be
um um um um
um um um um um um um um yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes i mean the second time is indisputable i mean um
um
uh uh yes yes
because you can vote here
you you vote i mean you are an american citizen i mean
of course um um um um ok ok ok
um um um
yes yes have we talked ah very well uh uh uh
um
um um um
clearly
clearly yes yes yes
clearly clearly yes yes at least a good thing that you have is that there are only two terms of office per president so at least the next time good equal is worse than bush but good i doubt it no
yes there this is good because in spain there is no limit
and i don't know if it perpetuates itself in the power for years and years
and well also it's good that there is relief of
clearly no even though eight yes already they have been able to to enough yes yes
yes is it already known who will be the democratic candidate
i'm studying at a university in pennsylvania here in philadelphia
yes yes yes
in two thousand year in the eight
mmm
but i don't believe that kerry is going back to subnmit no
i mean
oh
oh
oh
sure now
oh
hello
now now i remember good let's talk about politics
so you'll have to have a message like that simple
that clear and the people thinks the things they listen but they believe only the things that are simple and clear
like the people do not want to hear a lot with lots explanation much complicated thing as one will lose them
as there is to say the things in very direct form and in a form that it can be understood like without doubt
and i believe that kerry was too smart maybe
uhm uhm
uhm
uhm
yes yes and gore was worst yet that gore was so intellectual
that the people were not able to hear
what do you think like like like a a student from another country what do you think about about politics here
did not understand it felt like distant wierd cold
sure sure sure a neighbor the men that lives in in the same clock from us like
a sure
sure i think that he is also very intelligent
i think that he appears to be stupid
as to convince to the people that he is not dangerous
like that that is like that
i think that is intelligent or if he isn't intelligent at least the people in his government is smart
because they do a lot of stuff not like no for coincidence i mean
is not past all the things without a plan
um
so
ah i like her ah eh i like her but it's going to be tough
um
ok
um um
ok
um look
look look
of course
hello em so nicole speaking from new york
of course of course and sometimes they are not so different
gray and gray bad and worse
yes erm yes yes there are small parties which have a very different point of view to others but they don't have
they don't have enough support
and they don't have enough money
erm so really there are two parties
so when you i mean always during the elections erm when you vote here erm they specify all parties even the small ones erm uh when you vote but the others it's such a small percentage
just once during the during the presidential elections there was a a a man who stood stood as an independent party
he's uh ross perot uh
perot perot
hello how are you
that was a few years ago and yet he i mean he won many many votes but
not enough to win but
i do not know he was a very very rich man
and sure is eh he could be an ideal person with another prespective typically it can not
i couldn't
um ah yes nader nader yes also is
sure sure it is one or is is to say something simbolic
but not to really vote for him because no he will not win one knows that same as he
eh he has many ideas very very good ideas in my opinion but
i would not vote for him simply because it matters to me who
good
who will really be president
um
of course um
of course
no it is always republicans and democrats always
i mean
and since history has been like this i mean many years ago there were other parties but
at least the last hundred years
it has been like that
um
em
um yes and what do people think in in spain or what do you think you about about about things that have happened here with the elections
so close and and counting the the the votes and all that mess
um um yes
um
of course of course it is like the only
because in this country we send people to other countries to watch elections to see that they are legal
and at at the same time our same election it is it is such a complex thing and it is difficult to understand
and really in the end no i know that election in the year
i mean that was in the year two thousand
that election it was a thing like like in the end it was like almost a paid thing or a thing by
about politics we spoke earlier or no
through connections because bush bush's brother he was the
the governor of of florida like like it all was a matter of as as if it was
as if it was happening in another place
um yes yes
um
yes yes me too i also saw it that way like how could how could he say ouch that's it
eh um um
yes yes there was another another history now i mean
imagine five years later
all that things that have happened
i think we spoke earlier
um yes me too me too the last time really
the first time felt very very an very angry i like like people really
most voted for gore and they selected bush anyways and i felt angry and the second time felt sad
because people voted for bush
like how they were to vote again after all what had happened
i thought what country is this i mean who they were voting
i don't know i don't know
of course well i voted but
yes yes yes yes i am an american citizen i mean i was born here
so but i don't know the system needs to change i think
yes are you from spain
because well well the government must also change but the voting system is very
it's very unjust because they go by state
it shouldn't be this way shouldn't be that the majority wins
period
or to go by states this gives a lot of power to the smaller states
um
um
clearly
clearly yes yes yes i agree with that because every eight years they are eight years and well it's like enough time
we will see what happens next time i don't know
ah yes we talked earlier eh em eh it's ah a student in the university over there right
no not yet it's very early still because that
that is going to happen in the two thousand year
eight you mean the campaign will begin with two thousand seven you mean two years ago
but until now no i don't know
no
no kerry really no he wasn't a strong candidate
really the democrats need someone more charismatic with more personality
with more with a message very clear to the people
to watch this today in day i don't know how was before but today you need have message very clear to the people in the politics because the people
it confused very quickly and how they don't have very much attention like they dont have much interest
david hello wendy
oh a little not much it's that i haven't talked to many people that in itself
to help you you know to show you where to go in your life you know
and and they only want to help those that help them the ones who give them donations here want food and want time
ah you know it just takes a long time in one's life
you know too
um
all of us went
if
but that is why because they are fried of of time before it then that's how they that's how they were brought up the time before the it the old timers
ehm if the church was a lot every sunday we had to go to church you know and and what happens in in those years
no no the the
for for
when you're growing up you lose your interest in church
and the then on one is not passing that same rearing to your children
and hmm mm
the service
yeah um didn't talk to many people for for the survey
yeah
oh yes
oh
oh aha okay
oh so you are in arizona how's the weather down there
oh yes
oh are you on a cellular or are you in a house
oh how are you
oh in your car
oh oh
what happened
oh this is about religion yeah that's it eh i've been speaking about the same thing for three days now they haven't changed it
no they don't change the the subject
right
oh no these past days these no they have been keeping the same subject for four or five days now religion
yeah and
yeah but men oh the people they get really mad
it's a bad topic men
in arizona here in connecticut
yeah
no no the people i talked to comes one comes from la
right
right yea
yeah no
yeah is very controversial because the people put
let me tell you they get brave that the other that not what does
good good and that is no
yes because
right for for me the people i mean all the world believes in it's it's religion no but you have different individuals
yea i think i talked with you before
different persons um in distinct part of the world like the chinese and the the muslims buddhists and the catholics the
there are diferences you know because not everyone has the same nursing
then who who is one to say and decide which religion is better than the other
good but people are getting well armed you're attacking you're attacking their religion you know
it is
it's a topic to talk about let me tell you
because i am a catholic too but you know when i was little my mom always took me to the church but i already got married in a catholic church eighteen years ago
yes everything but for me it's like there are many problems that became harder
in the catholic church you know
with enough money one puts as much money as they can that's hard you know everyone works hard for their money
i think i i talked with you last week
for a donation for a donation to the church that can help other people the people that are poor
and they are helping each other from one to another they help themselves because all the money that the families are giving to shut
you know that money you know
and there are millions millions of dollars
no
yesh i mean up here where we are it arrived over there in like i see i am i live near massachusetts
and and all the problems that are in it in the massachusetts church the florida church the new york church there are many many cures
that that they involve with many youth
and and already for thirty years it rose its church and knew of the priests who had problems oh and if you had a problem
they paid the family to be quiet you know and
yes your voice sounds familiar
yeah and all that money came out from the collection fee all of the money came from the church and was millions and millions of dollars
two hundred thousand a hundred thousand
you know
it depends or is
um including the the the the people who go to church
no
i am sorry for your salary already but
yeah you tides you do your your tides but the the
yes and if you investigate like it is a wcw two let me see your your your your your your your paycheck
you know you make yea but you can't go to church
yes yes i am from from texas right
yeah yes
but it's the same thing i know at church that it is here but l the the church where i was and it is big and the people who go there
m have cures and know that or is because the whole world has your name on the envelope and that is not you only gave twenty dollars this week
you have to give thirtytwo dollars no you make six hundred and fifty dollars minus tax
you have to give the chur the church thirty and this so you know and they they wait expect it
yes
hm
hmmm
yes what you put um um yeah
aha
you live in texas
aha lutheran
okay hm
oh yes

yes but
yes
how are you
ah yes but i was going to ask what's your age aproximately
twentysix okay then you are still young we have i have forty years
and when we were going to school before it was a lot different it a lot more was more but not asking for much it was more you know
um more
this is not in spanish
then one prayed more it was more by the person than by the church
these days it's more for the church than for the person
you know this is key you want to go to church so that you can help the church
you know instead of the business being left behind this and the other to help you and everybody is just going backwards you know but honestly
the church is for here for the youth you know for the people
hello my name is wendy
