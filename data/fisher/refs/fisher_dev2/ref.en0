they nunc never married again she is an old fashion mother no what did she say i will became a ci already put up with one will not put up with another one
oh from puerto rico oh ok
yeah
yes yeah
yes that is what happens well each one has a destiny
their karma like we call it in the vedica philosophy
yeah you know about karma
ah so good
mhm
mhm
yes that is true no each one does one has one each action has a reaction and if one acts positively one also has positive reactions
otherwise with negative actions this is another way to understand to doesn't
so
i mean they are suffering right because of their karmic relations
mhm
oh ok
mhm
mhm
yes yes that's true
yes and talk about which and stuff but we have to use the word marriage i guess
hi good af good evening
oh ok
ah well m it's great
no no
no i was married but not anymore yes
well have you been in atlanta for a long time
a me too i've been here eleven years i came here in ninety four to go to college
ah okay
well you can say that you can say that you're from atlanta then
pretty much but do you go back to to to peru every now and then
ah okay
oh well would you look at that i'm from
it's hard right
it gets hard sometimes one gets enveloped with his own life and it gets hard to come back from his visited land
well exactly yes i know that to come back ah a a a a flight to puerto rico if on sale is not that expensive one can get it
at least two hundred twoway
but if it's not on sale you're paying 500 to 600 per passenger
yes it's like three hours from here flying
yes well i guess that at all it's then a lot more expensive
do you have family around here
oh
well they said we could talk about anything but you know
yes we're pretty close is this the first call you took
if you want to talk about marriage well we can talk about any marriage
i don't know mine lasted three years and honestly it was because i married too you know too young
and we hadn't well you know we had the wrong idea
compared to one another and then when we started a real life that
let's say well no we couldn't sustain the relationship
no
no
no and we couldn't you know we got divorced but we remained friends even though it's been years since i heard from him but you know we left you know
it wasn't ugly we didn't break up like in hate or anything like that
and i always wish the best for him but we just know we made a mistake about our age and our maturity when
oh and i am on my cellphone they called me three times but i was at the store so i couldn't you know take ten minutes to talk
we did that
yeah thank god
so that means that you met your husband here right
in atlanta
am but is he also from peru
ah okay and do you have children
that is nice
ah gd bless them
i hope that one day yesbut if not you know i am happy with my life
yes let's see because i said after this i said that i didn't want to marry again until i don't know what
but where are you from
and it is not in my heart that it is going to be forever
it doesn't matter what is coming i can stand and i can endure it
so we will see
yes this is the most important
want it and have faith
i don't know perhaps your parents are they still in peru
ah okay
ah well mommy and daddy moved from there to here after i moved
and then my brother also followed me here and all of them now i have all my family here
yes mommy lives by the airport and mommy and daddy are coming up i believe 35 years this year in december
puerto rico
being married yes
yes
yes they met when mom is two years older than dad but they met when dad was eight fou no sorry fourteen years and mom had sixteen
and they went steady pretty soon afterwards and since that time until now they have been together
so that is a positive marriage which we can talk about
yes
yes what happened with well you know of course that my mom loves my dad very much and that has a lot to do with it but also what happened with my mom it was that she
came from a poor family a single mom
and she never had anything that she h could call like it was you know her own
and then when she found my dad and he was the lo love of her life and got married well she then had something her family it was
yes yes
you know he belongings
and she it a lot that's why
yes exactly exactly
ah
no porbut they also say and maybe right for for one there is only another another soul
you know that you get another person
and after when you have that person in your life yes i know if anything happens and that person leaves well you know you have a need to look for anyone because you were satisfied with that
yes
exexactly their karma
oh yes
well yeah uh they said that we could talk about marriage or talk about anything
oh yes is very important to know of that because many people do not want responsibility for their actions and they beleieve not
they are not going to pay what they are doing
and that's not that way
exactly
exactly
and i have i think my own karma
mmm how do you say because of my own spiritual ideas
but if you believe in karma cientificaly as an energy energy doesn't create nor destroy
then if you create negative energy that energy must go somewhere
and it is to come back to you because you created it
oh ok well we used it right are you married
and my spiritual point of view is that god created us to have a better life but you are responsible of your own acts
hello
ah yes he is already independent
oh you have recently moved
ah now and already they uh everyone already you are missing each other right
hmm
yes yes i am married
eight
oh but you see my children are still young the one is seven and the other just turned three years old two days ago
yes time passes very quickly and you don't even count the years and the children grow
oh really
aha
good night
yes
ah and yes now yes
yes the couples now it is very rare that they actually last
no now for every little thing and problem and then all of a sudden they're separated
a lot of times they don't
they don't intend to don't int to attempt to improve things in their marriage
no he's american/
ah yes mine is brown skinned american
mine is brown skinned american
ah here i have lighter skin
ah my name is norma from here in atlanta georgia
no my husband's black no but he's very nice
american women are now very independent they want to do no
ah
yeah
ah sure maybe no they don't
they don't value things like they used to no now it's different the mindset has changed for for marriage
ah
yeah
yeah
ah yes very cheap right
ah ok how are you
really the husband is being managed by the wife
really
in the latin society we are used to a have a patriarchal
you every now and then one could be have more of an open mind
ok
lol
divorces
marriage doesn't last
the two factors
uh huh
ah here yes well so so with the children
it's that if one as a good latin woman one a lot of times eh must they're used to it no to raise her voice
ah
ah yes societies are different one even though it doesn't seem like it no even though it doesn't seem like it at the beginning but there are a lot of differences really culture differences no
uh huh
ah you
uh huh
sure yes i also had one or have a friend who married an american and he says like how different latin women are
yes really he a he apreciates a lot say
no because he the latin women are very different no no they don't they don't create many problems
ah that yes on is more loyal i suppose
ah ok
very visible no that one is more loyal really
more more a lot more loyalty
mhm
aha
yes it is very sad no that married couples don't last very long and really if they have kids the kids suffer a lot
yes
aha
oh really
ah poor children
hmm sure
yes yes i have two children
yes the children suffer ehm a lot they get traumatized when they are very little and have all of those problems no in the home
they get traumatized a lot
hmm
of course
oh yes it is really a pity no that is why there are so many
many times the government removes the children from people like that when they don't handle things well when
no they abuse them psychologically or
or physical or physically
hmm
oh yes well
ah yes and two also
oh yes do they fight hard
aha
ah they are already grown they are already teenagers
hello
yes he moved about ten minutes from my house
so then aja down from the hill was already below so then
yes i miss him but every once in a while he calls me or comes over here on the weekend to eat or something like that
yes and are you married
for how many years
oh i've got 18 years in november
ah yet still i once in a while look at pictures of my little boy and say my god where did the time go
yes yes the other day he was angry with me because i hadn't come out yet and a man thought he was my husband
because people don't believe how old i am
so then he bravely says i'm not his wife he's not my husband this is my mama i look at you and your small children should be happy that i think your mama looks so young
good night yes my no my name is tami
but good for aya because lately what i've realized also is that people
here it's very quick to to get divorced
nobody wants to work on their marriage
mhm
mhm
there's no patience
your ma is your husband latino
mine too
yes you told me what
mine is white i'm the brown one
oh i am from here in washington washington state
ah
ah yes yes my husband always tells me he says thank god because i'm from panama and he says thank god they sent me to panama and i met you
because american women he says
i don't like them he says not so much about independence but that they don't respect marriage
that's what he says no he doesn't say no because i'm i'm very independent but
i always take care of him
you know i don't give him
no hmm yes it's so different because my husband works with some young men
and they my husband's coworkers are american no
and the women give them like twenty dollars every too weeks for lunches the rest they keep that's american women then it's power it's funny my husband has an xbox so they come to my house to play
eh very well and you
and i laugh because my husband calls them it sounds like they're teenagers can you play today and he says no my wife won't let me and i laugh i tell him
and you your wife lets you do whatever you want the others have to have to ay i laugh a lot i tell him
working all day at least an hour to relax no
when my husband goes to luch or something like that i let him go i tell him go and enjoy it
he tells me we couldn´t go because his wife didn´t let him go
ok totally
i say no way
mhm
i think that men like that when women are a little more flexible the point is to be happy
that's why i tell those women that men might leave them
i was here painting my house
they have him too tied that the man might look for other place
mhm but no
they don´t understand
mhm i say no my husb no my children always laugh because barely it's that if we my husband and i we don't don't yell at home and even that if anything that i'm calling to and uh
i have a high voice because i'm on the second floor of the house
my son says don't fight i tell him i'm not fighting i'm yelling
uh huh exactly and my son i always tell him and they tell me stop yelling friend do you want me to tell you when i'm yelling i'll show you my pa
aw so
it's it's that a lot of differences
yes it's it's it's it's so funny because my husband knows co since i met him uhm like he didn't know how to dress so well
and they called me i say ok oh my god then are you married
so then i always i always put the clothes outside for him
in the morning i say eh i don't mind i put it outside for him and how they cause him trouble at work and i say well
if he's the only one who looks good at work why do they cause him trouble
i say from all those who go that pants with holes and the women who don't you see and to nowhere and i say my husband i don't cause him trouble and he dresses well what do you have with problem with him
and he starts to laugh i don't care that that he says i'm calm with my woman he tells me i tell him well well ow no eh
mhm
and yes it is that
no and when we love we love hard
aha that is true
yes but here
me too i
mhm
here not here does not matter the i have a a friend of my husband's best friend got married and in five years they were divorced and was that a prostitue and that
other women and i don't know and i say ay my god and we in the middle because i was friend of the wife and of him and my husband his best friend
ay god i said i don put me in the middle of this ay i that i ay i say dahts is really bad don't ask me what she said because i am going to tell you
but like that fast
yes yes i have one here my neighbor next to me
oh she got married with this man and he had a child of about eight yeirs old oh eight years
and they had two and this women him she was him on to the child on the face
don't touch my children you are not my son and i don't know what and and i here i say ah i would like to grab that kid and bring him here to my house
because i would say she was i sometimes i tell her the other day i told her you know what i am in my house i don't want to hear your conversation about what that you are calling your exhusband sirty and i don't know what because you are talking to loud
yes i have two children well one is nineteen and the other one is fifteen
and your kids i say poor of your kids that are listening to all of that those bad things you say about their dad
and she says ah don't me
hmm
and kicked out the husband from the house and put another boyfriend there
i say oh my god you didn't even give him time to that the man had gotten out of there and he already had another one
and that one too like he yells to the children like he yells to the children
i say
mm yes that is woman
does not work
yes that is true this woman does not work the dad pa her bought the house and gives her money every month
aha yes and the oldest one has already left home
buy his i would think listen if they give you money every month listen do something help other persons or something not just inside the house and and i think that is why she is frustrated
because she does not anything and with those children that make an effort so badly i say oh god that i have to scold them because they are also on my on my side with that battle and i don't know what
oh oh and i with the husband i did not get along with him
i he came over to to yell here in my house and i send him to my husband would just look at me he tells me i have never seen you like that and i say good since latin women when you bother them and bother

to teach them to see if they have the ability to sing
then those we used many handkerchiefs many eh sticks to see if they know this a rhythm you know if they know you you you you you you you
you know if they can do that you know so
but they didn't take me because i couldn't sing one had to know how to sing and play an instrument
and i can't sing nor put up with the instrument
now i'm going to learn to take guitar
oh what a coincidence right
yes yes yes
um hu
um hu right right
um hu okay wait wait jeffi i'm talking this is business this is my baby he wants the games charger
yes the one that is fourteen yes
he believes he believe that is going to play now he's going to sleep now and you eh you uu do you have a lot of music in your house
oh okay
oh that's nice i would like to learn to play piano i would like it
okay okay
okay
it appears we are the only hispanics or what
right you are the one that is hare krishna right
yes yes yes i knew it i knew it okay
yeah
yeah
yes yes yes yeah
yeah yes
yes and music also use today they are making music for math
or is two plus two is four four plus four is eight and many many of math is
learn to write and spelling also there is a song that you can write this word it teaches you to sing it so you can remember the word
there are many things out there with music all is music because many children sometimes do not learn only talking my baby learned a lot with music
okay
he learned the the time tables with music i though him like that you know
yeah
right yes exactly
yes yes
do you know i recorded to my elder boy the songs i read in english
my brother records in spanish
so one day he listened in spanish the other day in english
he kept a diary and he also had a book we also bought the book in spanish so he followed the story in spanish it was good my brother thinks we should make him read spanish not only english
because i read him a lot of stories and sometimes i was tired son i played a tape and he payed with it listening to the story
so that way i didn't read the story 70000 times
perhaps perhaps what music i like i like merengue
because when they are young you must read a lot
exactly exactly
exactly
it's true anyway how minutes have we talk so far i'm tired i worked so hard oh my god
and at work i am always singing also let me tell you
i always do because it is like the day goes by faster when i sing and and i don't let people fight or have discussions to disturb me
i am always singing yes they they call me the singing office worker because i am even singing
i have to sing yes yes yes
o yes yes yes they talk very badly
awful they speak awful i don't know i don't know how mothers i went to a party
i like the charismatic music they are playing oh playing now in the catholic church
and the gir i think was three years old and she was playing with that music i took it and took it away
i said this is a children's party and i brought music and i always bring my music how am i going to do it the clown i am going to play this music and when i played my music children started this is old people's music i don't want that
they wanted the the the music yes yes and i told the mom how can you play that music that kid already saying fu and
and all the bad words he was saying i said how horrible
yes yes yes yes yes
yes
yeah
yes it is true their games their games
they are so violent my god
you know the mothers and the fathers they all buy those to get their children from their from their sight
we are playing a lot of charismatic music that one of those who sings it is young mm miguel aquino me fine is like merengue but with jesus christ in in the music
but they are very bad because some are in there all day i have a nephew who is in his room all day to listen to music and play those games he doesn't leave
he doesn't leave and he is fourteen years old
yes yes yes yes
aha aha
yes that it makes me sad for the children who are young now
yes yes yes yes and less sociable because
when you're with the computer or when you're listening to music
you're not sociable you don't start speaking to people or anything
you don't want to see people
aha yes yes yes mine is the same the same he doesn't like to talk with other people i tell him that he has to be sociable
how are you good evening
oh okay oh okay
yeah we had to talk about music um well i like salsa actually right
right its um hispanic right hispanic music then i like the music they put on my church as well we call it quirta
right is it in christian language that also very happy
and i also like romantic music right i like slow dance songs i think that's what they call them
yeah yeah that's it that king of music uhum
uhum
oh of course you are the one that acts like a clown
uhum of course you chose your profession
of course too make kids happy you have to move right
oh i'm norma from here atlanta georgia
ha
sure of course it is something it is an active episode no
you want them if you want for example to teach them something to give them a lesson like that with humor then it's very important that kids
like that that they that they are part of the that they are part of the program
aha
um hu
like that it's good everything that aha
um hu
sure yes i mean many times when you use music no
it's like that people remember more about the things that happen
oh sure oh i don't know
no i above all the children and they as they are educated no they have more memory they have more memory then
something like that remains more in their mind
uh huh
um hu
um hu
um hu
cl
of course music is part of the culture every culture has its own music
and it's identified with that mus those people identify themselves each culture not with with a certain music for example the hispanic culture the many the
they don't identify with salsa merengue not those busy dances that music that there is
aha
no and many people like that um hu
oh that one the one that is fourteen
oh he ah then i remember
well yes i have music my husband he has more he likes more the music than me
he really likes the music he plays a little bit the piano
yes and yes he he then eh we have a lot of devotional music like the one of our siquirta church
what he has learned to play harmonium and bridanga and cartal
all those we are teaching to my kids too
yes right
yes that is and the music is so important mostly in the churches
i don't know could be
no the music always gives a good message
for the persons not so persons can remember no i see like this including when i watch a televison program
no what goes christian people also have their music they dance and get very exited
and all with music the music really infuence a lot persons lifes
um hu
yes um hu
um hu
um sure yes because todayfor example children when here in the abc in the alphabet
what that famous song
my three year old is also there with his games with a train game we bought him for his birthday few days ago
could be the group is not too big
so he is with songs the alphabet he records it and so the song is being recorded
mmm
oh that's good
mmm
yes because kids are like an sponge they learn everything
everything is recorded in their minds it's the best moment to teach them
the best things good manners
what
of course um hu
yes it is good there to lift the spirit
aha
well it depends i say also that music because there is some music i don't like that they call it now rap that many young people use
i don't like that music it is terrible
yes to
um hu
oh my god they talk so much stupidity
of course they learn there children speak all those things there they speak of violence and all those things
an issue like that very heavy like that for children
just because now there are not as many as many children and they get into all of those problems children begin to use weapons and this is a consequence of all the influence they have
all of
all of that music from all of what they see on television and the question of violence
mm
um hu oh those games too those games
yes
um hu
oh my god of course and the kids above all because they have so many influences no lack of activity the children have a lot of childhood obesity
no they are inactive they are in front of the computer playing their games or with the television
that is why there are people that are there but the kids are away
yes kids these days are always more inactive
um hu
sure
um hu
oh what those are spiritual music with the merengue
of course they isolate themselves
hi hello
it's folk music it's not rock or something like this he just plays the guitar he is a songwriter

oh aha oh aha
well about what kind of music you like
and your family is here too
uh um right
oh
oh right
oh right
oh right oh
oh right
oh
i was born here
no yeah
hello good evening midre from connecticut speaking
from what country are you
like the music had a more value the music would send you a message
oh
dominican
aha
oh yes but you don't speak dominican you speak more
mhm
i well eh no i'm puerto rican and i like salsa music
i like to dance
and i encounter music from many countries at least in puerto rico there's many great eh composers writers and we have artists like
jennifer lopez marc anthony
oh yes we already talked
gilberto santa rosa is known in many countries
oh i think that the music i love it i put it when i'm at my house i dance i clean faster it cheers me up it takes depression of me
when i'm feeling sad
or when i'm nostalgic about my country
because i listen to the songs that my mom sang that she heard
and you do you like music
oh
uh um
right
so how old is your girl
how are you doing everything all right
oh ok it's that's a good time for music
it is said that kids who who one are raised with music from the womb they stay calm and learn and are more intelligent
i don't know if that's true but
right
yes right as long as the kids mie the girls best period
i think they grasp is from from the day they are born to
four or five years somewhere
well then they forget a lot of things
yes
ah
good thanks very good
oh yes right eh the mentally challenged kids also learn a lot with music
because my son had a partner that eh had a baby boy that with down's syndrome and
ya she played music for him and he used to learn all the dances and everything very quickly
the fastest he learned
and he learned the songs by heart
aha
aha
aha aha
yes she she exercises mhm
yes it helps her to learn to to know the body and at the same time it relaxes her too because music is good
i think that we discussed about matrimonials
aha aha
i like that i go to a lot of salsa concerts concerts of
meringue music no i don't go to many of them well i like i mostly like folk music music from the the
what's the name like from the country
the plena the bomb all that and then after the
they do shows in new york of bomba and plena and we go to those
and we go to olga tañon concerts
so they have lots of nice music this guy that plays salsa this oh my god what's his name victor manuel
i never miss one of their concerts we always go to those
they do a lot of concerts here and we always go to those
aha
aha
yes because yes if your family is
dominican i imagine that you like to dance dominican music
oh yes
aha
aha they left
oh and now they are here
it's like a kid from a kid from my girl's group he was asked which country are you from and he said i'm mixed they asked him why and he said that because his father was from
this country and my mom is from this other country so his is mixed race and he said he didn't know what he was
right right
aha aha aha
i have showed all the typical music from my country to my daughters
i have showed them the dances i have showed them the music and they they don't listen to so much but they can dance it
so i was a member here of the group of the puerto rican stop
and and we did presentations and dances i was in charge of teaching the girls to dance bomba to dance plena
to dance salsa
so the the my children know how to dance all that because the they all like music very much
they all love the music
yes the typical music is more beautiful much more beautiful
i i also like peruvians music which i find gorgeous
chinese and indian music well i like also the their music it is beautiful i don't understand what is says but
yea
yes but the sound it has you know like it relaxes you
and now when i went to puerto rico i bought a disc of those that bring the music of the water
of the of the trees of the
ah when you want to relax when you are very tense well you play this little music and you hear well very pretty
it sounds very pretty
aha
yes aha yes no message or anything
and that you get here and you have to put away and get the shopping out and come up with the shopping and
that is why i say that music is very important for well at least for me
because i was raised with my whole family always with music
today is the music
my children my daughter i is seventeen years old so she is with that reggaeton thing and the and the hip hop and all of that music
my kids are already big and listen to american music
and
and me for example i cant really stand the rock and roll the kids listen too i cant really tolerate it for a long time
they make me very nervous they make me hyper
i don't really like rock and roll i listen to it and i have a few friends that have a band
and they sometimes invite me to watch them play i go and stay for a little while but then i say oh no i got ta go cause my head starts to hurt
the um those sounds get in your ears
oh yeah like regueton
i think that the music we used to listen too before is different like the composers used to dedicate themselves to writing love songs and romantic songs
hello
yes
mhm
i don't really care about that kind off music what i hate is what they say
yeah that i like that kind of music just not what they say that's why
mhm
yeah
then good i was born in puerto rico but we moved to the united states when i was five or six years old but my parents are dominican
so do i i feel that i am
no no i feel dominican and i don't feel puerto rican because i spent all my summers in santo domingo with my family but my my eh ay i forgot my godmother
she took care of me she was puerto rican so you know i have both
no but you know it depends it depends on how i say it
and you
mhm
mhm
mhm
i think that i already spoke with you sir before this is annie from miami
yes
uh um
yes
uh um
i like it i always listen to christian music
uh but also you know since i have a little girl i'm trying to to teach her oh come on teach her different kinds of music so i always have her listening to
uh classic music or latin music for children
uh or or in english uh you know the music with teaching her the colors or the alphabet or stuff like that and right now at this point in my life i'm more
like you know with children's music
that let's say the music that i like the most
but
well she's she's twenty months old
yes and
i don't know this night we went shopping and she was in the car eh singing that song about the alphabet
you know and my husbands looks up to me and says but not her you know a little younger for that i said to him i don't know but she is singing it
you know
yes
yes
well me everything
i have always forgotten a lot of things too that is why you know the music to us is something very very very eh eh
you know important we don't watch tv that much
yes good and you sir
so everything she learns lets say the animals whatever is because of music and the books we read
yes
aha
mhm mhm
yes
yes tha that's the way with her eh many times she starts eh i don't remember who is the one that sings it but we have a record that she's call the song in called
my aunt or aunt monica or something like that
and she likes to dance and when people see her dance they say ulala ulala you know
whatever and today probably about two or three weeks ago that you can't hear that song and she was all day long ulala ulala and i was thinking ok she's now remembering that song
you know but i like it because you see she moves her feet her knees the he you know so
eh i don't remember what was the topic that was gave to us the last time
we also can make movements and she can learn the parts of aha
the parts of of the body so you know al everything even though
and the language too what we are doing is that you know when my husband is not home i speak to him only in spanish
so when he gets here well about a ninety percent of the time we speak in english and sometimes you know i keep on speaking in spanish cause i'm used to that but
that way she can pick up both languages that's why i do it and also i play music to her so that she listen to music in english and spanish
aha
the plena and stuff like that
mhm
mhm
mhm
this was this was that you sir had
mhm
well
mhm and us to me i like merengue music instead
instead of salsa music
but
eh well it's pretty much the same because my parents lived in puerto rico for about twenty years before moving to the united states so
you know it's not like we were a typical family
because they lived in santo doming and then because of the revolution they had to
they left for puerto rico and from puerto rico they moved to miami
so you know they spent a lot of time in puerto rico and that's why sometimes i i don't know which country i'm from because it's like i'm
five kids was it
a mix you know of the two of them
yes that's right that's how i feel because sometimes i don't feel i don't feel comfortable you know i don't feel puerto rican
and i don't feel dominican it depends on
so but you know i i enjoy both cultures and it's not so different but they have some uh
words that that
um
yeah
um
um that's good
um
yes
i
i also what i salsa you know it's alright or whatever but i think that of all music i like the typical the most
yeah you know and like no yeah no i don't know i like it more and i like to watch the dance more than when people dances salsa or whatever
mmh
yes
aha
mmh how great
mmh
yes that is good that also that no we do many things that when you know like right now it does before of before this call we had gotten back from from shopping
not even five minutes and normally what we do is that eh we turn on the radio and we place one you know like a song that the music is kind of
and is
nothing else just music it doesn't have any lyrics
and that aha and that also help at least it helps me to be able you know to relax or whatever
yes
hmm
hmm
aha
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
hi um what's your name
what do you think about cell phones do you have one
i don't have it right now what i was in europe i had a phone
but here i don't have one because it's really expensive
and i don't have i don't have much money because i'm a student
and i decided not to have a mobile phone but uh that's not the only reason i've also never really like mobile phones very much i'm not sure that they're healthy
because of the radiation they emit hasn't hasn't there been some study
showing that really they're not bad for your health
and i don't want to use a phone all my life and when twenty years have gone by they discover it's bad for your health
and we all get brain cancer or something like that
right and you don't know until later if it was good or not
pilar
yeah that's too bad but
yes and besides that's also more dangerous
that's really dangerous there are a lot of accidents but fewer now because people are using headphones or handsfree devices or whatever they're called
but a lot of people continue without using those devices and when you have only one hand i don't know how they can drive well
hmmm
yes because it's also true sometimes in the the
on a bus in a bus people talk on their cell phones really loudly
and that's bad manners right
because you don't have to talk that loudly you can talk more quietly right
yes yes okay with but i believe they used the satellite telephones the the mobiles did not work well because the but sometimes they did work and yes
nice to meet you where are you calling from
yes sometimes it works and sometimes does not
but well it is it is true that the advantages i see in it are that always it is reachable
if the battery did not die if for anything somebody need you or need to speak with you
always you are reachable and that it is very good
and and then so eh also in some emergency
you can call if you stayed on the road with the car stopped and o whatever anything happen to you you can call and ask
ask for help and that it is really good that's because when i have more money and can afford it i'll buy a cellphone but what i'll do is use it with the headphone
are those here in in the united states also
oh so i will know about it because eh
sure
and where do you say where do you say that you live
sure because also the other the agreement you have to pay every month
and most of the times the plans already include the calls so they are more expensive
in europe i used to have a plan where one would pay a basic service and then the calls you would have to pay them separately but if you didn't make so many calls
it was a lot cheaper
sure
hm
sure
hm i think that that happened in europe first
the cellphones there are countries i've lived in austria and there the around an eighty percent of people would have one
so just a few didn't own a cellphone and those were the little kids or the older people that are not into that things or don't want to use them
in oh i don't know that
everyone in the world has a cell and well i have been here in the united states for some time after i left and came back after three or four years
nobody used a cell no one even had a cell
and in europe not everybody had a cell now i have returned and here all the world has a cell or rather those that have come here i believe that now they are more or less the same
yes yes yes the people who talk loud in the subway and bus more than others this is bad manners but there are even people talking as they walk down the street with
with a handset instead of a telephone in their ears they carry a telephone in their pocket and a very small handset that can't be seen and they go on talking and then it looks like they are just talking to themselves
yes and you stand there thinking this is crazy what is happening
but now its here i've become accustomed to it now if i see someone talking to themselves on the street i think that he has a mobile phone well the other difference is that there in europe people use a lot of text messages and i don't think anyone here uses them
there are short text messages
you can write them with your cell and it comes out very cheaply only about 25 cents to send a message but its cheap in europe
here obviously the calls are cheaper but i don't know but over there a call would cost you uh around the same 25 cents per minute
ah huh
and the minimum is a minute but text messages cost 25 cents per message when you talk you are almost always talking for more than a minute
so
sure
that doesn't matter of course
but there well there it was popular especially among students overall
because those are the ones who write faster because with writing with a phone it's complicated because the only has nine buttons all the characters are there
but the the students turned it into some sort of of of game of skill and they even did tournaments of who could write something faster
and they saved a lot of money sending messages instead of instad of instead of calling they even had tactics some sort of language
and sure if you call and hang up without taking the call
whoever has called gets written
hm mm
then the the young people use that for calling for saying for giving signals say when they call you they call it a missed they call it doing a missed
when i do a missed they call the missed come down i'm waiting for you down there or sometimes just for show for that i remember you then
call and hang up and then i remember you instead of sending an email or simply that's a message of
i remember you so that means that the people from europe have a lot of imagination to save money if
a lot of cre a lot of creativity
yes but
of course yes
but that is very good
eh but if you use it more look at combinations for you to use with the auri with the earphone earplug whatever it's name
the earpiece but it goes far so that you don't get any radiation
i am from spain and i live i live in new york
just in case
that
sure sure
and have you heard about the phones of of the next generation that are that are already arriving
oh no i
yes i guess that too but i mean those you can even see the tv on them
you can you can look the internet you can look your email they have everything already it's like a mini computer with internet connection that's supposed to arrive eventually they've been working on it for a long time but it never comes
it is on europe already on some places it is in austria there was already it arrived last year
i didn't see it i never i never used it because it was it was more expensive of course but that that would be great
hm
no no it's for me for what i can see it's all euro from all the united states y have already spoken with people from well we should we should talk about cell phones no
oh of course and it communicated with with the with the machine
hello
ah yes yes yes yes yes
yea i've got a cell phone really it's like almost like i don't have it because n i hardly use it and i don't get many calls
yes if i use it it's uh pretty great but it's pretty rare that i use it and you
hm mm
yea
hm mm
yea ah for for why
hm mm
hm mm
hm yea
my name is mercedes and and you
like almost everything you start to use technology let's say now with the cell phone they're doing the same thing really that maybe yea yes
yes
yeah but let's say it's your turn to drive what would you think for example of the people who drive and use r cell phone at the same time
and that's just terrible i agree with you on that
uh huh hmmm
for some people i think that for me it doesn't bother me but it's the people who don't have respect for others in how they use their cell phones
right or maybe that they don't have the kind of manners when they're using their
their cell phone
uh huh
exactly
ah nice to meet you
and even more than that i think that for me more than anything else it's that people don't show respect for where they're calling the telephone people who drive but
well it's all about convenience so that's it phones cell phones are a technology that facilitates communication is so so
situations for example right now with the hurricane it was the only way for a lot of people to communciate with their families
yes that it is true because we have a friend that was in new orleans and we tried to call him to the cellphone and yes it was like it dropped
the network
and it did not work hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
hm mm hm mm
hm mm
mm i live in but i'm honduran of origin
that is and what but let' also say have the ones of cards really there are some of card that you only buy the card and use what you have in it
mm i can i know that they are selling by walmart
with yes yes yes because they say that they have not them because a problem is you have get a contract really and the contract never is less than one or two years
and i understand that with this you won't have to sign a contract and you have a card and you buy what you are going to use and
hm mm
yes
sure eh yes and let's say that's the problem i have we have now the plan that i have now as i say i have the phone but i rarely use it
and that's why at least we have one in which the minutes are summed up but if we sum many of them we are not going to be able to use them all
there's no way that that we are going to be able to use them
but oh well that's that and they are summing them up let's say in europe they use cellphones a lot it's pretty much the same as in the united states or
in
hm mm
hm mm
mmm hmmm
and those are the same problems that are here people don't know where to appropriately use a cell phone
that has happened to me i thought he was talking to me or or to who
mmm hmm
mmm hmmm
mmm hmm
i believe truly i believe that i don't think that is as common here
in my country yes let's say it is a little more common but i believe that it's the same economically for the people that's how we say it well i do
mm it's west of the city of philadelphia
ther's not as much money at my country as here is it here people here 25 cents what are them
exactly
hmm hmm
hmm hmm hmm hmm i couldn't do it
hmmm
hmm hmm
ok
aha
hmm
imagination a lot yes oh
past the next town is
a lot of creativity that's the word yes no me well as i say i would have to practice a lot to become a little but no and as i say since i rarely use it
and the truth the only and what the truth is that i have it but mainly just for emergencies and yes
someday the car's tire will deflate
mainly me the truth is uh huh
no
yes yes yes
yes yes
i'm going to have to let's see if buying one of those because it's dangerous right and say say ah the one the only one i talk of my fam family is my husband and every time
where he's driving if he's driving he hangs up i don't want you to talk with the phone and drive
i mean it's like never the truth few ve very few times
and you
it's are those the ones who have um the your credit card and all that inside them your data
no
oh
aham aham
ah
i was told by someone who had been to nor to norway he told me that what they had is that bu ba basically with the cell phone they could do anything buying huh food from a vending machine
paying huh the parking meter like that because it had the information of his credit card
ah no i thought that they were speaking to um it was only people in the philadelphia area
hello hello my name is auria
okay
oh okay
is more or less like that but with the exception that here it hardly ever snows but the cold weather comes like in january and last until mid march
then spring starts and that last last like three four weeks and then the heat
exactly
yes well
i'm from puerto rico
yes and you
oh okay well i was born here also i was born in north carolina i was raised there and moved to puerto rico when i was twelve years old
and that's when i learned spanish
auria
i mean to speak spanish because i understood it because my parents would speak to me in spanish but i would always answer them back in english
well me exactly i more or less at fourteen as well because when i was twelve i moved over there but i almost had thirteen years old
and i refused i did not i did not want to have anything to do with spanish i did not want to have anything to do with puerto rico y was very rebellious that they took me away from my
you know my school from my friends
of course you know after one year of not having any friends because nobody spoke spanish well i changedd my mind
north carolina
yes
exactly
well it just depends on the good manners of the person that uses it
it is my opinion i don't think there should be laws that tell you how are you supposed to use it or not
nicole nice to meet you
simply i think that a person should have the good manners to know that if they are at the cinema they should not use it if they are in a restaurant they should not use it
or at lease excuse yourself and go outside
exactly
yes
but if you mean urgent you mean with the permission
i get back in five minutes you know go outside you take the call and and
and yeah but people like you say it not courteous
the only law that i believe should exist is when driving
because i have seen in front of me many accidents happen because the person in front of me was on the phone
they are in the highway and for speaking on the phone they missed their stop their exit their exit
fine fine and you
and so then and they do what i tell you a turn to reach their exit and i have seen accident that happen that way because of that
at least have the ear bud or earpiece as they say
if you're going to be in the car
yes
exactly
oh because that's dismissing the moment that you're with that person
exactly
i i am i agree with you because i think that much technology even if it advances communication as you say at the same time we as a society have the habit
of getting out of the moment
you know with television with videos and what do i know with music
i'm a little bit north of atlanta
well you one doesn't live in this same moment and the telephone sometimes well it distracts you from the moment also and i sometimes refuse to answer the phone
if i am playing with my youngest daughter she is four years old she is only going to be four for another year
you know and i will never be able to go back to that moment
while the person who is calling me well i can talk to them you know
exactly
exactly
exactly and one doesn't
yes it is true but it is that people as you say it is like an obsession or something they always have to answer the phone when it rings
and it is one thing even though they don't talk even a minute but they have to answer the phone the moment it rings
but i don't i don't answer it when i am in a given moment what do i know that i can take the time to talk to the person but if i
oh warm but very nice and where are you from
im making something cooking or reading one book to the girl so you know i let it dream
and after i will call it back look mommy sorry or look someone sorry
exactly
yes i know
exactly
is suppose that yes
no exactly but aha mommy my mommy is teacher also and she pass by much
she teaches spanish at high school also
at esl
ok but the my daughter well she had bad luck with me because she is going to say that i am like old fashion or what do i now because she is not going to have a cell phone
ha from new york
at age twelve or thirteen she is not going to go everywhere with a cell phone
o yes but i i have seen that she is twelve thirteen you know they are going into seventh eighth grade and they look like they are
already grown because they place lots of pressure on parents and well parents give in
and i don't believe in that
i when she is seventeen years old well i buy a phone and ok
and this to call to call me
yes only i am a single mom
and well she is the only one i have so far
yes same as the playstations and that i tell her no no no
has it started being cold or not yet
and when more or less is that autumn starts there and the cold weather arrives
hello
eh like in october autumn begins in other words it feel more like autumn here but the cold
the serious cold starts like in december january in other words in january the snow starts and from then on the cold continues until april so
there's still a little time left til then
mm
of course of course same here in other words the spring is like super short sometimes you don't even notice the spring
cold and then hot
listen and where are you from
from puerto rico
i i was born here in new york but my family is cuban and i also lived in chile for a short time so my spanish is like a mix of things
mm
what's your what's your name
okay
sure the same with me i my my parents always talked to me in english but my grandparents i was raised by my grandparents too because we all lived together and my grandparents
always talked to me in spanish and i would always answer in english and until i mean i started truly speaking at around frouteen years old
of course of course at that age one feels
and where did you live before of of going to puerto rico
where in north carolina i see i see
ehm well and the topic the topic i listened was about cell phones i don't know if to i see because sometimes they are two different topics i have had conversations where the other person hears another things
but i don't know what you think about cell phones if they are bothersome
uhm
hmm
auria hi i'm nicole
yes sure
of course of course obvious obvious the problem is that there are people that do not have that courtesy
i have been in movie theaters where the phone rings at the restaurant where people have or rather there are two people in the restaurant and one is on the phone
or rather if is a urgent thing obviously but i do not understand what urgency
it can't be that that urgent
of course
of course
um yes
uhm
um
nice to meet you how are you
um
um yes yes yes yes i agree absolutely that is driving
of course but have your hands free because one really needs free hands when one is driving i see people
going down the street not paying much attention because you're talking on the phone imagine while you're driving it's much worse that one should have the hands at least
to drive and the other thing in the hospitals that one shouldn't really use the phones in the hospitals because the signals can interfere withe the machines in the hospital
one should turn off the phone in the other places that is that is a matter of being considerate to other people
and and also being being polite to other people that are with you because you are with friends and family and you answer the phone in the middle of a conversation it should be for something important it shouldn't be
that you're with a friend speaking with another friend on the phone you see
sure sure and the the phone is something that it's supposed to improve communication
but i think that it worsens communication if one is always being interrupted by calls
fine where are you
sure sure
with computers
um
of course
but i don't answer i mean if i am with another person unless it is something important or if i know that it is going to be a short call to agree on something but if i am with someone i really don't don't answer the phone
well i live alone so i have time when i'm by myself to talk on the phone alone
and i i believe that when i am with other people i should be with that person i mean like it used to be when there weren't cell phones to talk on the phone at home and not in the street
i mean i don't know it is a little it is like an obsession that people always have to be available
i mean also via email i mean people have those blackberries and they are always ready by email to answer the email and i don't understand what can be so urgent on email
that can not be answered later when you are at home in front of the computer
oh okay and how's the weather over there
um
um ha
um um
off ourse off course that makes sense also with the cellphones one can see who is calling like this like this is don't know i mean if im going to see my girlfriend tomorrow
and the girlfriend is calling me well i answer because i know that we have to take a decision tomorrow
but if it is another person i will call in other time i mean i don't know i mean i believe that it is one thing to have a little of common sense but the people thinks that always the other is that the youngsters im a teacher the younsters
they like the cellphones they always cellphone rings in the class i mean i don't know how many times the cellphone rings in my class
and i say you are in the school not to answer the telephone to learn
also that they are here with all their friends i don't know who is calling i mean one imagine they are from high school but one imagine that the majority of the
youngsters in high school their friends also are in the same school
eh i'm from new york
i mean because those cellphones are calling are the fathers calling them i don't believe
um and what she teaches your mommy at
over there there i teach english for inmigrants
esl o yes that
no twelve or thirteen no it is that my students many already are seventeen eighteen they are rather grown
um um
yes yes
yes
and you only have that daughter
ok
yes i'm here in the city now
but well she is taking good care of her
no not cold it's hot up to now it's been super humid but today is the first day that it hasn't been so humid
good evening how are you i am norma from here in atlanta
oh well no i do not agree that they are driving and talking it is very dangerous i don't know can distract bring or some bad news they can get
i know that they are in shock and there are going to be accidents because of that no
no but i mean on the other side the cellulars have now become more necessary no for any emergency for anything that happens in many cases you can't find the telephone
nearby well at least you have your cellular
and you what do you think
aha
aha
aha
of course
of course that shouldn't shouldn't be i mean i agree when is some emergency no
we find each other again right
there is no but when is something for example in the school why kids need cell phones
no they go to study not to talk with their friends they go to study
no and and when one is handling it's really dangerous that one is you know eh is handling and talking on the phone
yes is goo because as it's said they don't pay attention no but in part is like sometimes is convenient no is has its adantages and disadvantages
right
of course the parents are also the ones that really as they say education starts at home no
the kids and the parents don't sducate they don't used the kids to the good things good manners
o doing really right things
kids won't learn they will not learn understand
mmm
aha
mmm
oh my god
yes
oh yeas
yes
yes people now
they are very addicted to their cell phones
ah if nothing is happening they grab their cell phone to look at or find someone to talk to
clearly
clearly certainly for emergencies right
oh yes
really you don't need one often there aren't many things one needs for example before i had a cell phone
a few years ago there were no cell phones no internet or anything
you were living well then and you didn't lack anything but something was missing
we live in a consumerist society and if it's not that then why
all the advertisement and propaganda i don't know
they trick into thinking that you need something that you don't we don't need them
mhm
ah yes the train too
right nowadays everyone has a mobile everyone walks with his
talking to their mobile talking from here to there
hmm
no
mh
oh yes
of course it's a boy uh huh
oh for sure
of course yes when we go to temple our temple there is also
no over there people have their phones and before beginning the conference the devout tells them please turn off your phones so that they don't interrupt
yes some turn them off no but some there still don't
have and sometimes rings no
ah yes really
what do you say
mm
ah ok
ah yes
ah that could be true
yes in some things no that is good no
but it can be adictive to much
yes reallly
well every day well they call me i haven't made calls
yes me too i know but i don't i
i don't call they call me everyday because there is a cretain amount of call one does
yes yes
i cant only do twenty five calls that's it
i guess i don't know oh because for me yeah
they always call me everyday since i started studying
yes they call me everyday
and one day i got two calls
well yesterday no yesterday on friday i lost a call because when they called i wasn't there
here then i didn't get anymore calls
mhm
aha
well
hello my name is glorisa
do you agree with people that go driving and talking
oh they call you everyday i'm glad
oh i'm glad im glad
oh me too
ha
so i've lost a few amount of calls because i told them i was only here for a few days and sometimes i am sometimes i am not
and the machine they leave a message on the machine and i sometimes forget to pick up the call so they call again
because i tell them that i'm here during the evening so they call late sometimes
aha
aha aha
i don't like it i don't drive and talk i absolutely scream at the people that drive and talk on the phone i go nuts
because they don't pay attention they are on the phone and are not paying attention if they took the light or not or
or or is arguing once i was with my friend and her husband was arguing with her and i said hang up hang up that you are going to kill me by arguing with him
and sometimes now the kids are using them in school we have to take them away is a nuisance the cellulars in the school they lose them we have to look for them
we have to mark them they go crazy as if it was the last bill in the pocket oh and sometimes they don't respect don't respect the teachers
the teachers tell them to turn them off they don't turn them off they leave them on vibrator is a problem a really bad problem specially in school
all those kids and they lose them they get lost we collect like like twenty or twentyfive cellulars even though we tell them not to bring them to school
oh fine and you
they still bring them
they still bring them
exactly
exactly
aha
exactly
yes of course but if if you know what i told a mother one day you know you should not send it with the cell phone
ah but that's the way i contact him and i told her look he can use here the phone in the office any tiem he wants
yes it's an emergency you call here and we'll look for him
she told me not but you think you are that that i bought him the cell phone so he keeps it on top of the table that if is i said look
aha hey last night i spoke with another lady lady that dreamed like you but she was from phiadelphia
then i'll tell the principal to start taking them away take it awaya first because if if one of the of the laws of the school is not to bring
is not to bring a cell phone he is not you are sending him with the cell phone you are guilty because he gets punished and they are not punished yet they should be punished
well bad so the don't do it again
eh yes yes yes
aha
yes
exactly yeah
this let me see that i'm so tired i ran to parties this weekend and i'm really tired and let me this is a
i will tell you that yesterday i trowed a party
and she called asking me to arrive later and well i wasn't finding the place she kept calling like 15
her name was silvia and we talked about the same we talked about the cell phone
times in less than 3 minutes
and i left the phone ringing i said i would not let this lady cause me and accident
only to get to her party fast and i was really close from her home she told me to go to the other side
and after that i was two blocks away from here she told me no it's somewhere else other time i will not listen to her
and i will follow the address i have online
i get there really easy next time i would not even call her she was driving me crazy with the damn cellphone
oh my god
yes yes yes
yes yes it's true it's true my husband always tells me i'm not going to buy a new phone because you always leave it here
you believe that you owe it to be as important a load as your wallet and i say i'm not going to carry it as my wallet because
yes
my baby is the most important thing to me and he's in school and if something happens there call me
and if something happens to you the ambulance calls me so i have to have a phone if that happens we saw an accident once on the highway
then you know it will come
yes yes yes
i know right
exactly
yes
aha
yes yes exactly and how they do it the ipo is another thing
everyone seem to have that music into their ears and all that oh my god and in the cinema there too he told that we had to talk about
and do you remember the cell phone
if they use it in the cinema they put that in cinemas and manage to ruin your movie when you go there
yeah i don't even go there and say i'm through hearing all the people talk on their mobiles in the cinema they do it in trains too as if it were
their home
you can hear like all of their conversation the one you have closer and the one in front of you
i don't like that either my mobile phone i leave it vibrating and if the one that calls me can way until
i go off the train i'm not very manic my friends say hey gloria what you have i say look at the road
you go at fifty and talking and i don't think that you can see the road and talk at the same time i find rather strange because when i
i don't get on the highway but whenever i go my mind has to be on the road not talking to someone
to the phone oh i'm getting crazy with those phones they drive me mad
i know
we need to talk about the cell phone
i know i know i didn't let my little to have have one in school has it for emergencies only
so then he tells me mom but if an emergency happens i'll tell you then i tell him you go and since i work in the school they let you call me
they know that you are my son
they let you call me you know but we restrict the telephone to everyone so that the cellphones don't come and still
they don't care and you tell them to not use them and they are in the hallway they go into the bathroom
in the hallway they go behind the door oh these kids are horrible horrible oh my god horrible even in church there is a poor woman
her cell phone rang as if it was a bell and even when the priest was praying he stopped and said what's that a door
and he made it into a joke
but he made it like a joke so then he said when one goes to church it is to pray not to ask the ringing phone
so she felt very bad and went outside afterwards when she went outside and the phone rang again and everyone began to laugh
about the cell phones
because this woman was already i said ugh that she is interrupting the concentration that you have in church yo know so
ha
ah and the people still don't turn them off right
some will pay
i know what a lack of respect right
like the don't listen to the adults that is the reason why the kids won't listen either
because they follow their mother and father examples you know i am so tired now i am i am helping my baby with his homework
we are writting breakfast too he has to write eight sentences of celular because he has cellular and can leave without celular and can use in the theater
can you it when he goes dancing that this that can be used with games now i use the cellular like a calculator
because can i use as a calculator
and do you like it
yes the only bad thing is that if i can not find the celilar i don't remember really i put a reminder to let me know that
i had an appoitment in the reason is good yes
i got him ja
i know
anyway continue talking that i am tired oh my god you had call to much had they were to many calls had you call or they also call you
oh because you you can make them too you know
ha
exactly
so you cant or cant be the twenty five everyone keeps calling you don't call

yes the the internet it can be very useful and also it could be very bad because like you said the information that is good but also information that is bad right
oh of pornography and everything is es of everything like that
yes
yes that's why you must be wise
but is incredible to communicate with someone or to learn about something
yes
and like you said one can have access to many things with the encyclopedia

time is up and i say no how can you say that
yes
hello good evening i'm lorena
of using the internet and at the end said to give your opinion and talk about that and maybe we can get to know people by this medium we are in right now
no yes yes
sure
yes me neither and finally i unders i don't understand that word
i i push the four because i understand it's a no a phone without wires wireless
i hope that's it anyway i already passed the test test accomplished and they patch me through and then hey do you have a lot of family in chile all your relatives
by the phone that i have been very positive to me he has sign look i never thought him to be so funny
very interesting well only three or four persons
but for me it is like a full adventure
from mexico mexico city
and you
ah from chile how good the chilean empanadas
sure
yes my husband studied his masters in mexico city
there was like the latin american academy of social sciences
paulina hi how are you
there were students from all the latin places and then there was only an opportunity when a chilean friend invited us the argentian friend takis us to eat some dishes no
yes this empanadas great things you can't forget them
yes and where are you talking from
form georgiai'm in san antonio texas
and how long have you been here
wow 11 and 2 years
well starting my live here and you arrived her to study o how was it
mm
oh that's nice really nice right
yes two years because we were waiting for our children to finish their middle education
the same i was going to ask you because you couldn't hear too good it wasn't clear i understood something about the internet
mm in mexico they finished high school and now they are here in high school
yes yes and this and
i have two they are now with me and an older one who is studying in university she has left home already
she has already been studying two years in pennsylvania
yes she is studying chemical engineering
yes and a lot of work how great but well there there she has to be and you what did you study
ay how great microbiology i like it very much very much
yes yes yes yes yes i i studied social anthropology and also to be an english teacher
mmm i was a teacher in mexico
but well definitively the situation here in the sense of salaries and what not is much much better and also i have some family here in
of the
in san antonio then well they went
giving things like yes yes yes do you have a kid now
ohhh
yes yes yes so you are not working for now
sure well enjoy it
yes yes i can hear that that's a good way to use your time
so how many people have you met this way
yes i have gone through that too like two or three times
the call breaks down or fails to
yes and after that there's no on the other side exactly
no no but it wasn't clear if i was attending
oh yeah
yes but but thisis interesting isnt it i say i didn't understand him
at the beginning and now that he has been talking he really is
that one retrieves the importance of talking right
because in this life with all the rush and all the hurry and with so many activities well sometimes i don't even telephone my friends to say hi or to see how they are doing right
well then one has to value that it it is important
yes yes yes yes yes
but one dedicates some minutes to washing dishes for example to like to call on the phone like this one is its important
yeah yeah
yes
and i really didn't hear anything and it was very difficult hard
yeah
yes and and this of internet well this is another of the questions well it is a marvelous thing
eh me not so much but my children and especially the youngest one is always attached
and the most important thing is that the computers they are a marvelous thing right
they facilitate the access to the information
i have tried the encyclopedia of of paper well it has become a decoration article
yes yes yes they are beautiful
bad information right everything that is knows also of
exactly what a terrible thing right yes yes yes
yes
i was making all the points before getting the call but the last thing i understood was that the advantages something like that like which ones have been
yes or someone in chile who you can send an email or something like that right
those parents too
yes yes yes come in and go directly into the kitchen there you'll find some medicine and even a natural remedy
even microbiology physics or whatever right
yes aja
ah exactly and i came out happy right and and i remember that
yes the other day for the pumpkin pie right during halloween
no man there must have been like thirtyfive different recipes
well then to choose one and prepare it
yes and how is he
the most important dates in your life i understand and which ones have been the least important and then he said something about the internet that in your opinion
we didn't find out over this medium the phone calls and everything
aha so i truly liked that and it resulted newfangled it's incredible
then those ones are trying again to stick us that the phone is useful and important no
talking to people
my daughter in the university of pennsylvania
yes you too
aha
ah okay
that was nice listen talking about that
the other day i had to talk with a gentleman that lives in new york but his parents are puerto rican
which are the advantages and disadvantages
its hard to understand it and you i am not going to have some problem like we have to speaking i say is they eat the letters and change the words and
and they talk very fast that work tell me the same mister that start the call no
not so a flat yes
someone talk good spanish
yes
yes
no yes yes yes or for example when it says wait in the line
how does it say i forgot now hold on
yes yes yes
it's good you said that i haven't told them i never thought about that
good evening my name is and i live in connecticut
ah
the conversation is about the internet do you use internet
mmh
aha aha
mmh
yes it is good i li i use it too to find work to look for information for the girl in school but to
for things of to find people on the internet i don't like that
i don't believe in in in that of i believe you find there are many crazy people lots of lots of trash of that kind that that they put on the internet and
it happens then that it is not what it seems there are many people who have used it and and they have gotten married and all but i i have never entered to
to chat rooms what they say
oh miami ah and how are you
i have never talked to anyone
it wasn't truth
okay okay okay
okayokay
and that that has also meant a lot of troubles for couples i think
because it has brought many couples apart as husbands become or women go online and meet people and spend hours and hours and hours and more hours are lost to the internet
i don't i don't use it that way but my niece sends me jokes from puerto rico and and my son sends me pictures of the baby the new baby and that's why i like the service a lot
because i can see my granddaughter very often and follow her life month to month
okay okay
yes the pictures it's it's lovely i love them but also uhm what i don't like so much is as they were saying you know you know that you send pictures and they keep them like in a
good thanks is the baby sleeping
the file is there for a certain time and then afterward i think that after six months or something similar it is delete
the program like erases them if you have not taken them out
ah well when i don´t what i do is that i don´t leave them on the computer i put them on a cd
and i put the date on it and we put a i do a label on it then that way i have them if someone comes from the family then we put them on the tv and on the computer
sure sure yes because if you leave them on the computer that takes a lot of megabytes i think
sure
sure
sure
sure yeah
yes
it's going to be at rest at least
yes you can ca but you have i think that the cd program is to see it en the tv then you buy a cable i think that to the camera and
and and you have it in the te in the television that's what we do whenever we have a party then we put it
in the cd later when the family comes you put it we met and everyone sits in the room and it they see it eh in the television it looks very pretty
because it's a bigger screen too and if you put music
then it it looks pretty for that reason i like the the internet but for the others of of pair they do not take me
no but you see those children that sometimes are taken that is that that they know these crazy people on the internet
he here was a baby that is that a type is deceptive and no from new jersey ah that he was just over forty years old and the baby had what they were fifteen years
and took him lucky that they could take but i will know god if t he takes it and kills it and i don't really like either of the questions about the babies sometimes
it's a separate room that you use like an office
mhm mhm
oh that's good
yeah
yes they when you leave they change the screen what are you doing well sometimes i tell my grandkids what are you doing no nothing just hanging out
and i'll open the other screen they had open to see
but you have to be watching because the computer is a bit it's got lots of good things but it's also got its negatives
because look all this information that sometimes is provided for them like terrorists making bombs even some students that that killed people in columbine school
they got their ideas from the i from the internet so sometimes i mean its got its its good side like everything like everything they got it's got it's good points and later there are other points that well
that are disastrous too
ah yea ah yea
yes now now well now they've invented lots of parental control type things and all those things that
that at least one with that can control them a little more than before but before when none of that existed well you know that the kids would get in in the chat rooms eh open up twenty thousand things
good i was watching a small program on tv i like to watch on wednesdays
mm
oh is is people that eh when i think that if you leave your password and you don't close it when you go to look at your email
if you don't closes it well fast let's suppose you go to cook or do something and you leave it like that an open space
many there are many men that many people that know how to get your get your password from that moment that you leave it there for a long time that's why they say that as soon
as soon as you leave the computer well to close it do you understand me to make sure that nobody gets your information well then what they do that when they already get your password they start sending
these emails that that sometimes what they bring are viruses and sometimes they bring dirty things
so it all depends on i mean at least you have to be very careful with the with the passwords and with the information specially the one from the bank and all that
when they sometimes they send you asking for information that they say to put your pin number again because
there you have to be very careful
aha
oh i have allergies but apart from those i take vitamins to remove the symptoms
oh yes well that's the the identify theft well that's being used a lot now in
on the internet everything gets stolen there the personality because of this you know that sometimes they tell you to take who knows you or those free things that offer you a thousand free things on the internet and you go and start to __ it and then
when you begin to wonder about the data and all the name of your mother the date of birth and all these things then it is not good to give this information
oh
no
hello
but
anyway i n
i did it it is like i i use it everyday there we eh you know we have email we have eh eh we do everything that we have to do with the bank
i look for information recipes i go to the library
i don't buy much but if we are going to buy something i always do like eh some research
eh searching for products to see where i can get the best price so that internet for us it is it is it is like you know like having an
encyclopedia let's say
at home
no me neither
well i
this is annie of miami we have spoken before
yes eh and
i before uhm used to log into chat rooms but they weren't you know to look for people or whatever they offered various topics
but it wasn't uhm you know after a while i didn't like it because people acted like i don't know they said stuff
that they
yeah or things they normally wouldn't say you know things got ugly
and i didn't like it at all so after a while about a month or two i stopped but because i would rather talk to people not you know
stand there in front of a machine
but you know i have one
yes
yeah that's something that we do too we take pictures of the little girl and we send them to all our friends and well not every month currently but it used to be every month
good and you
and i like that a lot because that way at least people that we know our family that's away they can see how she's growing
yeah it's that that's something we do a lot i had forgotten about the pictures
well with us already my little girl is nearly two years old and never it has never disappeared for us the photos still are there it´s that it depends you know
on what you are using but we still have pictures on the internet of of from when from my baby shower
ah very smart sure
ah very good what a good idea
well i always make copies before putting it on the computer
oh i mean on the internet i always make a copy on cd and all that
then like that i have the originals that we took we take a bit more than a hundred every month
but i don´t put on the internet any more than let's say thirty or forty then i keep the originals and those that i put on the internet because the one that i put on the internet are already there
that's good yes thank god
you know fixed up you know those are the best that's why i always have two two categories of cd's then if she when she grows up if she wants all the photos i am able to put it in for her look these are the best and these are the the originals that you want
that way she has them but
i had never thought about putting it in in the television
yes
mhm eh eh yes that's a good idea
yes
to me to me either and and that too like what you said before that you know one never know who is going to know
yes
either if that is something that that i already know that when you know my boy is not more more we are going to say older than the computer goes to
the i am going to have to change the room that is because right now we have it like in a not in the office but we're going to say that is what we are calling it
yes at this hour i put her to sleep
and
yes but i want to put it we are going to say in the room or you know somewhere where they are they are using it i can see
all that they are doing because like before i was masterful i know you know the the what the children do
like they hide things from their parents and and not that
i don't mean to say that my ch
yes it's
so yea
ah
yes
it all depends on how you use it you know yes that but no i i i love the internet but i know too that when
and you how are you
you know you start to n no you start to but when the kids start to use it you have to be a bit different
you know because i think pretty often they don't
yes
well and still that that happens even if you have the parental controls because many times when i'm going to look in my email you know and i know this would happen to some of my students that they are going to open the email
and pictures come out of you know of naked women whatever
and and that's something that bothers me a lot that i don't know how you can change that do you know
yes
yes
no thank god we you know nothing like that thru the computer has happened to us but someone did steal the the number of of
social security
ah that's good my cold is giving me a very bad sore throat
of my husband a few years back and we had a lot of problems
because
that's what it says but since i'm pregnant i can not take a lot of things
so i'm you know i'm not feeling very well today
hi good evening uh i am nicole i am calling from new york
about the telemarketing i do not like it i do not know who like it
people call to sell anything eh i don't know
eh i think they are talking about when they call you
when they call you by phone and sell things and also when
when they send emails
of course the spam
so i don't know not know if that convinces someone i've never bought anything there and i never have looked any email seriusly
i don't know and
yes i have bought things online but no
of course
hi how are you
of course well must be must be effective
you have to look at those emails and then you have to get convinced otherwise not
um
of course
mhm of course
i don't know yeah yeah i've tried using those lists that say they dont call
i mean there's some that you can subscribe too and they don't call you but i dont know
i'm subscribed they sometimes call me
but not so much not as much as before
um yeah i just tell them i cant really talk right now i just don't wan na listen to their stories because i wont be buying anything anyways
good good we spoke before right
i'm not going to go buy
mm
yes yes yes also
yes
yes it must be a terrible job my sister did that type of work like for a week
and she came home every day crying because everyone
of course no nobody wants to listen to you
in other words everybody hangs up on you and she would get home so upset that she stopped working like that in a week
no besides they pressure you when you have a job like that they pressure you
ah to sell i mean they are like listening to you while you make the call the bosses are listening to you
no no i spoke with someone from atlanta
to see how you are selling and if you are not
sure and if you are not very efective they pay less so its like a bad job sometimes i feel a little sympathy for those people
sure its like that they are trying to win money too but i don't i dont want to give them money that's the problem
i don't know if is i answer the surweys i mean if i was called with surwey that's what i want to know
that if i am going to vote for who i am going to vote i don't know what to think about the politic sitution now that's is what i answered in the surveys
i thinks that's good that they have a thoughts diversity
and i like to contrubuite with something because for the research or for
sure but you don't have asking me money only answers thoughts no money
sure so i also don't want it what it is selling me the newspaper i mean i read the internet news
and i don't want newspapers in my home
but i don't know
ehh and i don't know what else they are sell ensurance policy i dont want
mmm you won a car
you only need to go to miami to pick it up
of course
of course no the majority of those things
yes they all go out to win money because if it was not for that they will not be winning
someone needs to pay the salary to those people
mm of course that is the other thing that sometimes
they call and they leave a message and say that you have to call certain number to go get your prize
and the number turns out that is a number that charges you a fee for having called
what country are you from
so it is like one of those 900 900 numbers that they charge you for having called so that
mm
i believe that is cheap or i beleive that is cheap for the company to do this type of publicity or maybe they pay too little
to to the people that are calling
in fact many time people that are calling are not even in the united states
but they have communication systems
it allows for people to call you from india
and one does not know like they speak english in india
oh like they do outsourcing
like they pay people in those countries to call you and sell you stuff can you imagine
a yeah eh
the little that they should be paying this people
they are making the calls if they make one or two sales for each person same they are making money or if they do for that because they can not
or they do not sell a lot that way but since they pay little to employees they earn a little that is why
of course since it is a very poor country
um i heard that once that when like help desk when you have a problem with your computer or something like that and you call to help that many times people who are answering they are in india
mmh
of couse sometimes communication is very bad
of course or sometimes like there is a delay like you hear but don't hear
in any case what happens with that communication if i am calling the phone company and the communication is bad but it is that they are far that is incredible
incredible to think that because they are even in another timezone there must be twelve hours difference with india
i well my family is cuban
of course or or they work at night
that people have to call much more during the day that at night here so those people must be calling at night i say or working at night there
i mean if it is three o'clock in the afternoon here
good no um maybe not or perhaps it is better for these people to do something else
it's not very clear there is lots of talk on this issue that gives
there is not so much to tell
yes
dating that's because they translated it from english
is a machine which is translating from english to spanish
the dating i was listening too the dating that will be of the dating
eh but i was born here in the united states
and then i though in english date is date and dating the dating
what what a slip in other words a a language study
it's it's supossed to be a linguistic study
and they can't translate the word to spanish right
hello good evening
oh okay and so then what do you think about the nol
yes
no is is is referring to is referring to teleshopping those that seem to popups on the internet who call you
ah when they call you bu phone
ah
ah spam yes
huh
yes
ah no neither do i i do not think i have bought things online i've never bought things online online
but not those sent by spam
hi i am norma here from atlanta georgia
no not other things you actually need not
no why
yea of course i'm sure people invest in that not just for that they worry about sending those emails and the
and the small companies o i know who does that so you invest money doing that
of course by phone yes by phone yes it bothers me specially when someone is busy
ha its annoying
ha
yeah i'm sure they do
mhm i'm pretty sure they do sometimes and the people that sell are very emphatic
ha
good and you
of course i'm not interested
yes sometimes there are people and sometimes there is how do you say scams what they are called that they sell them something and sometimes at the end is not even true also you have those
fraudulent things they offer
they offer selling by phone and even by internet also
ah yes yes a lot of families there that are employed
nobody wanted to buy
yes not even listen to you
of course it's really a job that it's not it doesn't really reward you much more like it gets you bitter
of course
yes
uh i don't know
they for sure pay them on commission
yes sometimes i think is a good job for them they are doing as every other job
mmm
ok
mmm
sure
mmm how research
sure because now you never know who really is no true who is lying
yes
sure vacations
yeah yes
yes that that is really
yes like you won this but you need to send certain amount of money to secure your prize
one question
mhm
of course
yes it really needs to be careful and no
no
yes
mm
oh and on top of that everyone has to pay long distance call charges so really one needs to be careful after all no but paying a lot of people because they want more business
mhm
this is not for a publicity stunt that they say
yes
a yes yes that is true
mhm
oh yes just
yes and the accent they have
yeah
um
sure because in india they do pay much that is why
of course because in in india it is a completely different way of life and there you pay pay less to people
i am i am from peru
aha then those people are anxious to work at any job no
yes yes it is true even eh here the big ones for example here the telecommunications company here in the south bell south
no and always sometimes my husband calls i call for a problem with the telephone with our internet and yes yes the people you call who answer in india
no yes mmh of course and you sometimes don't understand because they don't speak
mmh mmh
of course now yes
i suppose there are people who work i don't know all the time no
or they work yes they work at night
yes something like that mmh
it's good to see that they clearly have to spend more than twelve minutes
and you
mhm
sure like the last time they called about the dates
they call it dating
yes it is a
is a question not a question i told what's dating i didn't understand it very well
yes
yes instead of dating
ay yeah
of course
sure sure that that isn't that the best of all that they don't even present the complete or right translation
yeah
hello good afternoon

what do i work for
no uh no i don't work my husband does
i'm with the childs here at home well now they left
ah here i am norma from atlanta georgia
they left me here alone to rest
i have two two young men that are
two men
they are you can already imagine how it is no men are always more active boys
ah you have
ah and and you are not married
ah aha
ah okay
ah there is where he is right in
ah you see i'm fortyone
good and you we spoke yesterday right
mm
he doesn't seem to be the the right person
mhm
mhm
mhm
yes he's still young
yes well when you get married it's different it's
no and you have like more obligations
it's not the same freedom as before specially if you have kids
mhm
ah okay ahyes yes
sure that's right that's true but standing or at least being decided
no next to his a little bit more or to deprive herself of her freedom it must be like that i suppose
yes
mhm
mm
that is right you are right about that
when the children are young are babies and no i don't have time not even for eating or taking a bath
aha
ah yes little baby
sure small babies are like that right mhm
yes yes i believe we spoke
that is right when children are babies you have to be with them all the time
oh my sons are one is seven and the other is three
yes they're little still
they're children aren't they and
hmm
of course of course enjoy enjoy while you can and
of course because otherwise there one of
yes he is american he is brown american
i got married am he is too he just lives in the temple
he's from the same religion then that's where we met
yeah
ah i'm from the hare krishna movement
hey i haven't heard that
mm
yes we are vegetarians there isn't
really there are many temples in peru there are a lot worldwide
yes of course
they are vegetarian since the womb
no it's in
so far no when they are young they are taught to be vegetarians
if not they don't ask and don't have any tendencies when they are teenagers they start to ask themselves question and nobody can force them to do anything is up to them
yeah
they have free will they are not kids and they get old
no they have to choose or have to see
ah yes mhm
mhm
ah
ah really
ahhhh
when they eat heavy
mm
right is more more healthy no
yes that is what i was thinking
is healthier and even his digestion is better
hmm
no no we don't eat meat eggs or fish
no and you're still with the same boyfriend
ah ok now maybe the other one the other boyfriend you should suggest it out of nowhere he's not inclined to eat meat and you can make him a vegetarian it's easier if you're a vegetarian
hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
sure because no and i do not think that someone is in agreement with telesales
well some people are inclined to that it's a habit they were born raised that way no
they are used to eat meat and they don't know that there are other alternatives they might have heard something but they never imagined it's like that no
if you are a vegetarian you really have nothing to envy from them you have nothing to envy people that eat meat i've been a vegetarian for twenty years
no and i really you feel great you are healthy no you don't even look your age
yes vegetarian
no but it is different aha
sure it's heavy and difficult to digest the human body is not made for that no to eat meat it's not made for meateating
yes because when you are starting to become a vegetarian you really don't know how to balance your diet
sure i mean you have to eat proteins because if you don't
find you don't eat meat
hello
no eh are you peruvian
mm
mm
of course and milk and yogurt and that all
that ok ok
of course of course like you get used to and already

asian food in general i like it a lot
chinese food japanese food but well i like it i like fish i do

mm
i'm twentyseven years old

no not yesterday because i did not make calls yesterday but we spoke before

sure
sure because because it is a lot of work and if one has a family is a lot of work
and i like to be alone i tell you i like i like quietness i like to think and read
i think that when i when i have children
uy it is going to be very difficult to do those things
so
sure sure i went to visit a friend who has a daughter
the daughter is about about six weeks old
so little one and i don't know my friend always with the baby so she doesn't leave
but i do not remember about this issue maybe same issue about telesales
so she is with her all the time but she is very happy but it is a great responsibility until they grow a little
hmm and how old are you huh your sons
ah i see
of course of course this
how beautiful to have have children i mean having familiy is like i think that is the most beautiful of life
i don't know in a few years from now i'm going going to leave i'm going to leave calmness
of course
and your and your husband ah you meet him here in the united states
ah i see
aham
yes we spole i believe it was friday
i see and what religion is it

yes i studied at college i studied budhism
it have similar things right
and in peru there is also hari krishna it must be
and children are also vegetarian right
hey
and they never ask for meat or anything
no
of course
we spoke about the same issue how stupid
of course
right right
yes i was a vegeterian for many years
like 10 years that i was vegetarian but then i went to chile i was living with my boyfriend there and really and it was difficult continuing been vegetarian
that he ate beef and if i made something vegetarian
and he put like a piece of meat in the middle like he didn't want to eat like that
i left it it was complicated and and when i come back and continue i won't eat to much meat like
well m never at the house i cook beef only
right i eat out or i go to the house of some else and made something but at mine house only vegetables and i don't know green vegetables
i like it mm i prefer to eat like that
what else are we saying
meaning
mm
hmm yes not really i don't like meat much i like fish
i don't know do you eat fish
no not fish but meat itself is not attractive to me
no no we broke up
i've never been in a relationship with someone who is a vegetarian never
and i've had like five boyfriends
like serious boyfriends
i mean more or less serious
well lets talk about something else because what can we say we are not going to have the same conversation as before
but they all ate meat and they liked meat even the current one too
he likes hamburgers and chicken
mm sure
mm
mm
sure
yes i don't i rather not because
meat makes you fill full it's heavy
mm but people are used to eat meat they feel hungry so they eat meat
mm sure you have to be careful make sure you eat proteins
hello how are you aha we want to talk about what i didn't understand very well the
aha because i am ready to i don't know if you know there is a list that you place your name on
with the government and they can not call you yes i believe that list still exists and i don't know where
they can send it yes but they can not call me
the do not call list that started like a like two two and a half years so the government used that list because they were saying that complaining
that many calls during the nap and at a certain time of the day and all that you understand so i put my number on that list
no not to solicit no but if i don't pay my bills they do call me
yes if i don't pay my bill they call me and that and also the mail the mail they are going to do many things you see
and i don't know if you have a computer but if you have a computer they send you a lot of
aha
mm
aha no because the phone you have to get another phone because my phone i have the volume i can not i have to increase the sound
and what country are you from you say that how many years have you been here in the united states
a year wow what country you're spanish right coz i'm hispanic from latin america
yes but in panamá in panama is commercial good a small country got it
yes yes but panama is much more evolved compared with costa rica yes yes have allot
oh yes eh
yes yes then the puerto rico is the most democratic country on the american continent
it doesn't have and army and all it's politics the costa rica politic is the most it's the most pacific one
i tell you the truth on a map close to united states there they have a different party and every party rules a year or two or three ruling and then another one and they do it right
without army and nothing that a government must use force got it
ah but o lot of people doesn't know but in panama we have lots of businesses more developed
ah i heard you well but i didn't hear what the machine was saying
go through panama canal and you will see people from around the world in panamá from all over the world and you have a lot of people that comes there
i was working with the right boats with the big boats as they say junk ship and wanted to be right and they stayed in panama
and they do not return to their country so that many many people who could not and have had problems with thepolicies at home and when they are working on the ship
when they came to panama you know how they say they arrive by ship and mixed with the panamanians and them
ah like three thousand the entire country like three thousand
yes it's a small country yes a country but it has well developed business
yes very small with only three thousand dollars three thousand people that are there but not three million of that there
three million three million no no no that's three million not three thousand because a friend was here in in in in new york right brooklyn and was i was in business in a library
a library of business and i noticed the books eh phones yellow of spain right and you know what a yellow yellow book a phone book is the phone numbers
the yellow right the yellow of all spain is not very bigh like it is in brooklyn and brooklyn is a small part of the united states it is in the city of new york which has five boroughs rightg
yes yes well it speaks spanish with a gringo accent you understand
brooklyn one of the boroughs and the page entered in spanish isn't there
yes yes about thirty but i've been here more than thirty years here yes yes i've been here many years here and i am more american than latin
very good too the thing depends on the person and
education and the people that you're with all the time you understand because if you've been to university of something like that you still keep on talking in that way you understand because i'll tell you the truth
ah i have a teacher a teacher here from right i went to brooklyn college she was the a teacher of a teacher of of spanish teaching spanish
but her class was spanish literature you understand like don quixote lazarillo de torme and all that
and i don't remember lazarillo de torme the first the first picaresque novel
the thing is that she's the worst teacher i have had in my whole life and she learned spanish from the book not speaking at home
like the machine the machine that you heard about but she speaks better than the machine see but she knew a lot of spanish very well she had to study so much in spain that when the moors she had guts and all that
she had to visit certain how do you say it in new york we have a museum right
well the situation also in spanish there are there are many words and ah not only words but of
where they teach you a lot about spanish architecture see and the influences that the moors have had ah in the influence of spain there is and we have certain words like the word ojala it's arabic yes
yes because when they say i hear you say i hope that we go to the movies tomorrow and something like that the movie right
ojala i hope that but what i am saying is oalá god allah you understand but that it is a different thing but talking about telemarketing and spam you say that you don't get much ah
no no email right oh please oh believe me oh i get through i have yahoo which one do you have
oh please
and not not just horrible but those people are like how you say it in english right i am saying it i am telling you practically ok they are as you say creative

or that they tell you things that you want to look at what is inside i tell you that they are like how you say it ah
imagination yes their imagination they are so
aha
from different countries from different regions that say certain things they call it different you understand because i am here here in new york and i was talking with

fifty thousand fifty millions and i did not tel and i that that that they are crazy and they are from many countries they say and many say that they are from nigeria nigeria and ehm ehm
aha
oh
puerto ricans and they call it the orange
but and the thing ehm i don't think that the government culd how it could be it could not know who i the person that is sending who i what is doing that
yes and also the thing that when they send all of those letters if ehm it is difficult when say well ehm well you know that what they are trying to achieve you bukcs understand you money but

yeah
hello
ah loo what part of new york
um
whoch part of new york
ah in
yes
yes
i don't like it
and you uh
yes me neither me neither i think it's always bothersome more than anything
it must be they must make some money with that otherwise they would not do it
i mean
hello
um
how
hum
not not there must be people that sometimes i think are alone like older people yes he is alone and
and like likes to talk
they could start to talk also sometimes older people are like they are more confused like they can
he can convince them a little more
but i think that most of the young people now i don´t know i don´t know there must be young people who could be convinced but i think that very busy people don´t want to loose their time in
in having a conversation like that
well they are in my email and go to the folder as something different
eh i am nicole from new york
the email does that like automatically
yes like that i don´t even see it i don´t even open that folder is like it is there always and is the site deletes it after thirty days or something like that
some times almost never i go to look at them but they arrived for hundreds for example right now there are like two hundred and fifty and i get bored just looking
uhm yes
maybe in the spam file
sure
yes
that's good what service do you use
what email do you have
uhm well a never openuh an spam email but i check the list just to see if some other person has been called
and you nicole
mm i do not open them because i think
uhm yes
if that is what they say sure i don't know if that really happens i believe that we have to open open de email and open the attachment too as a
a file and we have to open something that comes together with the email too
because if don't i don't think it can send a virus in that form for just simplu sending the email
i see
mmm
yes yes
yes they are selling and pornographic things also
i don't know pilds
nicole
mm
mmm
well it must be people i don't know that there is people i mean that let themselves get conviced by those things like they allow
i don't know i know a woman that that yes there are some emails that talk about someone i don't know there are some emails that say that someone from the government
need help and if one puts money eh they are going to retunr more i don't know like ten times mores or something like that and yes i know a woman
i mean yes well she always believes and she is not very well she is like little crazy and she always believes
she always believes and she lost a lot of money
yes yes that is true that is i mean selling things i believe many people don't buy but they say
that one is going to earn a lot of money the if one sends money they are going to return a lot more i believe there are people who dream about it
like that
nicole nicole no no it is not a spanish name
sure sure sure there is always people that believe that
there are the only ones in the world who are going to earn with that then there are people that dream about it
it is like like gambling i mean there are people who gamble and think they are going to earn a lot of money despite everybody in the world loosing with that
sure sure but always there are people who still are going to gamble and they think they are going to be rich
and well well with betting some do make money there must be a few but a few
of course
of course or poker also a bit or not
yes poker i think has it is like
it is like psychological poker because you have to pretend like you have more than you do have or less than you have i don't know
it is like a game like of
what is your name
of course um
of course no no this is like
of course
ha look
hah
look
i think it's good that people earn money because people always lose money there should be some that earn it
uhm
yes and i'm registered
yes they call me sometimes but less i mean less than before and it takes a while to start working like like it takes a few months
pilar and where from where are you from
and after that you notice it they tell you eh we're going to put you on the list and the list starts in three more months or something
but after that you notice less calls
there are still people who call i don't know but
hmm
hmm
uh
sure
yes yes i believe that of course i don't think not all companies do
not all of them pay attention to the list i don't now maybe not all of them have the list i don't know i don't know who gets that list
er maybe it's less like i don't know i don't know if you put your name there put your number there
ah look eh and where are you now
but they call you anyways
uh
oh that's good
uh
uh
um uh
of course of course
of course
of course
um of course
hello
yes um
ah which part of madrid eh oh in manhattan
well we need to talk we getting away and we are not going to get paid today's theme is telesales no
and what do you think
when they call you on the phone to sell you something
nothing at all of course
i don't know anybody that that that likes it actually i don't know anybody that ever bought anything on on the phone
let's see i think that somebody must buy something otherwise
yes of course they must make a little because i
never heard of anybody not annoyed and i think it hurts them more
hello what is your name
because is like negative publicity for them
because if they are calling people to their homes and bothering them
well people is not giving good opinion basically not
yes well yes
you can get convinced to sell them something
yes sadly
of course of course and spam just
of course
and then is less annoying
and don´t don´t you check it to see if
what is your name
i do check it every time i go over the spam email cause it happened to me some times that an email was not a spam
most people don't check his spam file it happened to me once i wrote to somebody
and a have no answer
and that was because it was in his spam file and he did not check it before he erased it got it
i checked some times almost always it is ok there are only spam in that file
i don't get spam in my inbox
what
i have several yahoo and hotmail yahoo is good because spam is very protected and you do not get viruses
no but some times you can get emails from people you know and they are viruses
and you can not open them that's good
ni ni
the what
yes
i don't know you have tu download all the file but that's what hotmail don't let you do it doesn't let you download the file
because the truth is that it has many tricks the emails those of virus and often seems that if it is a a person that you meet that is sending you something interesting
and it is a virus so we have to be careful and the ones that send internet advertising i mean the ones that send spam they are really selling things
i don't understand that who buy to them
yes almost always
yes all the illegal they sell by that way
eemm pills that are not approved that promise miracles and people believe it
who can believe that
nico nico i don't understand you but it is not spanish no
yes sure
that got trapped
because that is very dangerous that is very dangerous because there are lots of people who lost money that way
yes that yes there are people who got trapped
thas is the lack of intelligence that is the absence of thinking because they are going to send me money for free and how is that i am recieving myself from all the people in the world who have an email and
yes
sure
yes practically the bank the casino would not exist
yes
the ones who go to have fun for a day those who go because they don't have an addiction and they need to play and those who dedicate themselves professionally because there are certain games i think that you hear a game blackjack
i am pilar
in which you have probabilities if you play well of making money
what i don't know
i believe that it goes but i suppose that
well poker i don't know i saw a documentary with people from mit who had their tricks to count cards which is illegal of course the casino is very smart for one thing that you can do to beat the casino they forbid it
and it not cheating really cheating would be well marking the cards having
cards under the sleeve but if you are capable of counting cards why is it going to be cheating then it arrived there from casino to casino so they wouldn't get caught
winning a little bit on each not making a lot in each casino not to call attention but they ended up catching them and now they are not allowed to enter the casinos
and they had to go to europe to win at casinos in europe
it was funny
but but if nobody will
pil pilar
of course no one will just give you money people want to believe it
and it's it's very unusual that someone gives you something very unusual they always want something in exchange and the lists have you ever put your phone
and does it work
good
the problem with the list is that it's not mandatory i mean it would be good that it was mandatory if you put your phone number on that list they can't call you
but it's not it's just a list for companies that don't want to bother with calling people
who have already said they don't want to be called because it's a waste of time and money
but yes there are other companies that don't care and try anyways just in case
they're the ones that don't look at the list and they call you and waste your time anyways
and they lose money
from spain
uh
i know yes
i don't get any i'm lucky my phone was new
and i put it just on january i put it on the list and the calls i have received are services of of the companies with which i already have services from
they want to sell me even more services
and that's very annoying too
but next time and they have called me from the same bank
i have been called many times for the same reason next time i´m going to tell them to please put me on their bank list
of not to call
i think they should have a list like that because me their client whatever
in new york
if a client of them tells them not to call anymore well dumb of them if they continue to call because the client could get mad and go away
so i´m going to try it and see if they stop from calling me from the bank because they always want to sell me the same and i have said not why do they want to sell me it again
if they think i´m going to say yes because of their insistence i don´t understand it
hello
yes
there is still i think the same i like some and some i don't that way each time it arrives in the mail three arrive
again in order to refinance my house i say no these people don't leave anyone alone
yes
yes that is true too true
mhm i always check them
yes because there are some like one can find something good if you look but on the telephone i don't like this
yes
and sometimes they call me early and of course they can't call you after 8 they call me before 8 but i don't answer
yes i have noticed
is tammy
if i pay attention to the caller id depending if i don't know who it is then i hope the voice machine picks up if i recognize the voice then i pick up
sometimes yes sometimes if i grab the phone and say oh i know who it is and say no thank you no thank you oh sometimes i pretend i don't speak english
so that they leave me alone i don't speak english there
in english
no they have not called me in spanish only in english
yes over here no over here it has not started yet well that is what i have to say
no over here there s quite a few
there has to be because if here if there is quite a few what strikes me that there is quite a few mexicans over here
there is not a lot there is panamanian but i don't know many and
no no nob co they have not called me to nobody to me as far as i know other people i don't know but they have not called e
alex again how are you
there is if
i got in in my email and i had ninety seven
yeah
yes its true
too many is because they send you so many things that you do not ask formy husband was laughing yesterday he got an email from a nudist beach for nudist and i was laughing
he was mad said from where from where they think i am from and i was laughing
had caused laughter because i had all cards in my hand but the one they send him that if you see the outside don't know does not say what it is
he had in the in the jacket for no one to seei say who can see you who is going to see your stuff i did laugh
youwhy they always send that i sayi don't know don't know
yeah
i don't think there are a lot of people that do this survey
ah
that is goodyeah
but one must be careful what one get into
mmmm
aha
there is mmmm
i remember when i went to see my lawyer the girl who works in the office the secretary was crying and i told her not to cry anymore
one of these telemarketers has removed five hundred dollars from my account
first a hundred and fifty dollars and the lawyer with whom she worked was going to fight to help her with that
people does not think about that
because i've already talked to you like three or four times
i too when i buy things on the internet my husband and i have a bank account that we put money in that we only use towards the internet
so if we are going to spend sixty dollars that is what i would put on the card and use it
is that
exactly me too
i heard something about that in the news that they had caught someone from the government of a city a a city in africa
they were mm
aha
yes i
ah yes that people i didn't buy that stuff of giving them my bank account no no no no they've called me from canada they say they want me to buy
lottery tickets
and another person two or three i know no i think so after we talk about what they say i think so
in canada and i say what for i say if i don't buy lottery tickets in here i do it rarely why would i want to buy tickets from the canada lottery
no that's a no and they say you are going to be rich no no thanks
ah yes a card they sent my husband a card my son's girlfriend that said she had won some earrings
diamond earrings a clock and some money and she had to send them around two hundred and fifty dollars so that she could get the prize
and she tells me because she's only eighteen years old i tell her don't go crazy telling what to do
hmm
yes
hmm
aham yes
yes
eh is not our fault that they don't have enough people that got into that survey
yes because every person there's people like this that's easy for them to get into things like this when they say there's something free i tell you when it's free
hmm my husband always tells me when it's something like that to read everything the the small words down there read it good good because they can take something from you that you have to pay something
but it's hard after you pay to get something from you
hmm so we have to i always tell that to my sister and sons
read everything yes i have not received anything in spanish yet
i tell you people never thinks about that i am a latin woman when they see me so i play it also so to with that that now you have this that
that you can call that they take away your phone that they take away that marketing that is also good
yes but i do not know i do not know i probably can ask my husband since he knows because he says it is free of charge you type your phone number and your name and they take you out of it
from the list they have because there are some that you tell them and they continue to call
because
is funny
because they buy the names the list of names
and sometimes they go like one time they told me that they go like this with each number from one two three four fine not them they do not know my phone number but
they go exactly almost one two three four five the numbers like this they dial them directly like this
so it is easy for them not to lose any becayse they are doing that at the order
mhm
and today i almost did it early and i couldn't so i say i'm going to call later and i forget and suddenly
hello
i always call at nine sharp and is nine sharp
good that you think of telemarketing
sometimes good offers
i like the marketing more by mail because it's not as how do i say it's more private and one can see the offer without the pressure of the
of the call
and sometimes there are good offers i don't approve everything i receive
i look at the things sometimes
good everything in life is a risk i think that there are not many things that are a risk everything is a risk sometimes you are going to win and sometimes you are going to lose true
the problem is when they are molesting you at an inopportune hour or when they are taking advantage of someone
yes it doesn't really matter to me i usually don't answer the calls
yes
yes i know that it's telemarketing
yes
and they call you you in english or spanish
never in spanish
and in and because here here like there is a lot of hispanic people in los angeles sometimes they call in spanish
well i think that you are the only person that speaks spanish in seattle
according to the fisher survey
yes
but they don't do marketing in spanish
and the other thing that bothers me sometimes there is there is a lot of spam from marketing on the computer
alex
there is quite a lot of that that should be more controlled by law
sometimes i have a special email to filter
and then i have my email only telemarketing
and i have to throw them have to take about ten or fifteen minutes to throw away when i could be doing something more important
yes wow
that is incredible
but sometimes there is good stuff about a year ago i got for a thing to go a show around here close
and i won some tickets to las vegas and disneyland tickets
and i did not spend a thing
there there are times when good things come from marketing
fine
one must be careful especially with computer and credit cards because many times it is trapped
i have a friend who was misled in marketing
the bank removed money from my account because they thought i gave out the number
and they charged me two hundred dollars to apply for the card
yes because
that happens quite often you should never give your financial information to telemarketing party
because they are going to steal and it's legal
and you know another thing it has left me
eh i have received letters from these ah foreign companies that want me to send money to the united states
and they want a bank account so that they can make the transfer i think it's a trap because they are not going to give you anything they are planning to steal the money that you have in the bank
i don't think there are many people no
yes from africa
and great britain too i once investigated a company that was offering me an offer through which i was supposed to get a lot of money
and it turned out that that company didn't exist
they wanted to take my money
mhm
yes
yes they always say that
yes
and and also many times it has happened that i've won things on the computer
but i have to do the survey and at the arv survey i have to buy something
well they are going to pay us
and i already know it's a scam because one gives his name address and phone
and then they want more they want you to buy something
then i never do and i've never received anything i've never received something it's like some marketing
there should be laws about something like that
free or or they've won something
i think that's called an enganghe in spanish
and and i am tired of this happening in spanish also
it is going to arrive these days
yes that is good
and i believe that they are going to keep calling because they say they make the calls randomly then they are not but they since they know your name also if they are doing it randomly
yes
how are the going to know your name
mhm
yes
then i do not believe we agree the best marketing is regular mail marketing
or newspapers
yes all the same
i'm always here at this time
good night this is milred from connecticut
well i vote for my own party but sometimes when i like a candidate from the other party i vote for them
hos is it said i don't know i am not a fan of the party am i an idealist of the party i'm
when i see that a candidate will do something good for the community or for the state well i vote for him even though it's for someone else
and i vote for the other candidates who are of my party but no i mean no i don't mean to how do you say
yeah yeah
yes i think that they are a little more more conservative in certain aspects but in some other things well sometimes they lose control
yeah that is why i think they don't maintain the power much because it's like they get afraid after things come like they
get friend and they pull back or stay
but the fact of being conservative indicates that you know they maintain the margin of certain things that they don't want to happen because they tight up a lot to
the matter of ethics and matter of politics you know they go through a lot i think the concepts the democrats well what they see goes through
how are you
even even though the people are all over him well they go right away you know they do it even though the whole world are all over him when not they don't want what they have
been putting but really well i don't know in my in my country at least the democrats have had control for like twenty eight years
and after those twentyeight years that the leader died that he was the strongest leader of that party well then it has been you know a couple years they vote for democrats
others the next other four vote republican and the democrats return again and they come and put the republicans dependent like they depend of how they see the situation in the country if they see that the country in those five years he has not done anything well they take him out quick
ha ha
yes i think that if a candidate um if a party has a candidate a good one and um because look this mane that governed puerto rico that was luis munoz marin
he governed it for twenty eight years he did good things you know he made the country progress he made the country well the truth is the country when it was behind he made it go forward
so well he maintained its control the control from everyone and then he died and lots of generations that stayed that followed him
even though he was dead he was still a leader to be honest they didn't see that it wasn't what he did they saw that because since they were
a popular party that was democracy that was was leaving how do you say hes leader it wasn't to be honest because they saw they weren't doing anything good
yes
i don't think it should be that way you know i think that if a candidate well you see can do better give him the opportunity
don't finish you think
ha ha
yes for a face for a face and a
for a few gestures but
well but ah always every politician promised i will do this i will i will i will and when the win the position they forgot of what they have to do
or or maybe they don't forget maybe they find so much so much oposicion because specially when a team wins like the democrats and
and casi the whole comrade are win by republicans well then it so much difficul to complete what was promised well no everyone of the republicans are going to approve new laws neither they are going to approve thing that he decide to do understand
and they are the majority and the ones going to vote a a voting and to count the decision well many times i see that it can be very difficult
to a lider that that is good but that won't win the rest of his team well it is very difficult you know eh the emem
and why can't you vote aren't you registered or you don't want to be registered
put everything that he can do on favor of of the community
because then the others won't give him an opportunity
i believe that depends of of you know yes yes let suppose if win the democrat and almost all of them are democrats
but when a democrat wins and all the rest are republicans they make their lives dif
but they are some that work for their own benefits truely the community
yeah yeah yes it is lots of bureaucracy i
it goes this way then starts the fights and problems and
yaeh that is why i tell you that when when they are not the same party always they bring many problems then some want one thing and others another
so no one never knows what they are going to indeed in me i in politic well i tell you coi envolved like how
after i got here been like like four years ago that i started to participate to take more action in the because i saw that they did not want to approve many things for the hispanics and
oh okay
that they were not treating to wellso i got involved in politics to helpbut also there is a lot of tell me and be told and they take you out they look for even the skin you have to take out all you have you know
all that want to look to find you if you run to to any porition forget it that they investigate your family and they take that if you sell this if you had this that if your son did that that if your aunt is was that
so i like that well i said no i can not be in this shot
so i keep working and i help them but no i did not get involved you know to run for nothing that i have nothing to be embarrassed but since i do not like the those
and especially i find that whites here try to manipulate and control a lot
especially in the republic party the democrat is a little more they have a little more of
of of that for the hispanics but the republicans are like racist they are more of for them
but doesn't residents vote i thought so
yes i always vote
i had a time when i thought i won't vote why but then a get involved working with one of the parties then i realized that we need to vote specially for hispanics
to raise our voices and our vote is there counting
oh good night this is mercedes from philadelphia
only with the line of the pol of the party
ah ya ya ya ah and of say of what the people say well what the people the conception that the democrats are more liberal and that the republicans are more
conservative what do you think of the conservatives what do you think about that
yes
yes what i think too is that eh maybe ah it's not much to stay in the middle right it's that
they are in one side well they are like very extremist but they have it in the extreme i think that is why
mhm
it's like that here it's like that and it's like that here too but sometimes that that is in my country i say too but sometimes its not much eh i would like for them to realize that sometimes it's matter of the person not so much the party
true or something else i don't know because hes on the other side
mhm
nice to meet you well we have to talk about politics
mhm
but sometimes um what i wanted to say aswell is that people that's with a lot of parties right
um and that um
yeah i mean that he doesnt maybe the candidate right but since they vote for the party they is what they make me mm i don't think its good but at the same time
uh there's people that do good just without classifications uh or the capacity of the candidate but with the way he is
that happens a lot in my country that's right people leave they fall in love like they say
uh uh and for what for i don't know for the impression thaty you've given that person uh
your resume or your curriculum right if of what you can do or you can not do
mhm
mhm
what do e think about it this is kind of a hard topic because well i have been living here for 6 years but i have never been interested in politics i can't vote so
mhm
yes
and and that is something that i think is counterproductive right because one think that when everything is done one would like maybe a ideal world that one with power everyone will work for the good of everyone
right right and that is the reason let's say for example here it is divided said when the pass the laws right first the congress then the senat and the the president right
but usually a lots of laws come but iniciative from the president right but the senate have to approve them and if the senate is
a team with the majority to the opposite team it is a great problem meaning is good i think so because is good ah em
had some control right equality between teams right but at the same time like lower the speed that the things and maybe like like more burocrats is why i am trying to say
yes
and something else also one of which i have read about something they do here in the united states for example i would say they are lots of laws a as if it's a presidential initiative right
but usually they do as a group right of eh of incentatives in only one document for example right like the they present one time
because i'm not still a citizen
to the to the senatefor example one day and like addendums or added right at the law that there is another law another law maybe the people do not support those other but they support the principal one
but like those were attached to those do not pass then they say nono we do not pass because that that right and maybe the main idea it was were all agreed upon but now
they have to start again as new
mhm
mhm mhm
mhm mhm
mhm
yes
yes yes that yes ai that in that i agree yes that maybe because the same they are don't know
i'm only a resident then i can't vote so
no we don't vote you have to be a citizen for voting do you vote have you ever vote
oh
and what do you think about democrats and republicans and their differeces
mmm
hello
yes yes yes yes very good
yes yes sometimes they stay with the most superficial a little no and you start well
um um
um um um
yes yes yes
yes he had some pedantic air didn't he sometimes being too smart
and maybe this i saw him a couple of times he came to philadelphia for a couple of meetings
and to me his messagehe said smart things but he didn't reach the people he didn't quite
have enough charisma
um yes
ye yes
well here i'm surprised about the fact it only exist to big parties that people only have two options because well in spain is really
um right on the other side it's not like he appears to be like one more another folk i am just like you
yes that's the role it plays that in fact is not because well his family is well he has a lot of money and it's an start i mean
that he is not one of us but he is
yes
yes yes yes
mmmm
but is the exact opposite
mmm
yes yes
of course of course
well a little chaotic because there is
mmm and what do you think about hillary clinton as a candidate
yes
there are many more options then
you have really conservative parties center ecologist liberals then
for example i'm from barcelona so there are more catalan parties less tan i don't know so
options more or less big we have almost 6 if you count smaller parties we have like 20
but with representation in the parliament there are six parties then
here instead i'm surprised it's black and white
and
i am laia from philadelphia
yes that's the problem because if they were
exactly exactly yes yes yes yes that sometimes they are not so different and you can you can feel a bit without representation no almost
um um um um
sure
um um um um
um um um um
um um um um um um um um sure
um um
what what's his name
oh ok yes yes yes that was a man um
good and you
yes um
um um um um um um
yes no he was a multimillionaire yes
yes yes and well even if i don't know there wasn't in the end there was
nader or is it naser or something ral ralph um
sure voting for him is like throwing your vote to the trash because you know he's not going to win
um yes yes yes
yes um um um um
uh uh
sure sure
very good
sure the what happens in spain is that ah you vote i don't know you vote for a very small party
but then before the the same important results because you know with the alliance that occur since neither party has the majority it really results in a smaller party being very decisive and very important in saying who who commands this well has happened many times
well in the history well then it's not a question to say ah since it's a small party well there was no vote because it will not work a thing because it's
yes what can it really do but clearly in this system here really it is
one or the other right
yes yes yes yes
um
uhm uhm uhm uhm
clearly
clearly and it's far from breaking this dynamic and furthermore
good we need to talk about politics right
well with all the money that is necessary no to present yourself and the campaigns and
ah yes yes well i i remember about when bush won the first time really people got very surprised no firstly the voting system is so complicated no with the little holes and so and that
really there was so much not so much confusion in which
it may be well the biggest democracy and the most stable but i don't know what
but
exactly exactly exactly
yes yes yes
two thousand
yes
yes it was it was very strange true that true that
as
uhm uhm
yes
now i was very surprise that al gore don't push more not protested a little more because everything was so weird so dark that
that i don't know i was surprised that he retired so soon that i dont know well i dont understand that
oh well
hmm yes and i supose that the things had been more different no if
but well yes
yes yes
mmm
and nothing the last ones too it was sad well i don't know i felt very sad because i thought that really it would have been a change no and the people
yes
it would do
um um um um
um um um um um um um um yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes or rather the second time is indisputable or rather um
um
uh uh yes yes
because you can vote here
you you vote or rather you you are american citizen i mean
of course um um um um okay okay okay
um um um
yes yes we talked ah very good uh uh uh
um
um um um
ofcourse
ofcourse yes yes yes
um um um um um ofcourse ofcourse yes yes yes at the very least one good thing you have is that there is only two mandates per president no well at least the next time well he is worse than bush but well i doubt it no
yes there that this is good because in spain no no there is no limit
and i don't know if it perpetuates during years and years and years
and well it is good that there is change of
ofcourse no even though eight even though eight yes there has been plenty yes yes yes
yes is it known who will be the democratic candidate
i am a student in the pennsylvania college here in philadelphia
yes yes yes
in 2000 in the eight
hm hm um um
but i don't believe that kerry will run again right
that is
hm hm
hm
hm hm hm hm
clearly ok
hm hm hm hm hm hm
hello
yeah yeah i remember good let's talk about politics
so one needs to have a message like that simple
sure people believe what they hear but they only believe the simple and clear things
people don't want to listen to many explanations too complicated things they get lost
you have to say things in a very direct way in a way that can be understood without many doubts
and i think that maybe kerry was too intelligent
um um
um
um
yes and gore was even worsegore was so intellectual
that people couldn't listen to him
what do you think as a foreign student here about local politics
they didn't understand him they felt him so distant
of course like a neighbor the man lives in the same block as me
of course
of course i think that he is also real smart
and i think that he acts really stupid
to convince people that he is not dangerous
like he is like that
i think he is smart if he is not smart at least the people in his government are smart
because they have done a lot of things and it is not a coincidence i mean
it haven't being through all these things without a plan
um
so
ah i like ah ah i like but i think it will be difficult
mmm
well
mmmm
i see
oh well
i see okay
sure
hi em so nicole i speak of new york
sure and sometimes they are not so different from each other
gray and gray bad and worse
yes um yes yes there are small parties that really have a very different perspective than the rest but they don't have
they don't have enough support
and they don't have enough money
em so that there really are two parties
i mean when one i mean always in elections em when you're going to vote here em they show the parties including the small ones em eh when you vote but the other ones it's such a minimal percentage
only once in the presidential elections there was a a a a man that represented represented like an independent party
it's eh ross perot eh
perot perot
hi how are you
that was a few years ago and all the same he i mean he won many many votes but
it's not enough to win but
i don't know he was a very very rich man
and sure he could be and idealist with another perspective you typically can't
you can't
um ah yes nader nader yes he's also
sure sure he's not a i mean he's like a symbolic candidate
you can't really vote for him because he won't win one knows that he knows that too
he has lots of ideas very good ones in my opinion but
i wouldn't vote for him just because i really care about who
good
who's really got a chance of winning the presidency
um
clearly uhm
clearly
no it's always republicans and democrats always
or so
and and historically it's been like that well many years ago there were other parties but
but for the least part the past hundred years
have been lik that
uhm
um
uhm yes and what do the people think in in spain or what do you think of of the things that have happened here with the elections
so close and and counting the the the votes all that mess
uhm uhm yes
um
sure sure is like the one
because in this country we the people rule for other countries to keep watching the election to keep it legal
and at the same time our own election is such a complicated matter and so difficult to understand
and really finally i don't know this election in the year
i mean that was in the two thousand year
that election the thing was like at the end like almost a paid thing or something by
in politics we talked before or not
through connections because bush bush's brother eh it was him
the governor of florida like everything occur
like it was ocurring in other place
mmm yes
mmm
yes i also saw that how he is going to say now
mmm
yes it had another history by now i mean
you´ll imagine five years later
everything that have occur
i think we talked about it earlier
mmm i too i too the last time was really
the first time i felt much much much anger i like like people really
most voted for gore and still placed bush you felt anger the second time i felt sadness
because people voted for bush
like that were going like they were going to vote for him again after everything that had happened
i thought what country is this or rather who were voting
i don't know i don't know
of course well i voted but
yes yes yes yes i am a citizen or rather i was born here
for this reason but i don't know the system really needs to change i believe
yes are you from spain
because well well the government also has to change but the voting system is very
it is very unjust because they go by state
it shouldn't be like that it should be the majority wins
point
well why go by state that gives the small states a lot of power
um um
um
ofcourse
ofcourse yes yes yes i agree with that because every eight years there is eight years well it is plenty of time
we'll see what happens the next time i don't know
ah yes we discussed it earlier um beyond being a college student right
no not yet it is to early to tell because that
it will occur in the year 2000
eight that is the campaign will start with 2007 two more years
ah but until now no no one knows
no
no kerry really wasn't a strong candidate
really what the democrats need is someone more charismatic with more personality
with a really clear message for the people
you see i don't know how it was before but these days a politician needs to have a clear message for the people because the people
get confused easily as if they don't put enough attention they're not that interested
my name is david hello wendy
oh a little bit not a lot the thing is i have not talked with a lot of people that's for sure
to help to you know to find direction in your in your life you know
and and they only want to help those that that give donations that help here they want um food they want time
uh you know it takes up a lot of time of one's life
you know um also
um
we all are
yes
because of that it is because they are flyers of of the time before so that's how they that's how they were brought up the time before the old timers
yes the church was much every sunday we had to go the church you know and and what happens in in those years
no no the the
why why
when you're growing up you lose your interest in church
and then then one one isn't passing these same upbringings for your kids
and hmm mm
the service
yeah uh i didn't talk to a lot of people because of the survey
yeah
really
oh
oh okay
oh so you're in arizona hows the climate there
oh yeah
oh are you on the cellphone or at home
oh how are you
oh in your car
oh oh
what happened
oh this is about religion yea i have spent three days talking about the same story they don't change it
no they don't change the theme
right
oh no in those days in those no they already have like 4 or 5 days where the topic is that same of religion
yeah and
yea but oh the people the become brave
it's a bad topic
in arizona here in connecticut
and yes
no no people that i've spoken to they come one comes from la
right
right yeah
yeah no
yeah it's very controversial because people get
let me tell you they get really angry that it's this that not that the
good good and that no
yes because
well for for for me it's that people i mean everyone in the world they believe in their in their religion no but there are different people
yea do you think i've talked to you before
there are different persons um different parts of the world like the chinese and the the the the muslims the buddhists and the catholics the
there are different you know because they don't have the same upbringings
then right so then who who is one to say that the the religion of one is better than the other
fine but but it makes people very angry you're attacking you're attacking their religion you know
it's ooh
it's topic to talk about let me tell you
because also i am catholic but you know i'm i i since i was very small i was um my mother always took me to church but now for for eighteen years now of that is i got married and i was married in in the catholic church
and and and everything but for me it's you know are with so many problems that it had the the the hard
in the catholic church you know that is
with so much money that one gives it so much money that's hard you know everyone works hard for their money
i think that i i talked to you last week
so for that is of course in the in the for for a donation for the church so that the church helps the other people the poor people
and it's helping one one to the others they help themselves because all the money that they're giving the families so that they keep quiet
you know that money you know
and there were millions millions of dollars
no
yea i mean up here where we are up above in how i li i am i live near massachusetts
and and all the problems were in in the church of massachusetts the church of florida the church of new york there were lots of um priests
that were in involved with young men
and and and well for like thirty years they knew ththe church knew about about the oh priest had problems and yes they had a problem
they paid the family so they could stay quiet you know and
yes your voice sounds familiar
yea and all that money came out from the collection fee all the money came out of the church and they were millions and millions of dollars
two hundred thousand a hundred thousand
you know
it depends i mean
um including the the the people that go to church
no
i'm sorry of their income i see but
yeah you tides you do your your tides but the the
yes yes they do that and they verify it it's like wcw two let me see your your your your your your your paycheck
you know you make yeah otherwise you aren't allowed to go to church
yes yes you are from texas right
yeah yes
but it's the same thing i know the church that is here but the church where i was it's big now people that go there
they have priests and you know i mean everybody has an envelop with their names on it and it's like you only gave twenty dollars this week
you have to give thirtytwo dollars no you earn six hundred fifty dollars minus taxes
you have to give to the to the church thirty and that so much you know and them they wait they expect it
yes
hm
hm mm
yes what you place um um yeah

ah yeah ah but i was going to ask how old are you
twenty six okay they you are still young we have i am forty years old
and we we went to school before it was very differenti mean um the church was more more no no they didn't ask too much it was more for you know
um more
more yeah you know you went to to go to church because you want
you know so you prayed more and and it was more for the individual than for the church
so these days it's more for the church than for the individual
you know uh this is key you want to go to church so that you could help the church
you know instead of staying in business rather than the other rather than helping and everybody goes back you know but uh sincerely
the church is for the youth or you know for the individual
