there is the same little problem also
but it happens that am at home we go to church
eh well we talk and all and we got to the conclusion
that in that aspect women are beautiful no and they have to dress up because they are not going to go like that all the time
exactly then in that sense
yes there are there are people who get bother a lot then they look to the other as less than other people
and they look at you like you are weird but i don't pay attention because and more my sisters i have two sisters
and then dress up very beautiful and they are young they dress up beautifully
ah i see
so no yes but there are people who do get bothered a lot
some times they don't greet anyone
or but no but yes they have their manner of thinking and they are sometimes like very stubborn
so why not it's not it is as i say
but fine one must
yes
uh huh
uh huh
hmm
yes
i'm from columbia yes
yes yes
yes
sure you have groom yourself to attend you have to look good as if you were going to a party really
it has nothing to do with god nothing like that ah when you go to church you have to look nice
all dolled up
exact exactly
exactly yes
yes
yes
weird and
ah yes it's religion
i was going to say were you sir born in puerto rico
mhm mhm
yes wow and the
aha he got married here
wow yes
oh you are young my mother has twe eh
she's going to be fifty years old in this november
yes and i'm going to be twentyseven years old
in november too yes then those are the things that one thinks about when he's coming for example in the united states
as trying to seek something a better future for one's kids no
afternoon
uhhuh
aha aha
aha aha yes yes yes
uh um
right
oh that's good that's good
right
right right right but no in in our countries it's not the same than here
there's a lot of poverty and not so much work
and here there isn't you can get a job anywhere
but but family since my family stayed there in puerto rico i have my mom there my brothers
carmen
my nephews and every now and then i go to see them
but but i'm not going to live there in puerto rico because i have my two children here
though they are older already but they still live with me
until they get married and each of them has a job and their and their and they go live with their wives and their husbands
eh no it can not i can not go there to puerto rico without worrying
in puerto rico yes yes
ah
no i came to live i went to florida with my mother and my young siblings
and from floria i came here to chicago with my mom and my young siblings too
then my mom moved to puerto rico
this is the first time we talk no
and my young siblings went to puerto rico then i stayed here and since i got married i stayed here
but my mom was coming and going but my mom doesn't like it here because of the cold
but no and she says that it's better that she is here placed in four corners and in puerto rico she can be leaving and entering the house
it's not the same
en puerto rico
but my mom is catholic and my aunt is catholic
mi uncle is christian he goes and reads the bible and my mom
and he talks a lot of father god and he asks my mom questions about god and my mom responds
but he doesn't like it because my mom after my grandfather died my mom took out her eyebrows
made holes in her ear to put on earrings
ok
she shaved her legs put on pants put on dresses
and my grandfather and my papa and my uncle they didn't like
because he says that women should not use pants
because of their religion in his religion
of my mother
he says that that woman should not use pants because the pants were made for men
but my uncle is very very very how is it religion fanatic
he has a religion very at heart like he
but one thing yes he does not tell his children to get in the religion
only to to my mother and his sisters his nieces his newphes but his own children does not say anything
in chicago
so then am that's why oh i say to him that that he to believe in god you do not have to be seven days a week in church
but he is seven days a week in church
he is saturday he says he's going to the church from the early morning
until the night and all day sunday in church
so he's really fanatic about the church
i have a friend she's christian and she only she says she goes to the church
saturday and sunday
but my uncle goes seven days a week
and he's always talking about god god over here god over there
i i always when i go to puerto rico i tell him
twenty nine years
god he's buy our side twenty four hours a day
i tell him you don't have to go to church to talk to god because even in your own bed you can talk with god
it's unique that that one can't continue asking father god alone how is it we only remember father god when we have problems and not all of the time
but there are some people that
ay my god that grants me to be ay my god that es but when we are good that we don't have problems
well i don't believe that father god exists
aha and you
aha
ok ok
oh
my name is carmen in chicago you
aha
ok
th yes i have my my husband and my two grown up kids here in chicago
aha not you
oh
aha
aha
and what is your religion
oh ok i'm catholic
aha
of
aha aha
aha
and what do you believe about about your religion what do you believe
aha
aha
aha
mmh
aha aha
aha aha aha
aha
okay good afternoon
aha
but aha continue
well i think well i am catholic
i i believe in god a lot but no i don't practice the to go to the to the to church every day every day every day
because i was taught since i was little my dad
no he made us he made us kneel around the bed
and there all am my dad my mom and all my siblings and my siblings
we asked father god for us for all our family
and my dad always taught us that that for you to be to believe in god you don't have to be involved with a church
ah but i have an uncle who is a christian
good thank god and you
but he is he is in puerto rico
but often when i go to puerto rico he wants me to change religion to their orthodoxy because they say that orthodoxy
it's a um it's a religion that how is it that you can in other words that women can wear pants with fans that reveal the skin
that they paint
well he says that this isn't good
that well that we catholics are really liberal not like the christians that put their
in other words the woman puts on her suit or her skirt and bouse
and long skirt not cut off and not screened and not painted
well but my uncle is religious
and i don't believe that
yes it's very cold
that the same god that the same god that he worships is the same one that we also worship
aha
aha
aha
aha
aha
aha aha natural aha aha aha aha
aha
aha aha aha aha
aha
i'm from puerto rico
aha aha aha
uh huh
hmm
uh huh
hmmm
but also in the schoo in the catholic church aslo i remember when my children were small
for i took them to the church
and we were waiting what came out it it it the first the first turn that him that him touched the people that american
we were waiting and behind me there was a hispanic lady
that was speaking about if the lady would be leaving if she believed that she was going to a party and if her clothing would be very
and you
very colorful to go to a church and her shoes were very high that is she was so fixed up it seemed that
that she was going to to a party that didn't seem to be in a church
and i looked at her and said
how would she be talking of that if she loves god
aha aha
aha aha aha aha aha
but it's not to so that you use that to gossip about the others if you are going to church
you are not supposed to gossip about other people
but she was like i looked to here and said wow my god if she talks like this here how does she
talks if she sees a woman in the street showing her body
oh do you know the topic today
ah
aha
yes i was born in puerto rico and i grew up there
and i got here in the united states when i was about eighteen or nineteen years old aha
and i got married
yes and i have a twentyeight year old daughter and a twentysix year old boy
and i'm almost fifty years old
yes
oh yes
oh almost as old as my son
hi milgred from connecticut
adventists or they are um or evangelical
or they are from this others the ones of the taballas the ones who sells uh oh what's their name the l i forgot their name
but they are i mean they are a lot there are a lot of races and religions
but um to me i don't get bothered with other religions i share with any other religion as long as they don't try to to put me in in something i don't want do you follow me
right not being fanatics right
yeah
yeah religion is like politics
that depending of of what point you look at it well not the whole world will be in agreement follow me
hm mm yea but it's good it's good that they discuss everything because if you look at it i have aunts and cousins who belong the evangelic religion
and the rest of them are catholics
how are you good night
and in the in the other side of my family there are some who are absenteeism
but when we reunite no one is talking of religion an no one is talking about you know that you have to be this way and you have to change nothing
and my cousin's husband is an evangelical you will almost always find him in the church and she does not belong to the church and they have a happier marriage than most
and she she only there on special occasions mostly for ceremonies for mother's when she is involved
but they celebrate that because they do not celebrate christmas but there are also other times
the evangelicals
aha yes the evangelicals so my cousin's husband says that he was not married by that religion but they did get married at the church
and she dances and she drinks and he accompanied her to work and to the party where there was a present
you haven't told anybody ah you still have to stop smoking and you have to quit drinking protein
if you make jokes of you at the party rather than getting cranky you know that this is not a big deal so you should just have a good time
hm
yes you can get a person like that it all depends on the person but if they become fans forget about it
that is
aha
aha that is like my cousin as well
oh really
uh huh
uh huh
that is you're not going to church or anything
no
i am going to the church but no i'm not with that which they call a pious woman stuck there all the the church no
do you believe that join or disjoints or
you don't like it
uh huh
uh huh
o yes yes i think that it's a very important base especially for the children
but yes one raises them at least with with something forget that they leave and and are what do i know they they become half wild half
they don't have like feelings i mean the don't create a relationship with feelings towards anything
you get me it's like they don't care about anything
and and and you were from you say that you're a christian and that and what a miracle that eh they accepted you in his family seeing that that jews almost always
they are how do you say it are
only among themselves that they tr they try to marry and so they have the same religion
or do you believe that if everybody were the same religion we will be better or be equal or it will be
aha ah
but did you get marries by the jewish or did you get married by the catholics
oh how nice ah yes aha
hm mm
and what did they say aha
the my youngest girl the one that is bigger are are they got baptized and are catholic but the youngest though she was baptized in the catholic church she also visits the church
the evangelical church
she goes with my cousin's husband and you know when she goes she wears her long skit aha yes you know like she respects her her
their religion of theirs and eh she she likes going with them and and i never told her no when they asked me if they could take her and i ah yes
you know
thw world will be better
ah because eh eh i think that the bible says that pants are worn my men something like that eh
it is related with that
hm those are the ones who become fanatic that
they interpret word for word to the to what is written you understand
it is like the the the those the the iraqis those with their doctrine that of of craziness who kill people in the name of of
the god they had or what they believe
sometimes there is people with their minds distorted
interpreting things that should be unifying because religion must unify no matter which one do you understand i don't think that only because two humans are from different religions they
must kill each other because of that belief
for me as a non fan of anything i don't become a fan of anything i was raised in the catholic religion
yeah yeah
i helped at church i belonged to the mary's daughter club i helped a lo at church
it has always been my faith the catholic church i took my children to church and i baptized them because that's how i was raised
but know as grown ups if they want't to go somewhere you must understand you cant make them not to go some church
you can't believe in that because the catholic church says it's different you know
and the great amount of evangelic or jehovah's witnesses people try to force things up to your brain they want to come to your home early and start to sell whatever they have
and well sometimes they knock and i thank them and say i have your book and if they insist i say hey i'm catholic and don't
they are no prudent
yes
i had a lady that came look every time i was out from the door she came like no look it's for you to help us with this buy the book you know that
you're in sin what do i know but i've been a sinner since i was born my dear so let the lord punish me when i get up ther so
yeah yes i believe it is it's the same and as not having all we aren't the same race so the each race has it's own
well if they try to i don't know they go and say such negative things instead of saying well look you can know the lord better and what do i know
everywhere but that about being a sinner yes yes i keep sinning and you're sinning right now talking like that
it's doctrine own or and and although we are hispanic some of us adquire another that in eh sometimes aren't neither i mean sometimes some of us are a catholic family and others in the family are
hi
hmm mm
exactly not including you
they oppose it don't feel forced right
talking to you okay i mean i think that it's that eh what is it called um the that the religion is separated because of difference
well in which one believes the the differences always exist
exactly
hm mm that is why they say that one should never discuss religion not because for that i can't believe they put us to discuss religion in this show
hmm
hm mm
hm mm
it's mercedes from florida
who are they
okay
hm
this is what happened in my house
hey my mom is that religious
and my dad did not believe in church he never said why
but all of us went to catholic school
yes then how that n we had well of the always christians well but
eh we had eh or that is that which we learned in school we didn't reinforce at home
and now yes i think that my of my sisters only the oldest is catholic still my younger sister eh eh think that she's evangelical and i no i have decided that i do not have religion
mm good night too
mm no
uh huh no
hmm mm hmm mm not i since i was married of that i went out i went to the university and i left the university i already decided that i wasn't going to return to the
to a church no not me no the truth that interesting eh to me the the organized religion no no
no no exac not that i don't like it but no i don't feel the necess that is well i feel that god i keep him in my heart
and so it's like i live my life well eh but let's say and then now i married my husband he's jewish and my son is jewish too and we're going to bring him up jewish
because i do believe that one needs to gro eh to grow up with a religion
yes yes definitely i
hm mm
hm mm yes
let's see what we can talk about religion then
yes yes and that's why yes i agree that yes yes the it's that the if ne the kids do need well and that's why they say
yes yes they are really yes
yes we were lucky
yes yes it's it's true there are there are eh they of course of course they are very strict right
but no my husbands family have always been very understanding also the other son got married the girl she's not either eh
jewish and i think i imagine that maybe yeah i was the second one they didn't
no we had a religious an jewish ceremony
yes and let's say and then is what i'm saying my son is going to be raised and i say it's important that he's raised with a religion
when he is already an adult then he will decide what he wants to do
true if i want to go or if he wants i don't know stop being be another thing whatever but i do believe that whatever religion it is a child must be raised with the defined religion
hm
hm mm
i don't understand that because let's say my mom eh you see that she when she says that she goes to the church she goes she has to wear a skirt
then i tell her but why is it bad to wear pants
yes but but to me that and that to me that was one of the em
reasons really of of eh not get away but from a little of what organized religion is any organized religion that there are people who when it comes to the bible too strict well they take it
eh yes
hm mm
mmm
mmm
yes
mm i believe that i what i believe is that that
mmm
and there exist so many kind of people i understand them
their work is to transf well not heir work but they want to transform people into their religion but they don't respect
right oh it might be me but
somebody being the same religion that all we be the same religion it's imposible because i think that always are going to be diferences eh cultural
and that always is going to make that each person interprets that unique religion at it's own way
hm mm
good night how are you with norma here from atlanta georgia where are you from
yes my husband is american yes aha
and so what do you think about religion about religions
aha
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
well i i am very religious i belong to a religion that is the hare krishna religion i don't know if you have heard of it
mhm yes it's based on a hindu philosophy
so first we believe that you are a part or a portion of god and we also believe in reincarnation we have rules and regulations we're vegetarian we don't eat meat eggs or fish
ah okay
mm we don't drink alcohol
because for us we believe that every life animal deserves respect we have to avoid violence
so that's why we don't eat meat we dont intoxicate ourselves with drugs or alcohol
we don't drink coffee or tea
and we don't play around
no and are you religious are you from any religion
mhm
mhm
but you believe in god
oh that's really nice sometimes you don't feel connected to a group of people
i am peruvian
but the important thing is to have god in your heart and to develop your relation with god that's really important
a supreme being
of course
mm yes
mmm
of course a supreme being which controls everything
the religion is well religions or the beliefs have a supreme being it helps people being closer in catastrophes and times of pain then you always
ask god for help everyone there are some people called atheist and they are always desperate
they don't ask they turn their faces like that from asking god to help them
it's not that it just it's in their heart right you just feel that there really is a supreme being that many times doesn't
ah okay yeah there are a lot of peruvians around here
uh um of course uh um
yes yes that's why you don't in our philosophy there's always a future a verse that says not that when you're suffering
one always one always asks god for help and one should really uh should ask god to send more suffering because that way you remember him more
because if not when you're ok you forget about your relationship with god
and that's true isn't it because when you do fine you're very happy
no then you think that you are in control not that he is that you are in control of everything that happens and that one does the work right
no but it's really that god blesses you and helps you in many circumstances
and do you have a do you have a notion about reincarnation or something like that have you heard something about karma have you read
uh um
mmm yes ok the karma law is the law of action and reaction that one person in agree of his positive or negative activities it has a reaction positive or negative
ah you are mexican
no for that we many times said but why there are so many things that happen to people no although you see very good people but really are
reactions of their past lives that we realize actions very negatives and now its from the negative reaction that they are suffering
no its not really that there aren't people that are very inocent or very good people its just a reaction like you have free will
not to do what we wish god doesn't force us to believe in him doesnt force us to serve or do devotional service for that
we have our free will and if we do negative activities many times there is a reaction of the karma law for that nobody its free of the karma law its infalible
mmm that's what we think it i mean what we believe no
yes in our religion
yes i mean now i am married i live here in apparment near to the temple we have
the temple here in georgia in atlanta but before a live in the temple i mean i was like an internal there i lived like i was doing service not krishna no to god
no there are many kinds of service that we do one is preach one sing the name saints of lord one kitchen for the lord we offer food to god
ah okay
and does many different activities no
not all you do like the center of your life is god no you offer him everything all your deeds your meals everything you do and when you wake up in the morning you go to the altar and pray
and offer him our food so now i'm married and i have kids so i have to take care of them
but i do i always go to the temple and we are devout many people come on sundays or in big celebrations that we have during the year
mhm
well we have bhaktivedanta prabhupada ace bhaktivedanta prabhupada he is a devout of god he brought this knowledge to the west
no he's not we really don't honor him
well he respect jesus christ too it's because we respect other religions other beliefs
sure he brought that knowledge to the west about this ideas of krishna as we call it we name it after the city
mhm
mhm
mhm
is called international society for the conscience of krishna
ah his name is ace bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada
aha yes he he was born in india
well he is no longer in the planet no he already died and abandoned his body
no or rather he is devoted he is considered a pure devoted to god and he returned to the spiritual world
no no he will no longer reincarnate because he reached the goal in life in this world in this material world is where you develop your devotion to god
and to not get back to the spiritual world and from the spiritual word you can't can't come back to this material world to experience the cycle of birth sickness and death that all of living things go through
no even the animals and humans being
no
no i am i take care of my kid i am a housewife
nn yeah
yes he passed that level he is already a pure devoted
i don't know if it's very interesting it would be great if you not interested could
peruvian no no my husband isn't
hello
aha peruvian american
ah ok ah very good
well i think that from the times of like medieval and that
religion was lost during industrialization i mean what i want to say is that religion stopped being something spiritual
and became something more political and then lately now in the last times it has ceased to be so political but even so it still keeps bringing many of the ones that are
like the institutions so you can be very religious and spiritual
but not necessarily in favor of an institution and then maybe you don't necessarily have to be in favor of what the church says or in favor of what is said by
some certain institution like the jewish one the catholic one or the muslim one but then maybe if you can here among the topics mix a bit of of the philosophies of all of them like
rather use them to follow a good path of life more than anything
and what do you think
i am arthur i am in i am in pennsylvania philadelphia
ah yes yes yes i've heard about it never i don't know very well how they are what is the hare krishna about
aha
and why not why don't you eat meat why do you think that
oh okay
ha
yeah
no playing around games
and no no i don't belong to any institution for the moment i grew up catholic but now i'm bigger im twenty one years old
like at around eighteen i stopped following the institution because i didn't have much interest in it
and i felt that it was already in my spirit my contact with
yes pleasure to meet you where are you from norma
with not god i didn't have to go the institution to get that so i started to read other religions but more than anything
to get an interest and lets say practice life but
but yeah i'm not i don't like the institutions
yes definitively but
exactly
yes precisely knowing if it really is
a divinity behind everything
sometimes well related to that it has changed so much in fact i study chemical engineering and sometimes people think that in science you tend to
to brake religion to currupt it
but think it's re opposite because people who starts studying this well this scientific things are normally really religious because
peruvian a my my my roommate is peruvian
when they start knowing themselves of about things they can explain
more questions arrive and you understand that the world is not understandable there are miracle things all over the place and time
i feel that each time when people knows like scientist do and those people understands that there must be a supreme chaos and a divinity behind everything
yes
yes yes yes that's it
yeah exactly you don't turn to religion only to ask for help but also to thank
i think that many times people become religious at certain times because they need help but once they're ok they forget
yes
yes
yes you don't remember
from lima yeah right also mexicans
yes yes yes
yes yes yes true
well i have heard about karma right and how karma is is it's brought upon right i mean if you had bad karma you will reincarnate in another being but for
to improve it not just clean it no that you have another opportunity to do your karma something good more pure its not something like that
oh ok
yes
yes
yes
oh i see the hare krishna
and what do you do do you gather with the hare krishna every week or everyday
yeah i am mexican
ok
o yes
aha
sure
ah okay do you have something like a prophet like jesus christ how's that
aha
what's his name again
yes sure
ah okay
what's the name of the man again
from mexico city
what's his name
oh okay okay but what's the name of the man that brought you
okay is of hindu origin or where does he come from
oh okay
an okay but then or rather it is very possible that has reincarnated in someone else or he wont reincarnate because it has karma
oh okay so then he will no long reincarnate
yeah
yes exactly
okay of course
and so then then he has already passed that level and he no longer reincarnates
very good and in georgia what do you do study or work
okay
oh very interesting
and how long have you been in this religion
ah okay very good and the your husband is is from also from

we laugh a little and she tells me about her family
i don't know because i think that the other day i spoke to someone that lives in her house and they told me she was from an island
is not grenada but is an island from
from the caribbean that has a special language and something like that
yes but regardless she understands well yes if one
if you explain it well she understands look and this about the email have you bought with you haven't requested
haaa
no
ah
aha that you won this that you put like they arrive via msn i have msn
then that josefina was rewarded with this that press here you have a free scholarship and you have i don't know
and a trip uh and cruises and
and i delete them because those are to know
if you answer not for
mmh
ah
i tell you and how they find out so much about you no
two days two three days aha
such a weird people
wow
mhm mhm
to cover the expenses right
o but it is
oh but that is horrihorrible because i left it a bit controlled by the filter of downloading that that i do not know they installed there a spam filter
i asked for it i did not bought it but they installed it from msn no
i believe that filters a little but not always the junk where it says junk this appears like ten or twelve a day right
aha
so
oh my god
mhm
aha
ah
or it needs to bring like a file or attachment or something like this that says
if you want to open this e mail something like this you said
aha mine has i say to me they made it because when i send by yahoo because i have one mail one division
in yahoo and sometimes when im going to send an e mail it ask me one um to identify something that is decoded needs to be decoded no
says this is to protect
messages something like this
so then put the pieces together the the letters how they go
not specially
but sometimes is a p r j
tea and a number and something like that
you had seen it it is not like a crossword like a puzzle no
i don't know if that what is
to protect
ah yes
ohhh
that not filter
ah and how is in the in the forums had you thought in the forums like the univision or telemundo
and when you write a word like stupid or idit this won't be collect no or it will said we don't permit that type of vocabulary
of course and one week you told me you had an exam like friday or something like that
mm a little bit of each
hello good evening oh is jose
some math classes i'm taking and i also have um eh i'm taking a marketing class and i also have another another homework so
oh in a week yes i have a busy week but at least i have
all these two days yes free yes
me no yet many nights i am busy and i can not then
i only i have only twelve thirteen yes
ahh if it is because of that i want to speed up because i know that soon
some people are going to stop doing that
ahh
m
ahh
oh good good and you oh good here quiet there are no classes tomorrow so tomorrow and tuesday
ahh yes nearly everybody
knows somebody in the university or they study in the university because
but i don't know how you are going to know about that
ok yes of course of course
yes yes yes it doesn't matter
not this but but it seems to me that this program they have had several problems with the computers that or the or i don't know with with the gadgets really that call
that they record because it happened to me several or two times it happened to me that i was in the middle of the conversation and suddenly it cut out
mmm mmh yes shudong yes
yes
yes those
yes so i returned here to the house yes the fall break
yes shudong
yes shudong tells you just hang up but that is embarrassing but i don't know
ah
mm mm
ah
yes
but is she american or
mm
ah and not necessarily spanish
yes yes yes
holiday then yes here so i'm resting
no never never well what i have is that in my account because i have two accounts one is hotmail and another in
in the university and in the university they hardly ever send me
like that unsolicited mails but in hotmail it is terrible all all days i receive
twenty twentyfive messages and all trash but
mmh
ah
eh yes
yes
yes the the sad thing is that with but because what they do people who send all those emails is that they have they put ah they create programs
they go through the internet from website to website then when they find
yes no yes i also don't have class on friday
a an email address
they put it on a list and then yes
yes yes then and they also go to the news group and go to
to the all all all and then it is easy that or or for instance the directories or for instance the hotmail directory i think that there too
they look for names and look and then they create a huge list
and then with that list they make a message right and then they send it to everyone in the list but is that so the amount of work needed is so little so little right
and if two or three people answer from the thousands they already earned enough money for for whatever
yes yes that is sad that is that
with two or three fools they already already molested all of us right
mhm
well i have a class on friday but no
mm
yes it always happens that if i read an article that looked interesting to me that that microsoft what wants to do know is that it is making something like that a software that does that
am that that one time i sent a message to the computer that it has to make like a something i do not know that has to break a code or do some task so it is not
very very large
but it will be required like this a little of work really then if one is sending e mail write one e mail and i will send it noone will not even noticeright
and also when also when the computer do the task then break the code exactly then do that also in microsoft will give you a certificate to the e mail
that that the person took a little of time to make that right then if only one is sending 2 emails it does not matter then the e mail will arrive and will know that is not spam but if one is sending millions of e mails
one one do not have the computer don't have the strength like this the processor cant make a lot of work right
sending so many e mails then it will delay more and possibly what is waiting is going to delay so much that i believe it will be too much
slow and they wont be able to send all the e mails that is being sent now a day
is not is nothing in general i'm not going because there's a graduate student that helps you but seriously the class
at the moment when some one receive an e mail without the certificate one knows that is a spam it can be thrown away
yea yes i don't know exactly
no exactly what it is but i think is a good idea
mhm
mm
yes
yes yes
yeah
mhm
and the numbers yes
oh is during the week when there's a teacher but that's only if you need help right
yes i had seen them yes mhm mhm
yes i don't know don't know
but i think that the filters were not to efficient right because if you think that that each time that you put like you can say ah well if have a
a a what is the suspicious phrase you can send to the spam right but many times then
who believe in the spam they know which one are the the the phrases that that in general activate the filters right
then they believe the the message is the form that no
that won't pick up the filter yes yes then
ahhh yes once and a while
ay interesting
so yes yes friday i have an exam so i was studying and i also have i have several things this week friday i also have a homework for
hellw how are you
what do i think of unsolicited mail well that it's a mess
that i throw it in the trash immediately
when it arrives
it makes my nerves
yes yes
mm well and from and the email is a scandal the spam
which one do you use yahoo
oh gmail yes yes
mmh
mmh
ver well i am miguel angel and i'm in philadelphia and you
yes yes i have yes it is true i have yahoo and also and also spam it puts it in a different folder and
and if you don't want to read it don't do it don't don't read it if you don't want it
mm yes no that is true
oh no no
yes yes yes
mm yes i also the spanish i look i have been living in spain okay until the last week i only have one year here you know in the united states
and okay in spain it is the same i mean there is also too much spam i don't know no there doesn't matter the language so that is already international
bad things get to anywhere in no time ah
oh i have bought i've bought stuff in internet i mean i've bought books in amazon and i've bought tickets to concerts and all that kind of things but it has been always because my own initiative you know that
eh if i want to buy a book or i want to buy some cd or i want to buy some ticket for a concert or to the movies or whatever
you're in new york mhm are you from argentina don't tell me
but that's it because i wanted never because i have received a spam and i have opened it and have bought because i don't read it directly you know i erase it
then don't and when i receive something in my mail that i have not asked for it the same i send it to the trash directly you know i don't even read it
and sometimes so man it is also true that sometimes i read it but mh no generally i am never interested in it and have you bought something
mhm
mmh
ok ok
in addition the greatest part of these things are i mean they sell you things of that then then they don't send them they take your money
they send you a lowquality product i mean they sell you these things they are not that are you they are totally because they sell you no well they sell this look that and then maybe once
i have met people who have bought and have said well this is shit this is a thing that breaks in two days or
or it breaks or you know that then they are not quality things because if you say
ah i'm sorry because you had the  cho you know like you have the new  chor well i thought i mean this one is argentinean
if you said well because this this is well it is so it is what no but all this is from spam it is all everything is trash
it is a like it is like the yes eh yes it is like the like the sale that of of of and all those catalogues that there are of
of really absurd things like that well one thing to scratch your back and that is a and have you seen these catalogues of things of stupid things stupid
have you seen that i mean really stupid things
yes that for example a
and have you seen that comes out it is like some booties that have a plug to heat your feet have you seen that
yes and things like that no that they sell you like that goes the lady like that mr with the feet well into the little boot who
gets warm and gets warm the fee and i sometimes who is going to buy this my mother
sure
mhm
ah ok ok
yes
yes
ah no no to the ones that call lby phone yes to those ones i directly say no
i am sorry i am sorry i am not interested and that's it and i hang down the phone
yes
ok man you don't know what happens also to me i feel a little sorry people who work in those things it is nothing don't laugh but it is true
i feel i feel a little sorry for people who who who have to work and make a living calling then you know treat a man i am not interested and of course i say i am not interested and i hung up
but i try to be a little nice because you know that people are working and making a salary calling as telemarketers calling well it is not pleasant to them either
that people mistreat them and insult them that they hang up the phone without answering you know because i have try i have worked well all
i don't know when i was younger and i was a student and that well well i had well i continue being a student but when i was younger
how do what did you say your name is
well man and well in summer you know you have well a i worked as a telemarketer and no it was not selling no i didn't sell i
i received calls i mean no i didn't make calls
and i was working for a provider from in spain and i was working also for an insurance company
and the that it was what is it called here like roadway assitance
and i called people who wanted stayed the car had broken down and we sent a tow truck to take the car to a shop and such
and i of course i mean i worked eight hours a day and there is a moment when you've had enough i mean you've had enough that people call you with problems
and well and insulting you and telling you that that let's see if assistance arrives that and such i mean treating you badly when it is not your fault at all because i was the last monkey
i was just another guy in the company and i didn't know anything you know whether the company is good or bad or what they just paid me to to
answer calls and give a service the best i knew then you know that's why i feel a little bad for people who call you
because this people that call you have no intentions of getting you mad people that call have no intention of annoying you the people that call you want to eat like you and me you know
atri
and you want to have a job then
don't know i feel a little bad that is that that yes no that not because i feel bad i am going to buy a product that they sell that that would be the height
but you know but at least treat them fine and tell then look i am not interested that is it because the people like they say do not have attitude here in united states
is one is one of the things that i notice i notice the cultural difference no and the what in spain we call be be a  edge
yes that i do not know or i mean you know you need to be  edge because people get on top of the chepa no to the beard but
when there is no need to be  edge then there is not you know
now
sure sure
yes yes
hey and count odri that makes him a peruvian with an argentinian accent from new york
ah oh oh odri like odri
aha
aha
mm
ah i understand
ah that's what it is
mhm
ah i understand
that's goo that's good very good
aodri hi how are you
yes
no yes i ohm
to me that when i open my email and i see a lot when i see that it makes me ay i say ay this because some times it tells me like
five nine messages and i want to see who has written and i see there are five new and four
they directly to the trash
no yes but the good thing is that for example the service i use for the mail
what is it called no i use gmail then
yes they can and you can assign
that like they like i don't know how they do it but they have a way of of verifying that like it is spam and it they put it in another folder
then ah it works no i am going to say that ninety percent of the time it works very well
i my name is aodri and i'm in new york
yes
yes mm i think
i believe that most of of the services of the technical of mail have that now because is is like an invasion because they try in any way to put
words like it was a conversation and it is not only in english because i'm going to tell you that
i also receive too much in spanish eh
my personal mail and my work mail also i receive too much too much too much
then you never have bought nothing from a spam
no i don't i don't but i remember that maybe one year ago i read an article in the newspaper about a man that
in itself he loves buying things stupid things
that he lives off of that and i but it seems to me i have never met someone that
no i'm peruvian
that has bought from spam because but everyone it makes them angry when they see that blessed spam that this the other and i
yes
yes it is it is poor taste
yes yes no yes you know something that
maybe if there is a reason to have it but it is a thing like what to spend the money because eh
yes yes
no but you know what i ever say i say someone has to be buying this for them to do the way they do
and and they put la laws like that in the state of virginia is illegal
to dens a spma an electronic mail not requested
but the same a lot arrive horrible ones arrive
you are not the first person don't worry
it is similar to the ones that call you by phone ay ay that makes me that makes crazy when i see
yes
no no no no i am not that sweet with them no no no i tell them no to the thing they do with my name take out my name immediately
so there is one thing i don't know if it is federal or for the state yes it was make by our governor and that is from a cover
and you can can put your name and if someone calls you has to pay a penalty because it says they should not call
yes i i have my boss my former boss the thing he used to do when they called from a one of those cards for a raffle in the house or whatever i don't know
eh from the mortgage he used to say wait a moment and he left them waiting because he said look when i have to talk to customer service of anything a credit card the bank or i don't know
they always put me in wait for a long time the i love to tell them
wait and he left them there and that one thing by him he loved doing that
ah
but tell me
yes
yes
ah ok ok
yes
yes
yes
you're right not always is that way but no i will not lie when say no i'am always there no and no and i do not want ay
because is the same thing especially when they call my cell phone i say ah
in the middle of the day or sometimes at work i know what and i look like i have a lot of things to do
nobody has them but i have the balls
odri
good eh you know this is is a halfway big count i'm good first i'm good eh i was born here with peruvian but also my parents are gone
good children of your country anyway
neither of my parents have peruvian decent nor does my grandma have it and my grandfather also does have it
eh my grandfather lived in argentina for a decade and
he was eh he was forced to take all of the argentinian culture
and yes but my mother has very little left
and it's good that i have it i have it very strongly but it's because i worked to study in argentina
but anyway hit me if i'm wrong but i am not a legal professional
aodri
yes yes exactly exactly
well what you think of unsolicited mail
hello greetings
music stood that was her throwing a pi a dish to the floor because we we trying to
sorry
uh but you know we spend the whole day listening to music
classical or you know for for playing or whatever and we listen to it in english and spanish
so when her/his father is at home we speak only in english
but when he goes to work we only speak in spanish
so but uh and you
right
right
uh um um
my name is anni and i'm calling from miami
uh um um
hm mm
yes
ahh
hm mm
yes
hmm mmm hmm mm we
well we had a
not a bad time but my daughter stilllike two months ago that she started to sleep during the nights entirely
but when she was seven eight years we would take her from our bed
hello
to her crib and i couldn't you know i had much difficulty in putting her to sleep and finally i found out that yes i eh i would put music with a sound machine
you know she sleeps well and now eh we bought her an ipod
because eh what i do is that i have you know a month and like hundred or more cds
then i can select whatever i want her to listen normally when we send her to sleep
we take you know the songs of cradle i think they're called
them eh i put some music turn on the machine of the sound machine
so we read her some books and so when she hears that you know she goes to sleep by herself she sleeps better i then eh put her to sleep in the cradle and in five minutes it's done
sleeping yes and that for that reason was that we bought the the ipod
because even when we are in our car she wants her songs and to have all those you know more that five hundred cds in the car
and them she is to like someway she isn't sometimes eh she acts like a baby
okay
then we bought the ipod with the money that she
she herself you know
that she worked in uh herself
yes yes
we did it well part hers and partly mine because i have my music there too so you know
yes so
well probably ninety five percent hers
and you know because that's how we are in a place whatever because the her little car too
it has like uh an earphone
but with that and and when we bought it i thought who's gon na put a you know a walkman or something and that's what i'm doing now
hmm mm i'm i'm coming out
yes me too
hm mm
yes yes i understood don't worry yes
yes
no but look we are going to have the eh our next baby
god willing in a week
and you know that's what we're doing we're going to the to a maternity center that we have here and that's what we're going to do
because you know for me the first one was a csection and
no and it wasn't because i wanted to it was supposedly for an emergency
but i think that okay
yes no it doesn't matter
that's okay so
you know a so we're going to do that and with here she doesn't watch any tv
you know uh and oftentimes when we go to church and they teach her you know with the little elmo dolls
or whatever she just looks at me like what's that yea people look at me like how does she not know who elmo is and i say well we don't watch tv
uh huh
yea
yes
yes
yes
yes
music
well also you know i since we are having a baby i was thinking that we shouldn't let her
watch television but i was looking for an educational show that i could let her watch but
yes but i still i couldn't
yes but
the thing is what happens is that i i know that television i won't have a problem eh to get her interested in it
and i rather yes i can try to until she's around three or four years old
that she continues with her love for books and music and all that i much prefer you know that we continue with that i don't know
if when the baby arrives that that i'll feel that for me to be able to put to have a little bit of time you know
the most i'll do if i do it will be half and hour a day and it's going to be a program that i know that
you know is educational
ah music eh we spent the whole day listening to music i have a little girl of twentythree months
but
well the biggest problem we have is that we we don't watch much tv
but if you come inside our house you think we watch a lot of tv because our house came with
came with those fiftytwo inch televisions
so also last christmas we bought a tivo
then we recorded the thing you already know those old movies and or programs that we are interested but
but it is nothing we never see abc nbc or any of those
it is always the discovery channel or what you already know things like that like the history channel
but because of that reason because i don't want her to see telivision my husband is watching least television
because when he is in the house she is awake no you know we don't turn it on
and no i don't let her watch tv but i always have
then that was one of the difficulties we still have a bit that he he like you know he understands that i don't want that she watch television
but he does not understand that if he is watching television she is watching
mhum
hello
uh hmmm
oh yes
oh okay okay
is like giving her permission
yes that is the problem i have with mine i say because also i don t watch television i am always in the room
oh ok
no it's ok don't worry
uh um
oh ok
uh um
oh yeah ok i understand
oh well i uh normal i i uh i listen to every kind of music
i don't i don't have a favorite i can listen to anything even music in another language
um and yeah i spend all day long listening to different music because like they says music soothes
greetings ah my name is jenny and i'm calling from new york
even the wildest animal uh uh um i think it's like that so at times i work from from home
and i also work in the court so when i'm not in the court arguing something i'm at the house and in those moments when you feel the most agitated
ah it's the best moment to turn on the radio and hear something to calm you and to put you back in the
in the mode of thinking of what should be uhm not yet i don't have kids but uhm i lasted several years working in a day care
and that was the best when one wanted to
one class of of eighteen kids of four years to calm down
put some some music classical
and it seems to change the entire more of the room because it affects the sound of of the human animal like they say
so hm mm
oh okay
ah okay hello
hm mm
hm mm hm mm
okay
hmm
hmm
ya
hmm
wow so then she knows the routine
hmm
yeah right is better bringing the ipod that
um could you hold for a minute the phone is ringing in the other line and i would be back immediately
hmm
oh
right
so it it's more or less like her vagrancy what you did
oh good that's a good idea
well oh sure it's not going to be her music only
oh oh no it'snot like that
oh wow
uh um
yes
okay
no that's the best it's the best because i'm telling you the point of view of a person that was a teacher
the music that is the the kids that the parents they they let them the they cultivate their love for music it's so much as um teaching them to read
because it helps them with concentration with uh the movements if if one observes kids sometimes it when they listen to piano music
with their little fingers as if they were playing piano all of that helps
for the uh development i forgot i forgot how to say development in spanish
well for the development that's it the development of the child for e for yesterday so you're working marvels because i always thought that i say to my husband all the time when we have kids
there are certain things that you may think are a bit crazy y was telling him that i want
you know that i want to give birth in a bath with water with music and he goes aha you are half crazy
hm mm
oh wow
hello
hm mm yeah
uuh
oh ok oops sorry it's the dog sh sh quiet
i'm sorry
uh huh
that's best yea
hm mm
no that's that's best the best method to to assure the success of the child to keep all that away from the that's the problem with my husband
well i tell him because his mom was a little strange because she taught him she let him to he was always right in front of the tv
and i don't know if i even had a tv until i was thirteen years old my mom and dad never bought a tv we didn't have any of that so he finds it strange
excuse me what was the subject of this call
that i was always ahead in school in the school system i was always ahead uh i finished college early he was waiting on me everything i've done i've done it quickly
and easily and he i don't know i always tell him it was because i didn't have all the d distr distractions i didn't have a tv to take an hour or two
from my studies you know it was always it was focused yea my mom and dad we were poor but yea one of us wanted to play music and my mom and dad would do what they could to take us for music lessons
you know if we were interested in animals we'd go to a museum
on the weekends or you know there was always something educational so you grow up little by little i mean when you're uh a teenager
you grow up and and you see the difference and from your friendships you know about all that that they know about that
and you feel weird but then when you become more more mature now i look back and say thank you i always tell my mom and dad than thank you so much because now i
i can buy all the things i want if i want an ipod i buy one i have one
if i want uh a playstation we have one here but mostly it's just there picking up dust
because we never use it i'm not interested and my husband says if you are not sitting down to play with that thing i won't play with it either
ah okay well start yes yes you want to start
so it's just there i also see the benefit of not wasting my youth away
hm mm
well there are many shows nowadays
there are not that many uh channel 13 has some around two that are okay two that have the approval of the school system
in new york
hm mm
hm mm
no
hm mm yea
well i i trust i don't know you but i trust that you will do a wonderful job because of the way i hear you talking
oh okay
is everything that in my mind i saw and said okay this is what i want to do this is what i want to see and when i talk to my husband he ah
i don't know i don't know but
but i know i'm listening and i realize that he is good you know all you say is perfect no there's nothing
that i would do different so to speak
hm mm
oh my goodness okay

hm mm hm mm
oh yes that's the best
yes mhum

where can they have but eighty hundred two hundred songs constatly they have those in their ears listening to music
yes not me do not like yes i from time to timeyes yes like that to relax or in the car or if i go exercise i also like to hear music
aha
ah
yes i like to wake with music thus my alarm clock also is a music player then when it alarms in the morning rather than the sound of those that
kills your heart
is is the music that we have here inside the music player then it is good because it wakes you little by little
aha
when you arrive here in houston you will go out often to dance salsa
aha
yes i encountered a group of people there where i go to school that dance salsa and go out often but now no now i don't have time to go out anywhere
but later i did not i like when i became tired of going out because i had already gone to all those same places and seen the same people and
always the places were but too full of people then i want to dance and if i could not dance and almost could not dance and the people stepped on you or strike you when they are circling then i had already tired of that
besides that you have to pay a lot to get into those places
it's like ten fifteen dollars to get into those places so not anymore i now go out but i rather go to a quiet place
yes where you just sit and talk and
mhm
aha
wow but why do they bring wellknow groups or what aha
wow but that's because you live in a very big city
hello
si in house no the next day we left the hospital the next day after it was born
and well i don't go out that much too many problems you go out and
oh think the call dropped
everything was good and no we were only there after he was born after the bird twenty four hours and that was all
yes
every two hours we must feed him
well they are nursing him
so you don't have to worry about giving him formula or anything
it's okay no that nothing nothing one or two times he awakes but that is all only to be with them there
that's how it is
yes
ah yes
ah i'm manuel of chicago
how come you have told me nothing of it
hurray
yeah
okay
yes i also receive one e mail from them
yes yes it told me something about that but uhm i i i don't say that i was stopping of of participating just only told me that it was
that it was thinking it was for her
ah
how are you
ah
yes she speaks well
it is weird you get in the car with her she drives a van a caravan
ah when i was in nebraska with them i drove once and it was weird
i used it several days and took her cd case
i said maybe she has music in spanish
and you are not going to believe it she had like 60 or 70 cds
all of them in spanish and then i asked her jenny why do you have music in spanish i mean why don't you have music in english and she said no i like music in spanish only i don't like music in english
oh i said that's good
yes she knows everything i don't know how long she has been practicing spanish or speaking spanish she speaks very well

but they're like i'm not sure about four years old
three or four years
yeah and she had she has children from her previous marriage
oh they have only one daughter
from my brother's
yeah
oh yes one of them is a wrestler
but you know wherever you go you'll gon na find good and bad people
yes
excuse me
yes i did notice that they are so i think that since this town doesn't have many hispanics in fact there aren't any
you know in places where there are many hispanics many well they start to get along with the wrong people bad people
so americans start looking down at us not anymore to him
i mean a hispanic they think we are all the same they think
and since there are none here they don't have
yes they don't go like this one is mexican he's not going to do that he's going to do this
no i think that they haven't they haven't met many mexicans
and because of that they don't since there are no mexicans there they don't have problems
you know when mexicans have a party they finish at one or two in the morning and they play the music at a very high volume like that
and over there there isn't any of that until just now just now in a bit more hispanics will start arriving
i am a father again

of course
oh ok and is everyday different
oh five consecutive days
oh
sure
i am there right
sure
ah
i do i listened music too but um i also listen but a lot there was a lot of time that i stopped listening music and i started listening
problems conversation programs
about politics
but it's like after a long time i get use to it and i forget to listen music and the days pass by without listening to music
and the i realize that your music i mean the music really changes your mood
form for the rest of the day no
so now i started listening music to have better mood
because i don't know it would be because of our latin blood i guess
and you are you are ah where did you say you were from from
but one needs
need that you know that that the dancing music that music
yes because here i do not listen to much music like that of that style
right
no i like everything now
before when i was in chile i did not like salsa or merengue nothing like that now that i am here i love it
now the only thing i need to do is to learn it that's all but i love it
no they do not have it here nothing latino no merengue nothing of nothing here
no because there are very few latinos here
most ones here are like unique they are mexicans
puerto rico
but on tv on the radio there is nothing nothing spanish nothing latino
on tv no none
no nothing
so that we are in the middle of nowhere
yes it's boring
boring when i went to california to visit i was to
and how long have you been here
long time
i am well i have been living here for ten years this year
not so long yet but seems a lot right
it has started getting cold but not as cold as chicago
that's right
cristina i am chilean and i am here in idaho
oh i heard that is terrible terrible
my brother in law lives in chicago too
yeah uh i don't know because i didn't i didn't see where they lived but he goes to the university of chicago
and i think they live nearby i think over the university apartments probably
so i don't know where
yeah the music
and what music well being from puerto rico what music do you like
bachata what's bachata
right
oh yeah
how are you
yeah i have heard something yes
and so and so so living in chicago didn't you struggle to maintain uh the music you listened back at puerto rico didn't you
because a lot
because it isn't there's a lot there's a lot of var i mean there's a lot of variety here in chicago
so you didn't miss that a lot didn't you
oh that's great
i see
i see
aham
oh yes yes yes
you are there in chicago no
oh so great
ah what
ahm really
yes here in idaho nobody comes then
no
that is so awesome
aha
then you don't feel as far from from where you come from eh yes
there is all that
yes here in idaho no there is nothing here here the only music there is is music more like mexican like
oh
i don't know what's it's called but it's like  skippy or i don't know how
but it's music that i haven't heard over there in chile either
and of course there in chile you listen to music more like i don't know boleros too and
stuff like that but of course you miss it here because you don't hear you don't hear much of that and no one comes here either so you don't have
true
concerts or any of that and yea i missed it so much that i'm now listening to satellite radio
and that's how i could i have been able to remember now many songs in spanish because after like ten years finally listening to songs that are playing now
that stuff like reggaeton and all that
i had no idea about that because it's been like ten years since i listened to music in spanish
and it's music in spanish
and what time is it there
oh sweet
aha
ofcourse
ofcourse
yes it's good having music in spanish because
because in english it's good but it's not the same
but it is not with what we've been raised or anything like that eh
if now i'm happy with wiith listening to music in spanish once again because really it makes a difference
in my mood and all of that

of  daddy yankee  don omar  tego calderón  ivy queen
no it's not the almost
almost the same
aham aham aham
no no no because back then
back at puerto rico i listened to the boleros and salsa but i don't really like boleros nor salsa because they aren't danceable
they're more romantic
but we use a lot the merengue
that like olga tañon elvis crespo
good
ah here in in chicago they do a lot of ah puerto rican parade
and they were invited they are invited this year came  ivi queen which is the the the the babe of reggeaton

and they are free many come come ah much much ah they do something that says  long live chicago
and they take lots of music from colombia from mexico from all parts of puerto of of the world
aha aha aha
thank you aha it is a little cold and a little hot
aha
aha
right
no
right
right right
right
right right
oh because now here in chicago we have a station that's nine hundred three point one fm
that plays reggaeton all day long
hmm
right so specially when you're driving in your car
that you don't get bored put on the radio on high and the travels seem
quick and you don't get bored you don't fall asleep in the car or anything
listening to music
aha
no no
aha aha aha
aha
it's like that music i don't know if you're listening listened to the music that has when they are one waits for another person
i got the phone to speak that music i don't like because it's music like like classic and it's music when you go
aha
when you go on an elevator
you have music for me for me
it's not beautiful and they should change it put on music ah merengue or bachata or music
ah like like cumbias cumbias are beautiful
aha aha aha
aha aha aha no it's that ah you go to sleep waiting
look this very minute i was waiting ah fifteen minutes to ah to be able to communicate
aha the other time i was waiting half an hour and when i went to to communicate with someone they hung up because supposedly it was eleven at night
they already hung up on calls
aha aha aha
it is it is twenty to eleven
how many times have you talked
oh yeah i've already been with this
is thirteen
ajá
no no they call you you can call and after five of the afternoon you can call to anyone after five
to anyone you like
no no just once
yes
ajá
ohh
and at and there
ajá ajá
ohh
ohh
good lord you are missing a lot you are missing twenty tree
because the last time they put it for politics
i called and no one picked up the phone no one did it
but you know i receive calls each afternoon at 5 pm
that if i want to pick up the phone to talk but i do not pick up the phone because i do not know what they are talking about
how is the music this is the second time that i talk
i have talked with many people from nebrasca philadelphia miami
one time yes i am tammy again well and you oh my goad
because he can not have all of them and that is bad because if you don't take things as you are supposed to take them
they will not help you so that makes you scared
that is it mja or from welfare
assistance that is given to them here isn't much and it is hard to get and you have to show ehh to show that your need is real
you have this but no matter what and if you do what it takes to get it you have to be working
and and if you do not know they do not pay you well but they pay you twenty dollars or a little more than twenty dollars from the
or i think it is less than twenty dollars from what the the limit that they will give you does not help
i say this because it is twenty dollars over the limit that they have but really that is not a lot
and they do not want to so they prefer that you do not work
so that they are able to help you but the help that they give you is not enough for you to be able to survive
no yes here well i think that some things are good but others are not
no so they are giving you something but they can't they do not help you
they don't want to help you because you do a lot supposedly and a lot isn't enough you can't survive on this and you have to work so that you can make enough for them to help you
not that much it is hard mija is very hard for persons to try and do that i believe that i imagine that is why some people work under the table
because they can not say that they are working because then they will not help them and they have children well that is another thing
no no that is why i was seeing my son my child that crazy comes to my home and tells me hey mom so why do you not want apply to the government for them to give me lunches
i say hey we make too much for them to give us lunches i thing i give you to but lunches and i give you the paper
four childern wait four persons in the home they want you to make about twenty four thousand dollars
that is not enough in a year that is not enough
four persons not especially if i take those persons with a baby
because i say that i say it is a le i was showing my husband and i tell him them people are crazy who is doing i say where you work and where you live because here where i live
especially the one for older people they they don't give them enough money or or it is not because of the money but that they need medical help the pills are not completely covered
well that miracle that when my son moved he found an apartment eh close to us and it was seven hundred twenty five a month and that is cheap
mja no that do not include nothing them you can imagine with two
so i say that if a person has four people in the house and it has been twenty and four thousand that he can not he can not
so that for me because of that that i always that talk with my children be careful work take care of your your credit and save your money
because what is mha do you recall now that i spoke with you yesterday
my son is back the oldest one that had moved this one in my house again he already fought with his girlfriend and the girl did something bad to him and that man my son when you do something bad to him he says good bye and like that never will see you again
so he got all of his things my husband went over there and took all of his things and there isn't anything else of his in that apartment anymore
now it really happened
aha the very bad that this man got like that when he called me mom so and i tell him i support you so come over here here i i will convince him so he can go to the to school because
yes he was but now he is i want well he can go ehm ehm the people from work said that he can go to the school in the morning
then it is more difficult for them you know to take their pills because they have to think about that i have to pay for the pills or do i have to eat
and to work after that so they will help him so i tell him well i tell him if you move here if you go to school i will not charge you for rent
but if you don't want to go to school you are going to have to pay rent because i want him to finish school
because is going i say too many things especially with him yes he does not want to finsih school it will be difficult to get things so i want
mja so that right yes if because that's what i say then something happens to him and you don't do he feels you'll end up asking for help you are a man and i say no
there is no need as young as he is to not finish his things having us here when we can help him and he does not accept it
i always give him the example of the people we know look you don't wna to end up there work hard
um yes and like it's there in canada with him with this the insurance
mja
aha mja aha
aha
because they have to pay more and also sometimes also there are people who abuse i know people who well they are not my friends but i know that they have they are abusing
aha
no yeah i do not know we when my husband came from he was in the air force
then we arrived here and he also does not pay that much that was in like 92
and then when we arrived here it was insufficient to be able to pay the rent and like that we came into the program for a month
sufficiently to be helped and for the time it took for him to find work so he took a month
well he found a job within a month but you know that the next paycheck then it took us a month and we came out one time from there but when one goes to the store with those they one of them that they give you are like fake papers
the people they if when you go out shopping and that was years ago so today i believe they give you a card
but the people give you mean looks
aha yes because no because no because they are giving you help and you see that you can work we can work but they did not have any with my two children i told myself that i could not work because where would i leave the little ones that i have i could have paid someone and i did not have anything to pay them with
and then i told my husband never again never
of those uses that real people that other people really need
i say that i work whenever before i would get into that and the always has told me that under i do not put my family like that
so that because it is how they look at you bad i say no man because you are asking for a little help
because it cou things didn't turn out well or but is is very difficult
aha they don't recall people that don't recall about that
but i not i am not like that when i see people that have in the need i say it can happen to anybody from one day to the next it happened to me
so that and well ahm i say
mja what i say they are not stealing they didn't go crazy and start stealing they are
they went because they had to go and ask for help and maybe they didn't want to do that but they had to
mja
no no ah eh what what well they send you a check
ok but it is difficult i have my wedge my mother of my husband
well that was in ninety two is what i remember they send you a check and then they send you a little book
little like the monopoly money
and it was like five dollars twenty dollars and you had to take it out of there and give it to the person and they didn't give you change
it's like you had to try to have the adequate because i say no say it's that
mja and so had to they had to be sure that you didn't use it for alcohol such that looks bad and so i think now with the card it is better
and she is partially on assistance but no they don't help her much and there are she has to search for coupons and things like that to see if she can buy medicine in another place that is cheaper or
to buy a medication this month or to buy another medication the next month
betsy hello how are you
aha no
and and this is the welfare or pension or
that is it yes i can imagine
mja
mja
yeah
yeah
i see
but yeah but they don't pay you let's say for all the medicine you need
aha
here sitting seeing what you can tell me about social assistance or whatever because i have no idea
and what they help you with is not enough there is many ways anyway
yeah yeah
yeah but but after the eighteen years they no longer help when your children have there eighteen years they will no longer help
mja
aja
aja
twenty four thousand dollars a year oh my goodness for four persons no
aja
mja
mja but does not include utilities
aha aha
aha oh okay mha more expensive
mha it is not enough
mha that is that they don't spend it on things that they don't need
yes aha you already moved back
boy
wow
that girl must have done something very bad mm
well yes already and when he moved with the girlfriend he was not working oh aha
mha
like that it is good aha
oh
of course mja
mja or have a good career also i will not send him to work at mcdonald's forever
mja
mja
no not because he does not want to have that the government nor neither will help him
well they make you work here when we got here ah just got here from el salvador fifteen years ago and they gave us an apartment to rent and gave us
bed and furniture and but we had welfare
during a few months from there because we went to the school and from there my parents got a job and my brother and i were in high school
from there because my paretns were working they helped us because my brother was fifteen
and i already i already had eighteen they did not help us for for me just for my brother but i got into high school and did not work until until when
aha oh
yes but the put in me in the in the welfaresometimes before but i though that here they would help you a little because they give you a card for medicine
mja and he and he has to present it at the store where he will buy the medicine and and they will pay well that was the last time that i asked for assistance
but now ah now i do not know how it will be it should be more difficult
aha mja
aha
aha
how great
for real
oh aha
they look at you as if you were from another planet
mja
mja aha that is true
no
no
like mha
already they for sure they the same thing happened to them and they give you a dirty look it is like that
mh
oh yeah of course
why look bad at people who get govermental help it helps really it's not a big thing
aja yes
mja mja and what what it was like a little paper that said that the government would help and the people knew
mja
it's not money and they don't send you a check for your house or into your account

wow
why
hmm
a girl
she'll be two on november the 18th
hmm
ah no she she's very good she has her moments when you know she she doesn't listen to what i tell her
annie
but
when i talk to her and i ask her to do something she does it because if not then you know i make sure that she does it
because i want for her you know for her to behave good
therefore
she doesn't have the opportunity to be bad let's say
yes with my husband
ah
yes
no
i don't know
in miami
so you know the only thing we want is for it to be healthy
oh no today uh it was not too hot today was really nice it was hot but it was cloudy so then it was very breezy but probably the temperature was still around eighty eightyfive eightysix around there
but the humidity was not too high so then it was a very very hot day
because what does not not affect much here is only the temperature
but the humidity so then we have normally i think is about seventy eighty eighty percent of of of humidity
and we you leave the house
you know just as you get out you start to sweat because is as if someone is hitting you with a wet blanket
is very you know is very sticky and
but now we are getting into the time of year that is not not so bad we feel hot but the humidity goes down
but you know like for example i can wash my hair
ah
oh and i can be the whole night with my hair wet
because i'm not parched because there's a lot of humidity
and especially if i wash it in the morning and leave it in a in a little bun a bun
the hair i've left wet the whole day
so you know always it's n not the heat as much as the humidity i believe
so and over there it's cold or still is no
wow
and when you eh normally have snow
when you normally it begins to snow the time it snows and all that
then eh but when does it begin to snow
ah no i have never gone
because i thought that that it snowed in new york
didn't you tell me you were in uh you live in new york
ok
i think ok
ok no i thought that it snowed in new york that's why i was asking you
oh i'm sorry
no no uh my parents are from um dominican republic
but i was born in puerto rico
and my father too
and puerto ricans too
ah twentyish
um
hmm
yeah from haiti
yes from haiti
from haiti
from jamaica
i don't think so i mean we have a house but my husband is the only one who works and we have to you know
no we don't have a luxurious life
we we have enough money to buy what we need food pampers
you know pay the the electric bill whatever but we we don't have anything to go on vacation you know nothing at all
wow
we have what we need but
you know we only own one car we don't have two cars and here usually people have
two cars
no no we have one car
no we own a house it's a pretty small house
eh we have three bedrooms
and two bathrooms it's not big and around here some of the houses are very very very expensive
so you know i'm telling you we have what we need
but it's not a life of luxury
and we don't have you know we are not starving and no we don't need more clothes
so then were you born in new york
but as i am not working i stay with my my daughter
it makes us difficult
am i think that yes look we i almost a year has passed from when i bought clothing i buy my girl's clothes in a in a consignment shop
and you know we save a lot of money that was but i don't go shopping i don't do lot of you know i don't
do shopping either because the clothing is to expensive
so then we normally buy clothes we go eh from shops like costcos
o or sams something like that
and if we something that suits us and is good we buy it there
but me go shopping no i don't do that what
you know that thing doesn't matter to me you know yes yes i have lot of clothes and i don't care if it's branded or what
hello
yes oh nice es hmmm we have to talk about travels where have you traveled to
because i'd have made three trips three flights i mean i have no money left to go anywhere else so i think that when i finish school i'm going to take some
time off on holidays before i start again i'm going to work to
yes or to go some place where i want to go a different place no not just to visit family
mhm yes yes and usually when you start working they don't let you take time off
i've heard of companies that tell you that you can't take time off during the first three months you can't go on vacations and some other companies say it's six months
so yes how's your baby doing

mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
mm

alaska

mhm
yes the boss i had before went to the antartica or south pole

and ah she loved it there are cruises you can take to go to alaska you take it from california and then take you to alaska
and then you get to see all glaciers and all the mmm
mhm

ah yes no
it costs time and money
yes yes is difficult no is that i like
aha
no no you tell
right mhm
mhm
mhm
yes
right yes is difficult to go see your family and go on holidays and and more when you marry because you have to se your family and
oh
your wife's or husband's family
then there time is up and the and vacation and the money and all goes there
yes yes
mmh
mmm yes of course
mmh
mmh
of course yes
yes yes i love traveling i hope now that i start working as a nurse and i start to to have money to be able to travel
to the wherever i want to go but yes i eh i have been to europe and i have been in costa rica and guatemala i have been in mexico but only in mexico city
ah sure yes
in puerto vallarta and chiapas
ah i was in eh in san cristobal and ah where else was i in chiapas in eh i don't remember but ah and i was in ah in taxco also when i was
yes when i was in mexico
ah yes yes i have a friend that loves to travel she loves to travel but to stay long in other countries she just got back from being abroad two years in
in taiwan and when i ran into her in mexico she had been six months in mexico and so she was touring the whole country
and i rant into her when i was in chiapas so ah that's how we went to san cristobal and to guajaca and then we went to taxco and we returned oh
i returned she stayed
ah from mexico city ah well she was studying
she was studying so eh what she did was she took the classes as independent studies so while she was studying and taking classes she was traveling in mexico
yes yes then ah when i did ten trips with her i didn't spend hardly anything because we stayed at hostels i don't know how i don't remember what you call them
a break ah
but i mean you can stay there you stay there and you have to sleep in a room with a lot of people no but we didn't pay anything we paid like
two dollars or three dollar a night
but almost everyone is a student and you have to share a room with people that you don't know but
no yes they are people that
who is doing the same as
they come to travel like so and they want to spend little money so they stay like so and then that was good but i also went to europe and i stayed a month also in
traveling to europe but that ended up being expensive but my parents helped me because it was my present for graduating from the university so yes but after i was in houston
i have only gone to aruba which is in the north coast of venezuela
yes and that is an island like puerto rico but i didn't like it it is a a famous tourist site in the carribean but i didn't like it
because puerto rico is also an island and puerto rico is a lot greener and this island aruba is deserted there is nothing
fine fine you said you work in construction right
absolutely nothing the only thing is that the beaches are beautiful but aside from the beaches there is nothing to see
in aruba yes
yes it is very dry there is nothing absolutely nothing it's very flat and the only thing that there is is rocks everything is very rocky and the
beaches are also rocky
yes the sand is white and the water is very clear and you can see you can see beyond the water it is very clear blue
but but no there is nothing else to see absolutely nothing else
like that so i didn't like it but that but yes i am lucky that all my family is in puerto rico and and except a sister that i have who lives in florida
the all the rest are in puerto rico but still now for example i went to visit my sister in florida and then in august
and then i traveled to puerto rico to visit my family and in december i'm going to canada to visit my boyfriend's family
so i don't have any time or money left to go anywhere else
hi
hmm the the best one can do no
ah yes mexico
nothing more to mexico and here and here in the united states have gone to different parts
ah on vacation not work on vacation
eh
texas
when i was in texas traveled from there to here
i have family here and there
i travel now i'm here for i'm coming or nebraska with my brothers my brother over there
i have family in arizona all my uncles
ah i'm manuel from
all uh almost the whole family from my mom is here in the us
plus several states i have other in wisconsin too i´m going there many times
that it stays me near
so what will you tell for travel when you have time i like do it in the car driving here
because you go to stop and rest when you like it
that's with the family you have to stop to rest
if you go in a bus you are going to stop only once and its very uncomfortable
and nothing else
ahh grand cannon
yeah
chicago how are you
ohh its beautiful
it's very nice although it's very very much like a dsertic zone
but there are many beautiful things
well i have family in twos states in durango and monterrey
ah in monterrey there are many it's like how can i say it they have many kind of touristic places where you can walk eh know
it's an industrial city ther are many how can i say it many things to do there aren't this kind of things but it's very nice
there are two i don't know exactly what they are like rivers one is called horse tail
they are like very big waterfalls very tall
many people visit them from different parts as well
it's very nice
fine fine working
oh yes i would like to visit alaska
yes
go to meet what it is
eh exactly what it is really cold
i would like to be there
yes
yes
yes i had known before
yes yes i like enough to go to meet there
but sometimes there is no time
yes
and when
when you sometimes have the time you don't have money
what happens is
how yes tell me
oh what happens is that i tell you like when you you have holidays you what is that good at least i ah i try to
go out to see my family go visit them sometimes ah
though two or three years without seeing them
you have and opportunity of course but i prefer to see my family taking walks too i don't know
eh we are like very united we visit each other allot
and that's good you have times that is better to go out and see the family
yes the call just came in and i said eh well i'll rest a bit do something entertaining
oh talking about that is another issue
yes well actually time because the ah i'll tell you that money i don't spend much when you go see family i don't spend much like when you go to
i don't know that you go on a trip to see different ah cities or countries
there you spend more because you have to spend on hotels food
and of coures you go to see wherever you go you are going to spend money
to go out with the to visit family you do spend i don't tell you you don't but
you don't spend as much
it is very different
that's great
oh yes
eh
oh taxco
on vacation
yes i with the vacations
oh
mm how nice
mm
but like that at least you know you are in with people there's no you're not in danger rather over there
these are are
oh excatly people who are in the same
okay
how are you
it's deserted there
yes
yes
notice
mm
that's right
to rest
well that's fine too because once you start working you will be starting and you don't know how your life is going to turn out since your whole life is going to change right
mhm
you see
yes
oh very well thank you
yes he's fine he's getting bigger he was born on a wednesday and we took her to the pediatrician on saturday
and she had gained about a pound
uh the doctor was telling us right i was there uh well we were talking to him for a while he told us that it's very good that she gained weight because many children
when they're born they usually tend to get a little thin lose weight
and and this girl didn't lose on the contrary she gained weight
she's doing fine
uh um well i hope she keeps like that without having problems
yes
ah betsy yes you're talking to alex again how are you
and to jibrartal and i liked it very much but the southern part of spain where the beaches are
i got robbed to at at a subway train
and they took my wallet
and they stole like i don't know a hundred dollars
yes or maybe more what in spain
and in colombia where where it's so famous for those things of
nothing was stolen to me because that was one of the reasons that i always too good precautions
and in spain when you are taking precautions
yes yes and you know something there was a terrorist attack in there too
yes some trains were blownup they set up bombs people it was due to arab terrorism
and lots of people died in spain this happened in the train stations that i used
eh they were very pretty landscapes
to take a few years ago i used to be on those places where the attacks took place
about a year ago
yes so you know if something bad is going to happen to you
it will happen no matter where you are
but i didn't have the money to stay very long
and that always me it frustrated me and then if i would win a prize and i had the money
and also the time and of course when one has money one must have time
and then me i would love to travel to spain and visit the
there are many castles and interesting things there
ah many things of the of the of the old world many roman things ah it's interesting it's it's to know history
and but one needs money it's an expensive country especially for traveling
yes and no it's not very dangerous where i am columbia is very dangerous
fine then the subject of the trips
there one does not have fun even though it is a beautiful country
one is always afraid of the security of the country
no spain is better
dangerous
yes
also colombia is a fantastic country if there weren't what
you have great scenery and some tremendous mountains
yes and we have coast there as well but the problem is the war and the
the drug trafficking that has damaged the country totally and the image that they have of me is horrible
yes what more between the us is where you'd like to travel or between canada
yes something interesting
yes they have told me that it's nice but cold
yes
where do you live
there is no snow
impossible
you're very far north is there never snow
yes
because here in los angeles there's never snow maybe just in the mountains
yes
but if it falls if must fall because you're very far north betsy
yes i had a lot of different opinions
yes you're near alaska
yea near seattle washington
have you been to seattle washington
i'd like to go there
yes and also washington dc once i went to the capital
there are some nice things there museums i really like history so everything that has to do with history and like on classic city is montreal canada
they say that canada's really pretty
and no there's not really as much insecurity like there is here in the united states
here in the united states it's bad
it's almost almost like latin america now
right you want to start this time
yes that is why they criticize immigration here a lot because it is a lot of immigration here and it is a bad immigration
and it has spoiled the country very much
through through through out the years i have seen that this country has really declined and now in the united states there is a big difference between the rich and the poor
that did not happen before i think in canada there is more of a balance
there is there is not that much difference between a rich and a poor person in canada like there is here in the united states
but there are more social progprograms over there
and there isn't that much people there the problem here is that there is a lot of people
yes the country has gone down unfortunately yes a lot ehm
yes and it is dangerous
they can rob you they can do something to you there is a lot of poverty as almost like a latin country already i don't don't see much of a difference now
and what for
yes and you know the latin countries are known for the difference between the rich and the poor
and that is becoming the united states in becoming like that
yes but there are there are there are interesting things and one time i went to texas and i liked the views me
i have always liked the colombian plains
super hot but very pretty
and the plains of texas are similar a little more developed and oh the broiled meat i like it
and a lot of broiled meat was bought in those places ehm
it is interesting i would like to know texas more
through its views through the plains above all i love the plains the flats the kowboys i like them
and the barbecues
you husband is canadian
i love barbeques how they say in colombia the barbeques
and you find that a lot in texas
yes yes i think is one of the most interesting parts of the united states and i would like to visit seattle because of its cafes they say they have good coffee there
yes yes
there are volcanoes over there yes
yes i remember and the scenery must be beautiful over there
there's security
yes that's the problem with all the latin countries that have never been able to get ahead
yes i hope one day they can do it
yes yes but i've heard that the scenery there is very pretty because there's a lot of volcanoes
yes a cruise would be fantastic
and mountains and you know salvardor beaches how are they
big waves
because there is pacific and also the atlantic if
how many seas have only pacific
yes
yes
because colombia has the atlantic and also the pacific colombia has two seas
so it is a very nice country i tell you of colombia because beauty trumps many countries
tbe country is the worst but in beauty has much
just as it has many queen models
right i traveled one time to spain
but there are many bad things
yes there are many things i do not denied it you can not deny the truth
of that situation there are bad things
and not only that there is insecurities and uh
and when you do tourism you do not want to go to place where something bad could happen
right you want to travel to a place where where where there is not much insecurities
even though i tell you one thing that will scare you
i was never mugged in colombia
and i told you in spain i was once robbed in spain
yes madam must be
betsy yeah oh hi alex
yeah because i never got to go on a cruise before never did and you
really
how weird
aha
oh no

hi hello good evening where are you from
oh a lot and to for a since we talk about travelling have you travelled to puerto rico
oh yes
then ah you have not always lived in colorado you have traveled or travel just for vacations
oh no already not much yet just utah and i don't know utah and no the truth that no to i went to washington
to washington of course but no not to not to the east of course some day i hope to be able to no
oh to study
we came here after i graduated from from high school to to study at university here
a well it was to utah and there i met my husband and now we are living in idaho
but to chile we have only gone bak once five years ago and
we hope to go back now you know this coming year perhaps
from colorado and originally
oh not so much but it´s more expensive than idaho i think that if we were in florida or or california me colorado is by the north right
in the middle oh ok then down below but around the center
ohh then it is easier to easier to fly
right
oh no really
oh yes did you see that´s why we don´t go anywhere because only inuh anything costs more than three hundred dollars or something per ticket it´s very expensive
yes and have you traveled outside america like to europe or something like that or you have not had the chance
oh yes
what country what country would you live to travel to if you could
and yes in australia
ah i am i am in idaho and am from chile
yes look for me if i could pick i think it would be italy
yes i don't know italy yes i think italy but australia is huge australia there is so much to do there
oh
of course
oh you will stay
of course at least for five more years right
of course when she doesn't want anything to do with you for a short time right
of course right now is difficult
yes we have small children too and that makes it very complicated to travel somewhere else
ah of course
am in the united states ten years in idaho three
oh so you're going to take her there but what age are you planning to go
aha
oh look so she's constantly
hmm
of course
i can imag
of course
oh i can gue how old was she
oh so little she didn't understand yet of course
aha
yes a lot well it is like colorado no colorado has a lot snow
ah yes that is so
no but it's great that people like traveling because that way she is going to want to travel because there are people who really do not like traveling and can not believe that
who don't like to travel
of course
of course you have to be here responsible and already one who has children
put your feet on the ground for a while
i have heard it is really slow
many woods no
and how long have you lived there in colorado
wow
of course
mm
mm
oh and she was american or where was she from
ah
oh yes
of course well is that one changes a lot no
in those years
sure
or yes oh and she is from mexico
yeah
of course and puerto rico is not like that right
mhm
how rare no yes is very rich
now where does she live
yeah with the girl
ah then you can see her often
ah look how father
look how good
and it will be prettynow when if you are from puerto rico it does not cost you to come in and out of united states right
i have never understood what is united states stand with puerto rico because it is not a state it is a separate country but at the same time
yeah
o but no snow like
oh it has not been that long
sure
oh
independent
and how long have you been there
good night i am joe
oh no never no
oh i have many years here more than twenty years
well look that since a in ninetythree since my parents died was the last time that i traveled to puerto rico but i have traveled to other places i have gone to mexico
and i have gone to other places and parts of the united states also including florida which is a
one of my favorite places
and vacations to other states here there is a lot to see i don't know if you have had the opportunity to see other places here in the united states
but there are many very beautiful places
washington state that is very beautiful there
and how did you come to stay in idaho
ah
i am from colorado
yes
how great
and
and it´s very hard to travel from here to there because of things like passports and things like that
sure it is more or less in the center we are down below
yes it´s a centrally located for flights from here they travel a lot to south america
yes for example if i said that i would spend some vacations in cancun
and went there for three days with around three hundred fifty dollars
it would include the hotel and the flight yes
probably it would be easier for you to go to the state of washington or go to a more centrally located place and fly somewhere else if you´d like to
from puerto rico
no i´d love to go to europe my brothers that one of them lives in whichita kansas and the other one lives in puerto rico they travel a lot
they have gone to the whole europe and they´ve told me how beautiful it is right there paris spain
well i´d like one of my favorites is australia
yes and australia would be fascinating for me because very exciting there and also new zealand but i would also like to visit italy spain france all those places but i think australia is still number one
italy yes italy is beautiful
it's a lot of history yes well i have worked for a company where the president of the company was australian and he was the ceo of the company so there we made great friendship and all that
and he would always invite me to go there but i have a daughter of five years i am a divorced father
and have divided custodyw
so
i would never abandon her never leave her
from chile how great how long have you been there
yes yes when she forgets she has a father and starts to think in boyfriends yes
yes yes but right now well i am crazy for her and she is crazy for me
we have a great time
yeah right well i want to go to puerto rico next year so that she knows her puerto rican half because her mom is mexican
then i want her to meet that and she's crazy for going there and meeting her grandma grandma comes here every year and they do great with each other there's great chemistry
she well she's travelled so many times on plane
ah travelled more than me in the last three years because she goes to mexico with her mother at least two times a year
oh she's well used to travelling she's really calm i tell you the first time we travelled it wasn't on a plan but when we took a travel to wichita
we went on one of those greyhound and it was an awful experience because she was very little still and when she went on the truck
she was asleep but when she totally woke up she panicked
ten years oh and how do you like it do you miss your homeland a lot
i think she thought she had a very bad nightmare and people there was really uncomfortable and they said stuff
and it was awful that travel but
she was like two years old there
yes and i promised her that i was never going to take her in one of those buses there we call them buses
then well the next time we went on a plane a little plane and and we had a great time and she was very happy and not to mention it was only
one hour of travel compared to thirteen hours when we took the bus
yes
it was horrible
i would love to see the whole plane if i could
because i would love to travel all i coud but really the economy and situations it is very difficult for me
and does it change often this season changes of
yes exactly
yes exactly bes but you have if you have the opportunity go to other places come to colorado because colorado is very beautiful
it is beautiful you come here
it has many national forests they have majestic mountains they have attraction points also in the city they have many things they have a little bit of everything but you go here in the mountains and you go to places that are fabulous the beauty as is you were in a paradise
i've been living here twentysix years
it'll be twentysix in december yes well yes i came directly well i stopped for a while in new york for a very short time
then i came here with my first exwife
then we were married like ten years then we each went our separate way
but she was half puerto rican and half swiss
she was my high school sweet heart
from cold to hot or from hot to cold
yes well we got along well and we ended it fine is that at the end we realized we had different goals
change a lot yes yes
the mother of my daughter it was a super short marriage
it didn't even last two years
yes she is from oaxaca mexico
but we have a good father relation with the girl we work very well with her togetheras in fact today we went to her kindergarden school
then lets see what the teacher told us and the teacher gave a a good report on the girl because my girl is a good girl she has a good heart and
she has a very sweet voice that all the world love
has acts real good she's very respectful is a has much love of god and she has you know good principals and she is hungry to learn
in my ex husband you say
today puerto rico is so so the same weather every year but there your to to rainy moment and its very sunny moments throughout the year like
she lives close to here i live in aurora colorado and she lives about three miles from there
yes i see her three times a week every weekmore on other activities like today for example well
we share together with her
yes that is good
no absolutly
well it was invaded by americans in eighteen thousand and ninety eight
they took away from the spanish from there they established american governors and from there they dominated until they started to goverhave puerto rican governors
like in nineteen fifty four they have puerto ricans citizenship
but puerto rico no not that long for example when my parents were born were not citizens but i have been a citizen my entire life
en then from then forward they started free commerce which is a free association with united states but without being a state
july can be very sunny and may well very rainy
overthere they vote on the primary they vote on the primary for the president from here but they do not vote in the president elections here
then in some way it is independent in some way has lots
in dependent or union with united states would be very difficult because puerto rico would beecame a totally independent country because
they would have to approve first there but they have never approved and never been approved
good evening mildred of connecticut
mhm
what type of music do you listen to
rock and all that ah
reaggeton and all that
ah
yes i do i listen to everything reggaeton rap everything
rock i don't like it that much but i do listen to it i can't listen to it for a long time just a bit i can spend a whole night listening to rock music no
i'm not a rocker
i do like bachata merengue salsa everything classical music
romantic music nice yes i think that music lets you know a bit about other cultures it helps get to know people from other countries
mildred
and
aha aha
i think that it is helping bringing people together even if they are from many different nations mexican people like salsa some others that are from
different countries like salsa too merengue bachata and when you go to dances well
there
are people from many different countries dancing
i like it i like mexican music because it has a good rythm i like ranchera music i love it yes
i like them a lot
yes aha
yes very beautiful very beautiful and the chinese also the chinese music
where are you from arturo
yes especially o if someone knew how to interpret well it would be more beautiful because they always present like a history when they do presentations of them with the women that are moving their hands
yes and those fans
they use it like in order to tell a story
we are brought to old times with the natives doing their
their dances and everything and the slaves were the first that used music in order to complain in order to be able to say
the evil with which they were treated they were expressing all of their
their discontent
i believe that music will always continue for centuries and centuries you know
even though its different in the type that they choose it will always unite the people because wherever you go you hear reggaeton and already you know who it was and sometimes
i don't know if you remember that japanese band the band of light
oh okay and we talked or not
that they began to play salsa
yes and they were japanese and spent a lot of time here and i didn't know that they would last but they played a lot in new york and they didn't have discos when they originally played
the same salsa discos that they did in japanese music
or they would be safe that if a japanese came here to america they would say o well he is dancing
they can say it although they don't understand
mhm i already think that it's pretty and relaxing music
one of it's uses is to relax
i have discos while going out in puerto rico with the music that came that was recorded in rio
its one to relax to
when you want to be quiet at home you can light those scented candles and relax that helps a lot
forgive me
mmm ok and you need music you need music because it is what maybe if we had music people would be like a
even a little more aggressive too
because music calms you down
aha
um
oh
yes almost always how do you say it they extradite him from the country they they vote them
yes because it was protest music they called it true
in puerto rico they had topo the topo and who else sang that kind of protest music juan manuel sang protest songs and sometimes made concerts
but like they sang the truth about villages
yes
against the government and all that they are the
they try to to make people not go to those kinds of things
but its interesting because they make history
mhm yeah i think that same thing i think that
like they they they need music
they tell love stories disgraces people problem
daily life has many uses
yeah yeah i think that i love music i think that when i put it on i clean the house faster
no i mean i've always liked the piano and my daughters like piano classes i never had the opportunity of my mom paying for piano classes for me
i like playing the guitar and the violin
puerto rican mhm
the violin is is an instrument that i don't know so much about but it has precise music
yeah the violin is good you know what i like as well accordion music i live it as well
ha yeah but in puerto rico people we call it'gicaro' of land when they go out for christmas and all that
but you dontp lay an instrument
my boyfriend plays it my boyfriend plays base but he used to not anymore hes older now
but
he played with bands and groups he played the base
hmm
i see it relaxes you
i see that is good
today is the music
that is good i lea here we have a lot
because he he does dj
is does dj so there is music around the whole house
and every is all the time on the internet recording records and
and we make records for for people if they want
sometimes we have done parties and we do is that he records a cd full of songs and we give it to the person as a gift
aha
ahhhh
do you like it
hello how are you what is your name
you touch an instrument or
well i like it all eh music jazz i like a bit of classical music i listen to contemporary music alternative and fusion music like
it's like a merger of jazz with funk
a bit of everything what do you listen to
no do you like reggaeton
do you like reggaeton
yes sure
oh i'm i do like rock
yes
yes yes but
mildred i'm arturo
lately i think that is being forgotten nowadays music is mainstream like hiphop now i mean everyone is making the same music
in the united states in mexico they are they are just copying it they are using as a i mean it's become like a global gender
everybody i've listened to it i think i don't really like it but it is impressive that everybody is now listening to hiphop
in the music i think it's like reggaeton it's becoming popular
in mexico mexican music uses lots of hiphop and there are lots of rock bands that use hiphop or stuff like that
yes
yes yes
yes i do enjoy dancing merengue and salsa music too
yes
yes rancheras
i'm from mexico but right now i'm in philadelphia
yes they are good i do like them too but sometimes i don't know they tunes it's interesting to get to know music from other countries like
have you ever listened to arab or turkish music
interestingly it's good too
yes yes
yes yes yes yes
yes good well everyone since they tell something with music also the music has no lyrics so also they are painting an image or something like
this a scenery having lyrics always makes it related to feeling or story or the mexican music like the corridos
they are very well know because they tell stories of different people and of different things that have happened but they are very singular stories very good sometimes
yes
yes
maybe that's it
ah
yes yes yes
clearly
yes already
i see
no no if
oh japanese
no i've never heard them
i see
yes yes me too
i think if i did not where are you of puerto rico
it's very relaxing for distractions
ah
yes
aha yes like pure ambient sounds or that are
yes no well it is that music is
also even music that is very eh this aggressive helps to relieve no also music can be very important also like for liberation like
there is a singer whose music is called afro bit his name is cela kuti and this gentleman well in he for the civil war of of of nigeria
he was very important because him with all his music he made revolutionary movements i mean people didn't didn't didn't see him as a musician but rather as a political leader
that that through the music he moved people then when he released new albums
the the military was infuriated and some times he i mean he had the entire community like practicing with him who had the same political philosophy
eh if you talk
and all of them lived together in communities and when he released an album called zombie that criticized the army because they were like a puppet of the government that was
like killing people of their own race
he said everything in his song and the military heard it and
yes yes they threw him away he well they jailed him and beat him and burned his whole house and all the
exactly the music
ha yes of course
yes that it
people that make a riot out of everything and the government doesn't like that
yes
yes of course it gets involved in history as well music will always reflect what other people are living in the moment and what they think
i play that you speak of i do not agree that all i remember now is the music
yeah that's good
yeah always
yes
yes yes everything mh yes yes yes i think its necessary that we need air to live
and if you don't play music you dont play an intrusment
yeah
oh the violin
yeah not that much i had a friend at school that knew how to play the violin really good
yea but like you said mexican music uses a lot of accordions
yeah yeah yeah
yes it is very good music right
an i play the guitar base and i try playing the piano but its too hard i cant
so i just left it there
ha
yeah
its always good to play music i think
also that serves on to let it off one's chest whe when i want to get distracted or something since i take my bass and i play a little and
it distracts me if it relaxes me
yes
hmm
oh
a lot
oh okay
yes
aha
yes
to father is my uncle does something very similar as well he ehm he also it was like dj
but now he had not work so much he is with othe jobs but but he also record
good evening i'm joe
good good growing becoming very pretty and sweet
hey you have
sorry continue
oh i remember that
yes
yes crime could happen anywhere
it is sad that one
and don't be so trusting with certain people strangers specially
i always teach my daughter to don't be trusting with strangers and be very careful
you start to teach them they don't have to knock here or there
yes
right so really that small she tells me that when asks me that when she can have a boyfriend i say allot of time will pass until that can happen
yes more or less could be
what speaking of tonight's topic
right denver is a city pretty big but then nos
i live in aurora that is nearby denver
it's a city too pretty big but it doesn't have tall buildings like denver
i wouldn't say that is more quiet i would say
because it has a mixture of all
good people bad ones every ethnic group you have high crimes around too and you seem to live a little fear
how are you cristina
then yes i lived in home before no i live in an apartment and i found some nasty situations around here
including gun shots and things like that
well if i could go i would go to a calmer place a small village rather than a city
because i am tired of the city i drive here every day and the traffic in denver is horrible
too many cars and where my girl goes school it takes me a long time and i'm sometimes waiting for about an hour and half just driving before going to work
yah its a little bit and when you arrive to work you're all stressed out
with a big headache yes
yes
what is it a village
yes
i'm from puerto rico but i live here in denver colorado
yes over there yes
yes
yes
yes
and how is the crime and things like that
oh how cool
ah that doesn't happen here in aurora
they're not about crimes nor any of that
wow what what what most delicious thing
well i'm going over there then to be your neighbors
oh very long i've been here like twentysix years
it's all the opposite of denver
and aurora aurora
yes
no people in colorado too eh mm eh here mm we like going to the mountains a lot camping all that
well there are people everywhere and
many places that who have come these people they have brought many bad habits too
then well things happen that they make you live in fear
with my daughter i am always in fear because there is a lot of talk on the news of what happens a crime in aurora
what yes shots that they stole this that they ran over a kid and the the driver of the car is on the flight
things like that
yes and you
sorry
yes
the cars you can't leave you car the cds
in the car or things like that because they break the windows to steal them
the cds and
i never leave anything flashy in the car
ah that's good i dream of a place like that the only problem is
i have a divorced father i have a daughter
and she and i i mean my exwife we share custody
yes i i would never leave my girl behind i want to stay near her until she grows up
ten years where are you from
and one day she'll get married and forget about me i hope not but i know that's what happens most of the time
well it happens a lot
but nothing i would like to live in a more quiet place my brother lives in kansas
and it is very quiet there also
they have festivals people are more quiet no
yes here there many beautiful things not everything here is is ugly or anything like that but
it is that since there are people living and more people moving and the and and the city i mean there are cities in colorado that are more the ones growing the most of all america
in eh that also has its problems
yes
yes
haven't i talked to you the other nights
no here you have the apposite here they have
yes
yes
and it's right you have lots of relaxing parts and there it has lots of family attractions
for adults for singles everything in reality you have all that right here we i work it's a hightech company area of
then too you have an amphitheater too one block from my work and sometimes we hear the concerts while working
from the building
yes and no here you don't miss that the activities the only thing es particularly in the city i live you have lots of crimes i would like
you have parts of of right here border areas too that are fairly quiet and
with good neighbors even though there are lots of people they care each other pretty well and like you say they have their cars open without fear of robbery and stuff like that
yes i think so you have your family your husband your children
in this which is as a limit to it is a mixture of good and bad
understand and the bad ones well they are the ones who like to take advantage
and you live well in fear and calm
but traffic is horrible let me tell you
it is it is really horrible because sometimes taxi drivers and on winter days it is still worse because when there start to be all these accidents and you can not move on the highway
it is terrible
but i always dream like that with a quiet place some day i think that whatever it is going to be possible in in
she lives very close like at one not even two miles of distance from here
in what was my home mm and also to the home of my exwife which was my house then they came in also one time they came in through the
the because the house has three levels
yes a fiveyearold girl
and the basement its like isn't an basement what did it stay up the windows
then they get in for the back and the basement i mean the below of the house and steal a lot of things of it
no she had been gone with some coworker i went to the house and inspected and gave her my recomendations that she will have to lock this and that because
it doesn't let it exposed to the thiefs right
then she did it like that also in her car in her workplace where she is parking is not a very good place they have get in her car about three times
three times they have broken her windows took her cds they had rob her stereo
yes that's the bad thing of live in the city you have any kind of atracctions but there is much
desadvantages
i missed
exactly
good evening cristina from idaho
you're going to ha going to have to be careful with the boys huh
they relax and everything else
and
oh for example when that happened the news here were that this man came and killed his family and he took away two kids
yes because precisely they are living here in the field and the children you never know that somebody like that can come over here
and
sure
and you have to be careful always
sure so
yes but you realize until it when you have kids then you start to worry that's terrible
sure when you have kids at least you can take care yourself but
like at twenty five years right
when you daughters not any more
y com
yes how's there how is where do you live it's a big city in the city or live outside
ah
aha
ah and a little more quiet
ah
hmm
hmm
good where are you from
ah yeah
oh and would you like to live what kind of place would you like living in
oh
yeah
wow
a headache
that's a big difference its super calm here
really really calm
well idaho yeah in general idaho is mainly land i would say
i man the biggest city boyce
ah for how many years
but its a relaxed city and it kind of small
and that is the biggest city after the one that follows i would say is idaho idaho falls but i consider that it is like a big town
because it's not a city city and but it's it's like there are no big buildings or things like that or buildings really
and but uh so there is it's like what is here it's a big town but mm
oh nothing happens here people live leave the doors open the cars unlocked
and
of course it's very very peaceful no dad look the daily news here uh talk of ah someone lost something i mean the news no nothing no nothing happens if
if something did happen it would be the news of the
of course of the month no nothing absolutely nothing
sometimes too quiet
oh
yes it's super peaceful and people a lot of people live in the countryside so they live it's it's it's peaceful super super peaceful
eh yes
as i tell you it is too too quiet there and there is not much to do i mean here the people who live here they like things outdoors like
camping and fishing and going to the mountains to ski and
of course well
of course
of course
of course
of course
of course
i've spent ten years in
like like city city then
we i used to live when i used to live in chile i lived in santiago for a while it's the capital
and sure it's different to live in a city i mean you can't leave your doors open you can't can't trust no one usually and
sure
everything
yes that doesn't happen everyone but
sure no it's quite safe in here for me it's too quiet for me but it's okay because i have kids now so it's a good place to raise kids
that's why
sure
you have to be close to
from chile
sure
yes
aha
of course no
a little more relaxed
of course
of course
yes and that is what i miss because here there is a lot to do besides the things you do outdoors there is no opera here there is not eh places to
the mall is very small there are no places to visit or places ballet or concerts and things like that those things are not around here
then one the city you know as i tell you pulsy or city that are in utah
i think so it sounds your voice sounds familiar
and and if you like to do things like that go to concert or go to see you know an opera theatre or anything like that a show
no there is not you have to drive like four hours three hours to to see something like that nothing happens here the only thing the universities here have those tiny shows and things like that but
you miss that from from the city no that
that you can find that type of fun stuff but at the same time there is
ah with all the tranquility and other i liked that allot when we lived in utah
ah in the city you have all that you want
and it's quiet
right
aha
right
yes you have a little girl right
yes you see i would like to live near things like that that have activities and stuff
hmm
of course
of course
of course
of course
well yes i don't really miss
ah snow and ice and all that ah
oh yes that is not at all strange
well yes because when already the when already and where your daughter lives she lives very close too no
ah yes yes i remember how is your daughter
ah
aha
ok
oh werent they in the house did they
sure
oh that's makes me angry
that's make me angry
sure you have to
you have to be careful
sure here you relax and that's the problem because there are somebody who comes from other place that take advantage of the circunstances the people trust too much
hello good afternoon
and well the weather outside i'd tell you that i haven't got used to it yet it gets me down
i swear in the morning i turn the window and get get angry ay not again
ah i'm in the highrises yeah
yes where
no no no i lived before coming here i lived in singapore for 2 years and before that it was ciudad de mexico all my life
yes
yes well yes i've getting used to to tropics
then it's tropical nothing else then
yes i came and it was like today what's going on
yes
maira habla
and in the air it rains for a week i don't understand how they can survive this time
yes
yes yes yeswhat happens is that the cold if you can stand let's say until december christmas is gone and after when what happens is that
when you return you think well christmas is overand say the cold is finish
the cold is for christmas and you return and is worse then it is when it really hits and leaves me like knocked
yes yes please

yeah
ah
ouch poor guy
oh
ouch poor guy
he brought it on himself
oh
what grade is your brother in
ah ok
who are you
that's fine
about what about the crime wave
i have not heard much about it here in philly or rather i have heard that were some persons who are rob on forty first or whatever
but i think that i have always been lucky because i have been walking at night alone on forty first and like going to the store
to the fruit shops on forty eighth and i go there whenever and nothing has ever happened to me
yes additionally by myself as happy as ever with my life besides not even i don't even think about it not even paying attention i don't walk around in fear or anything like that
and nothing has ever happened to me i have no reason to be scared of anything to the contrary once i get there they are all super friendly
then i don't know i think that
i think i'm lucky because is the same in mexico in other words all my friends in mexico have a story about been rob or kidnapped or something that they have done to them
and nothing has ever happened to me i am always alone at late hours of the night in bad areas so and so all those things they say you shouldn't do
ah again
i've done all of them at the same time and nothing has happened to me
yes it's like trust me that i see what has been done yes i remember what i have done and i say to myself  how did i dare to do that
what was i thinking wow i was a very irresponsible teenager but you know nothing happened to me
so i don't know i don't feel insecure i have lots of reasons but you do have you met philly
ah yes what's it like
aha
yes
yes we do too
yes yes they have lots of them
ok
how are you
yes
yes in general my in philadelphia there are a few zones were i'm wouldn't go
i don't like it i mean like at night like in the center city there are a few places where i dont like walking too
but i don't know i dont really know the city well i dont know the people here
i mean in mexico i would see someone and then cross the street or not
and here its like i don't know its like i'm scared about something or someone
well no no no
yes
uhum
yes me too
very good how is everything going how are classes
but why don't you know anyone in philadelphia that knows history about robberies
uhum ok
uhum
yes also
of course also they are in a lot and neither is it that much more expensive that happens if you are walking alone or in
the fortythird that is how it always happens like that since yes they can not do that either no
yes it is very calm
do not worry about anything
yes and there is not light
and no light
good
on the blocks
uhum
yes
me good everything's going good with this i just got done with all the exams and well you see that i'm in that week where at least you can can't really do anything
hello good afternoon what
oh no
no but but where are you from or where do you live
eh before coming here
be before coming here to study
ah then that's it
it's very hot or it's hotter here
it's very hot in singapur right
yes
ah and then here it's cold and
eh
ah maira ah how are you it's jose
no there's cold and yes there's no sunlight ah after the summer it feels nice but a a week like that a little cold
so uh ah not a lot i like that but ah yes it is only the beginning right of a terrible winter
then but that is what i don't like but
uhum
ah
yes i know my brother studies in cornellwhich is farther north about six hours from philadelphia but is
much further north
and it is so cold that classes don't start until the end of january until maybe the 28th of january
yes yes he says that it is so cold that it is better to spend more days in may than to spend the days in january right the students because
they are the cold in cornell is brutal the cold in philadelphia can be endured right the cold in cornell is too much
hello um
and my brother
really and my brother well he was lucky enough to get a what they call a town house
but it was a lot bigger then you went in and they had a little living room and a kitchen and then you went up and they had all the rooms but
it was pretty big but the problem is they were some of the university's new dormitories
and they had built it in in uh in the university's outskirts so it was pretty far from the university and his classes
were engineering classes that were held at the other side of the university
and i say that he's i mean right then i say there's there's a bus system there like
public transportation there why don't you use it no i don't want to pay the fifty dollars do you understand
right then he he spend the whole semester walking and during the winter it was like twenty degrees and he walked he walked forty minutes to get to class
ouch my brother
jose
no it's
because it's he's just cheap right he didn't want to pay the fifty dollars so i said i that's ridiculous so i said
no because the bus only stops four times every hour so he doesn't want to wait fifteen minutes something like that
i mean my brother i don't know
no but um now he is in the eight grade
yes yes but
and and what do you think about the crime wave here in philadelphia
eh the crime wave yes
uhum
and you walk to forty eighth
yes again
oh
yes yes
uhum uhum
the
eh
mm good i don't to me
to me it's like it's the same old story right nothing has happened to me either so sure i think i live in
here close to the university i live in walnut the thirty eight between the thirty eight and the thirty nine
so it's not that far away and there are lots of police here so in general i haven't me anyone that has gone through that so i really think that
sure it does happen right i read it in the paper and
good and you
i think that in general it's kind of weird because in around here we have so much security there are lots of cameras
and lights and they have some phones well people or the the cops they have byke it's unbelievable they have
they spend lots of money in that but in general they are keeping us safe
and i imagine that that the people from the neighborhood for example criminals right know that that they have to be careful with the security in this area
and i think that they can um mm to the people that do crimes so i don't know in general its very safe
in the quad because before that it was security no no it wasn't so strict because one had to pass there and one gave the card to someone else
and then they would go get him whats his name the system to see if one was actually a student from there or not
that they didn't make an illegal copy of it right but now
the thing is that people could have gone in and out like nothing but they now have those systems those new doors that
you cant do anything at all right so in general they don't worry about someone in the university
ah well good studying here a a little but and well they called me and i say well why not why not rest a little bit right
um
yes
no um
yes
uhum
yes yes
well philadelphia has lots of neighborhood that are dangerous because
they have they are they have secure neighborhoods right so one has too from the university that is also in general secure but
yes one goes north north philly all that then south philly and west philly its not necessary
so it really gets dangerous so it does for example if one wants to go out at night they wont go to north philly so its not that
and how are you how are your classes
important right
well for us
yes why yes if one goes out one goes to philadelphia but that's an old city so they have cops and everything
so
yes um in general there aren't really many students in the old city the majority of the students stay in the university
i think um yeah in general but people complain too much that there's no security because we live in a bad neighborhood
but in general i mean there is every week one read the the the so there is once a
there was a robbery or something so one goes and naturally thinks whats happening right but
in reality its im one thinks that they will get jumped or will jump two hundred students but there's twenty thousand students so the probability is that
that that happens to one
uhum uhum
of course it exists right but is not that that tall
yes yes
yes yes yes but that also seems to me me that it is better to live like that in like something like univeristy highrises because no especiall if one returns over there in at in the night and
is that is ehm yes well it is nice to have to
to walk for a long time the people that live like that in baltimore but the squares in baltimore are huge they must over there that
yes huge uhm
there is no light there is no light
yes there is no light yes and but in highrises it is better more calms one does not have to buy uhm all of the furniture
ehm if something happens one calls the university and they take care of them
but and and one has to to also there are a lot i've heard a lot of stories like of problems between people that that share an apartment
hi
i am in the linguistics program
hmmm hmmm
hmmm
sure
no that is i know people who wear it and i know the ldc and what they do
but no
well the ldc what they do is collect many types of linguistic data whether that's text like it might be tex um something spoken and then it can be used for for many things for for example
uh programs that that can understand voice nee need training they don't need
a sample let's say
and it then um for example for this it's possible and and for studies of for example how people pronounce the letter this way up to the dialog how it develops i don't know what or for
for many things and the ldc they do this they collect data for many languages and and then the people
can do more things more applications or more studies more theories right
mhmm yes yes
hi i am olaya in philadelphia
well i live in in west philly but well not very west let's say i live at fortythird and spruce
no no too much west
and aha aha
mhm
mhm mhm
well i like it allot like before i come here
they told me good that philadelphia was little dangeous and such and
caution with west philly including the guide that spread in the campus they say it's dangerous go out at night
right this is my second year now
and i trully i didn't see nothing and no bad things happened to me i don't feel unsafe either in general could be that
are you spanish
don't know because i watch few things the news around here they scare you a bit
and i don't know i say nothing bad happened to me ever and i would say i feel safe i don't feel like being in danger but i know people that do feel like that they get scared about west philly and
yes but right mm
that is that is his problem no like i don't know
mhm mhm
yes mhm mhm that too
like tell me tell me
mhm
mhm
yes
ah okay okay very well nice to meet you and from where are you calling
mhm mhm mhm
no let's see it's true that things happen i do i do know a girl that that was attacked no
and but those things happen in every city i don't know
and in every city there are there are crimes and and i don't know but i do believe that here
they give it much attention and it's repeated a lot no and it shows up on tv and in the newspapers and then it ends up creating a state of a bit collective of
of psychosis no and
yes
mhm mhm
mhm and west philly i don't know i think it's a neighborhood very it doesn't have very nice areas but it has some very nice areas and and very nice to stroll around
and i don't know there are people that live in center city that never used to happen no to come to have a stroll around here
also good
and and i don't know i think that it's a nice neighborhood to tell you the truth
mhm
yeah yeah yeah mhm
yes
mm i for once went traveling to sesenta street or something like that i kept going then i left
i wanted too see what was going on and
and then i found a neighborhood a poor neighborhood it was ugly a few houses were old or not taken care off i mean
you could see it was poor in a few places
but but there wasn't anything disgusting or something scary i don't know you could have seen
well well that's the income for those kinds of neighborhoods less than others
right now i am studying
and and of course there aren't any white people on the streets
those are the things that have surprised me the most about philadelphia no the the division so large that there is still
yes hmm
hmm hmm yes really and sometimes it is curious mm i mm ahm i take the bus here here in front of my house and sometimes when i get on the bus well everybody is black and the the bus goes like changing colors no as it continues advancing
that advan that you go eastbound and when you go westbound is the opposite it is one thing
yes yes yes it is strange
sure sure it is a is a relationship with social class no more more than something racial it is clear yes
where you from m from mexico
they say that it is dangerous no or that it is
hmm
at upenn the university
ok mmh pe
mmh mmh mmh
mmh mmh
wow
aha aha aha
that i had also heard i mean kidnappings like that
ok ok ok ok
wow
mmh
mmh mmh
yes what do you do
mhm
and people didn't do it before no no were afraid to report
hm
yeah yeah yeah mhm
mm mm
mm mm
mm
mhm
mm
wow mhm mhm
ah
wow impressive
mhm mhm
mhm mhm and no
i don't know how is in mexico but looks to me the tv i mean
causes the fear right because news are like very local and very
each robbery they explain it in different ways and then they explain it again and again
actually
yes yes yes yes
and
ok
hi who am i talking to
ah okay do you have something to do with this program
but yes yes
well yes in mexico no that much because it is very excessive that
practically impossible to include every robbery or every
every uhm rape or every i don't know
every mugging there is know what i mean then it's just the ones that are really really big that is when there's a kidnapping
very drastic kidnappings or when it's like the the case of the juarez deaths that are
ah okay
and p and p and or how final are they making this program or what is
a
oh okay oh
okay okay
uh huh wow
aha
more specialized
wow okay oh and this where you live here in philadelphia in what neighborhood or
olaya i am arthur
oh okay well yes that is that is not not that west like you say
yes yes i live in campus
but i live high 40th floor
in the skyscrapers
and how do you feel the air living so high at 43th
yes
yes
aha
mhm
yes that too
eh no i am from mexico
yes the people the black people no there are lots of them that gets intimidated by the black people here
eh to me
yes right no but like how allot of people associates west philly with then the neighborhood like it were a ghetto no how
the the neighborhood of the black and then unsafe
but
like i i don't feel to intimidated and all that because i have a friend who live near fortyfive
and i walk over there frequently and at night too and all
and i meet allot of people too there sometime at night because i have to cross the the park
and that and there are lots of people there too at night then at two in the morning they are rumbling there and then they
never threatened me not even like they never ask for a cigarette and something like that then yeah
from philadelphia as well in fact yes
no like in truly no i don't see them provoking there like
ah ok
yes all yes yes yes
yes aha
yes yes
yes i think it's as you say like it's exaggerated so people on their own make
like the the the idea that it's very unsafe but in truth no it's not so much i mean it's more the idealization like of what they are thinking
they are making it more serious than it truly is
yes yes
that no
what do you do in philadelphia work or study
yes i don't i don't dislike it at all
i mean its not particularly pretty or nothing but i mean its like you say there's some good places to walk a bit and
and well living here as a university student well um um everyone lives here so at the same time you don't want to be too far away from here because then you get disconnected from the university place and students
me too i think
that's why the people that live in universities find it comforting
oh yeah
and what did you find
ha
yes
yeah right
ah okay
they make a lot less yes
yes yes yes
yes is that what an impressing displacement that is
that is to yes it is impressing to see that like the more you go to the the west well more black people you start to have and every time there are less whites
yes yes yes
yes yes yes it is true i have used the bus just one time but but i do recall as well of getting on and then then noticing that
everybody was black when iwas going to the eas to the west
yes but well that that too well it is like as a result of that i mean the fact that the majority of the of the black people here well is is of the lesser income then well
sure yes more than anything it is simply just that but
from the city from mexico city
ah me too
yes yes over there over there is a lot more serious the the ehm the issue that is it is not as bad as here that that ehm that is over there yes seriously
and especially there continues to be like a lot of segregation ehm of of social classes and is is very evident that is it is
i am from a i have like a an appearance that is much more this european let's say i am i am blond with white screen and light eyes
and if i walk through some neighborhood there in mexico kind of unsafe
be sure that i am not going to go out with a purse
or i mean but in i of of one hour i mean no it is not going to take long to catch me
and they might even kidnap me i mean it is more probable that they kidnap me
yes it is impressive now it is it is it is interesting because of the kidnappings who they kidnap i mean it is no longer because you are from a family
prominent one nothing whoever they take him in a care they take him and they call it express kidnapping then they they they take you and the take what they can i mean since a few
thousands of dollars unti if you have much more well you you have it but what you have i mean no longer people are
yes chemical engineer an undergraduate
like very desperate the that they do they do brutal things the truth and it is
it is terrible but well this but well the truth i mean in the end also there has been too much social conscience regarding the the citizens this now they are starting let's say to oppose that you understand me then
people testify the the the attacks people now do oppose
i mean there have been much more much more involvement because before if was like well nobody
yes because yes right and because the truth also the the security system was hardly didn't work so someone declares a crime and
it was a lot of paperwork that i don't knowthat didn't work
but then lately you have been well let's say a little bit more well reaffirming the action of the policemen and things like that and trying to
to catch more thieves and kidnappers and much more with that so people feel that there's more response to all that
before those reports
before it was not so much but even then and also for example there was a march in in mexico a couple of years ago
and you
about one and half years ago that was called the silent march for the security of mexico where everybody walked to to
to the city zocalo
and there were millions of people it was crowded
i mean you can see them everyone dressed in white and everyone in the streets
then you can realize that is real something socially needed i mean people is already
much more attention to the security
anything else
yes
yes yes yes yes
yes too much sensationalism let's say right
i see it's javier
i mean they can make your description and
would be good
and have you ever had any problems with having to go to court or that
yes
they can that could happen too but but i don't know they say that that that i mean it's optional if you they send you a letter
eh is it optional or mandatory i'm nos sure really
aha
oh
sure it's
oh yes it's like a friend of mine got a letter like that but he's working from six in the morning to four in the afternoon so no he said he
eh the manager of his company said he was someone who was not able to to skip work no
exactly
well yes yes yes but i don't know i mean sometimes i think it would be fine to attend mostly in cases such as
hello how are you eh this eh i think this is good i've never served as a jury but i'd like to do it someday i don't know if you
rapes of boys and girls
yes you can serve as a jury and and and yes how's that if you can tell the person is or if the person is guilty and
you can help so that justice is served quickly so i think it will be good to serve on a jury
ah
today i cried
oh i see i see you wouldn't be able to stand it i mean if it's really horrible stuff
that you ah where were you sent the in which state
oh you are living in canada oh
i'm here in new york
yes but ah i was trying to tell you about a friend of mine he's in arizona because i used to live in arizona and
ah did you
and then or hey do they have the same system in canada
oh you see mm oh that's good that's good well
i don't know how to tell you this if the day is mine well eh yes yes outside but but how you say we have to be careful no
oh or so you no eh
to the but i i imagine that it should be a meeting or a section to say explain the case
you are already involved you already decided this
oh there there there there
no too late
how when was it your name right
petty oh sessy or jessy
ah no eh you know i've heard that it's quite hard because it causes lots of trouble
oh besy oh
javier yes yes yes
oh are you living in canadá the how long
15 years wow
how can you resist the cold
i see
yes
i see
oh
oh
because i mean maybe you have problems i don't know you have to i think they have like your record your info about courts it's safer that way i don't know
oh i see and in in what state that provinces or states
oh vancouver i see is not around of washington state
already yes no oh yes know that i had plans to go to vancouver because ther were some friends from bolivia
but i lost the trail with them and i couldn't go because they say to me that the life of there is very calm i am not sure if this is true
oh
yes
ah
yes ah
oh were are you origininally from
oh yes i see i am from ecuador
i see
yes because you have a bit an accent as el salvador and even some day i'll see if i can go there because i tell you here
here much like like the justice theme no here sometimes like no no things aren't good
and and his and his how
yes tell me
aha
what here in the united states
ofcourse yes yes they give you the chamber penalty of gas you know
ya
oh ya yes yes yes yes
ya
yes yes
ofcourse the the the mistreatmentor the bad step but imagine that okay a serial killer that killed someone and
and then the gas chamber they have to be punished yes or no a few years
yeah right um yes
mhm
yes well no
clearly you can deduce that
what he did i don't know why why oh why do the people that do that not
yeah but then as i say not
the people are crazy
and as i say here it's getting hard each time you listen to the comments that that canada had were more calm
um oh well a drug dealer or something
yes
oh the i don't know here medicare or something like that
yeah
yeah exactly
and over there
just that it's more fair
today that's great
hey and and what is the job market like here
what kind of any sort of eh construction
yeah
oh i see i see you are so right no well they can say she looks like this and
oh
yes yes
oh not because
because i was hearing that if that that that this country that canada needs a lot of people no
oh yes there there is a program on the internet that if you accumulate points as seventyfour points and one would
can go to work and the government helps all
yes
yes is
yes is that you can
i'm half interested in doing that right
alex ah besy
i see they can have friends bah let's say you say okay he's guilty so he can talk to his friends and say  go after this person and kill his children or his
yeah
okay
me no
aha yes
mhm
aha
no well i got a letter that i said no but i sent a letter to from doctor
saying that i wasn't supposed to sit down for long periods of time because because i'm sick and i can't sit down that long i can't walk long periods of time nor be standing for long periods of time
so they said it was fine they said it was okay for me not to serve on a jury
that was last year so
ah i see i guess that he asked him for a letter
to be sent to the jury so that he
oh hello
mhm
so that yes but well i wouldn't want to be on one
because i cry a lot and
no it's because if something happens or is about the rape of a child or if they play a video it's something oh
oh no that's so terrible yes
ah no i live in canada
yes aha and you
oh aha
i see mhm oh
kind of i believe i don't know
ah no i got a letter last year
yea aja
yea we have to be careful yea de depends but they don't tell you of what of what type of case until you have arrived perhaps to where the judge or or to the
or where it has to be
it is when everything is is you said yes that you will do it
there jury duty
there and yes you said no then i don't want to do it then ah too late
there they said yes there
besy besy there
no besy con b
there aja and yours javier
but i to serve on a jury but i refused
now the mine is easy
15 years
yes yes
ah well this i live in a town before that the winter was really cold and had enough snow
fell enough snow
and then my husband and i decide moving to to the beach
in another province
and then here here the winter is like rain
and doesn't get cold
ajá is is a province is british columbia is around eh when i live is around to vancouver i don't know if you are going to the city ajá
mhm
already already more or less already already aja already
oh aha
oh now this a person with whom i spoke before told me you will live in a paradise and i say why
because there are several islands all around and the mar is very near and one can go to the united states
do you have a passport
you can go alone crossing the border
from here the border is about 10 minutes
yes washington already
el salvador
ah
i don't know i see i mean serving on a jury it's dangerous because it depends on which case you are serving
already
ya and hay
ah eh i'm sorry
no there is how do you say that let's say you kill someone and they give you the death penalty
eh is there is there in some state from there that
the death penalty ya
ya but i i was seeing something in the in the news the other day that this woman killed her three children
she put them in the water and the children drowned
and so my mother says no they should kill her drown her and i say better they put her in jail because she'll suffer more
the other people in jail know what she did and for that
i mean it's a a
o i say that they're going to eh piece i say
and of course something that will not cause suffering because if you kill one and
they suffered mm what ten minutes or whatever it was but but if they put him in jail the other prisoners ah
poor thing
that yes that people suffer i am saying
mhm there you go he's going to pay for what he did and
yes
what do you think people are crazy
mhm
now there something more calm yeah
if you get a murder case i mean or someone from the ah the that sells drugs the
because i imagine that the health care of the united states is not not as good or or like like um what do you call it
what do you call that that mm a a card that they give you for health care i don't know what it's called
yeah i medicare okay that's it
no it's not so great
or or is it
ah here it's i would say that it's good because
it's fairer yeah here it's more fair that
then over there
ya ah well they are looking for a lot of people to work construction
sure eh i think it's for constructing buildings or something like that
how do they call it the
yeah and they asked in other states
already but if you have experience doing so build buildings or houses or something
guess we can ask or visa or something i do not know
aha
at least in the province where i estou i uh um heard on the news yesterday that they were they needed people to
for this to work on construction
to where here
oh dever oh that i did not know
mmm
mmm
hello hello g hello hello
uh blacks and hispanics things like that they wanted to know
eh we all have one
yeah so it's like but i don't that such a simple thing like you know you are puertorican i am dominican
no no no oknow but
yeah but what kill me is that we're so close in proximity
dominicans republicans santo domingo are what like niety miles apart we're closer than florida and cuba
and we hate each other just because of where we were born what is that
exactly yea but i you know
hm mm
it just it makes me laugh i usually don't tell people until i'm asked but i never deny my race like people say something and i'll stand and be like oh hold up
hm mm
hmm
get out of here
oh thank you so much i speak spanish like a white person too
oh l let me find out ok that's another eh that's another thing that bothers me just because a person is um you what what does it mean to some white
you know what i'm saying what
hm mm
no absplease i'll tell everybody i don't care
hm mm
i see
no it's no it's not your fault it's not
your fault is not to is you know people act ignorant around me all the time and say stupid things like that and it's like
oy yes they always criticize they do it if you get married
yes yes you are if you marry a spanish girl
i i am uh my father is dominican
uhm both of them
yes ah good my husband is puerto rican too
then ah that was a problem too
with his family obviously they don't like dominican people too much
yes however when you look around the race doesn't count too much because my husband says that too if we got into details
hello yes no it's fine uh what is your name where are you from
of every family it could be a family situation
in my family there are a lot of professionals we're a lot more educated uh
unlucky in some economical things we are more stable economically however
the only reason they had to not like me was that the last girlfriend years before meeting me was puerto rican
and i'm from dominican partents born here raised here
yes
g
yes
yes
yes i can't understand the ignorance
ok my name is jennifer from new york
yes my sister in law is afro american she you know
how
uh eh manhattan
ohm ok so yeah that is theme for me no eh i get it a vi she was born here in in new york um
i get it and for me it's no so big always when both are happy
ah no i care less they are green or yellow uh pst
hmm
oh ok ok and then the funny thing is we're not all equal
because a have some family members of my own that i don't get along very well
and i i don't like them
ok so we are going to start this thing finish quickly
yeah
hmm
sí hm mm
yes but
but eh exactly it negate i love telling people i tell them in my professional life i talk with all kinds of people and what i say is
i talk where are you from i am dominican
what where from how can that be i believe it was you what does that have to do with
hm mm
aham
aham
ok so uh the subject was uh uh the interracial marriage
eh
hm mm
pe pst but this is
he is your friend but that is ignorance because
you know
yes
it is that no
exactly
that is he doesn't have that is i'm sorry that is ignorance
yea that eh
oh yeah that was that was today's subject so what do you think about interracial marriage
and still you you being you know that they have nothing to do with that
that that doesn't change at all because still
aha
mmhm
there's all classes in all the the races
and now because of this you have dominicans that love to multiply
have kids
yeah
yeah
uh but you know this
hm mm
uh yeah i feel like speaking english uh i can't we can't
but everything this is because the brother is a policeman here in manhattan
in my thirties and already a house um and he uh and i work with uh in inves uh like investigation but i work mostly with policemen
so in that
just a moment eh so i always say always oh where are you from then they talk to me for a while after i helped them dominican people say things in front of me
they said oh yes then blah blah blah they tell me oh where are you from uh dominican
eh oh
yes no
oh yes no
ok ok
ok well i
ok
yes because
the difference is that you can criticize a person and describe it like that dominican in that corner
ok but yea
yea exactly yes
you know them because unfortunately the the worse dominicans the ones that do all the things are always painted they have tattoos
they have a shirt they are
yes
oh yeah eh yeah yeah that also but we are not all like that is that that is funny thing because when i was in college that was oh where are you from
new york oh oh what what how what what ethnicity are you oh i'm dominican oh no
yes i also they ask what what we thought about uh if it is easier for certain races to get married like whites and the chinese
i don't think so
yeah oh no that one that one in unfortunately that's a a trait we all have but still its the point of
excuse me the point that um because we are or that we have that attribute
no no i don't mean that we are all the same
because i have cousins that make me ashamed because they're sluts basically
and no but no i understand but you know let's you go to to the heart of it
eh they are like that and have persons too
you know we are professionals and we do what we do and pitifully ok my grandmother had a nice bottom and we all inherited
but
no
hello sorry
i don't think that it is easier but it is more no no better because like a latin person with a latina well yes now it depends where you live where you live if you get married if i am a latino and i marry a black girl or something
and that's all starts like even in chatrooms in the computer checking out the chatrooms
and that's just like crazy the way that we're fighting
yea well the reason why i part asked you why you're from new york'cause
like what part of new york'cause you sound like like white
yeah you sound like white
but nothing nothing of course not now let the spanish come out
yeah like
like me when i told you i'm from the bronx i thought that they were going to hang up because i had three callers i told them i'm from the bronx and they hung up
they hang up on me
in in florida disneyworld
in lots of places probably lots of people will criticize
it was a line and we were standing a few excuse me'cause you had the line was moving but they weren't moving
and i had i said bronx new york and they oh honey come on they're from the bronx and they moved and they got off the line like
out embarrassed
i was like oh oh well
yeah
we are yes
yes but all the races what race you are
aha mother
both dominican fathers good i'm puerto rican
yes
with his
yes
yes
john eh from new york
yes
yes i
yes i have some dominican family
i have many cousins married to dominicans
and well they have dump they
divorced and else
and they have always been raised they are my family i have a lot of dominican friends
i have a family also my cousins have married to brown guys
yes where from new york are you
where from new york
and you oh
oh i'm in the bronx
yeah that's what i think too i think
yeah
yeah i me too i went out with mu mo girls of different tyoes
they're um don't know i don't care my first girlfriend was dominican
yes
yeah same as as me i have some friends ad they are dominican
but they say the are dominican they don't tell that around that they are dominican because they treat them bad
because that they are bit rude and all an he says i have and they don't because their family say that too
how how they call them sometimes rude and all that stuff and the are
yes what was um the topic did you hear it
they are quite um nasty
they themselves feel ashamed to see and i said that that does not need to make them feel ashamed because it is there in all races
yea i know one guy ok
no i know a guy who is a policeman i am a policeman right
and me he always he has tattos um with the puerto rico flag
and i always thought he was puerto rican until two or three weeks ago when we made a um a barbeque for no more than three weeks to say summer goodbye
he was talking there and the wife was talking there and something about him making a vow to the flag came up and i didn't know that and they said that he made the vows to the flag that he was not dominican and all that and he made
such um like when he made himself a citizen here
and he always said that he was puerto rican and all and changed his documents to tell that he is puerto rican
well he was not born here but he changed everything that the parents and all all that
oh ok because i didn't hear it well mine
yeah i said but why did you do it then he said because those people have not they don't talk to me he doesn't
he doesn't want to know anything dominica i say but i that is not like that because right now there are puerto ricans who don't want to know anything from puerto ricans but
for their life they say oh i am puerto rican
they never they never change i don't know why you should change it
and he well no i am i am an american puerto rican american and with that he doesn't
ah i i being dominican hey i am dominican because i can not change it
not like him who has been paying and paying to change everything so he says he is puerto ri and do and and from new new york
hm mm
yeah where where where i am working now
here in the bronx there are many dominicans there there's there are lots of puerto ricans but there are dominicans too
to me i don't care after that you are in love with someone
lots of people say  oh the dominicans are gross they don't know how to do anything there's a lot of there's a lot of dominicans
you could say there are more dominicans than whites
yes
yeah no and then the the puerto ricans don't say anything because the more come in like they say the more hispanics come more latinos the better
the little whites are the ones that have a lot of dominican and this one and this one and this one
this one puerto ricans want to grab oh all this here
so
i know well i'm getting up there too
yeah yeah
yea
yes marry whoever you want
yes
yes yohayo i speak like dominican like that
but in front of them and the puerto rican
talking is one thing talking but there are some who speak of them and they fall there until they get the point
because sometimes we are talking in a group look he is a dominican so dirty this and that but i am talking with the group
two or three dominicans with two or three puerto ricans
with whities we chat like this
but
yeah because when i watch people on the street that i know they are dominicans because they have a flag or something
i am dominican i came
no im i don't think i care nobody should care either
this way yes
yes like the
yes like women also
that from a distance for a reason
yes yeah
yeah yeah turn around
yeah
yea
yeah oh no no i didn't mean it that way i meant it with the back part
yeah
not i
yeah
right yeah but you know it's like that always it's like
so what if they are you know what sluts like you said
puertorican
dominicans hell yeah
like look at me my family with their own cousins and everything
i know that for a fact
yeah
yea
yea it's not even it's because like some like the dominicans say oh dominicans think they're better than us and puerto ricans think they're better than us like that
yes hello
ah yea
oh but they still call you or no
ah well they just they pay her just for twenty five right
yes to do it in english right
ah
ah yea um really i don't know i mean yea
it's it's it's pretty clear because the other time uh yes uh they had the the topic it was about m about religion
and they were like for fifteen or twenty days it was all all the same top ah the same topic
ah yea
ah
good night how are you
aha
right
aha
ah
of course of course of course mhm
yeah no i never saw it often because when
yes
mhm
yeah
yeah but it depends
david
not because they are always stressing the system because if you send them an email they answer you the next day very fast
yeah but ah with with me i i the other time i did it and it was over
and i don´t know what happened they didn´t call me again and didn´t have a phone number to call them or something like that but they sent me a check
you know about sixty days ago maybe two months ago and they sent me a check
until i forgot it i never knew
yeah that´s that´s true and do you live in philadelphia right
okay
oh because you live in the outskirts too don´t you
in school you guys go to penn state you said no
yeah yes
yes how are you

ah in two diffferent so
yes those that are and another thing like that no
where the wilds are no
over there oh
for mine it is the same
ha alright
oh okay
oh no i don't work i wish i could work i wish i could also go to school
but im
here at connecticut i think i already talk with you like a week ago
yeah some people don't think about it but when you're at school that's were you find friendship you dont have to go out to you know talk to your friends
not the whole world relies in the center in the same center you know
but then one is done and has to go home and has to pay the the costs of the house its really hard its better to stay at school
yeah you need to have an effort yeah
no no no
oh yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
yes sure
ehh yes
yes well it doesn't happens
yes it was cut off it was cut off the call no
no no your skills
in life when you go out to school everybody calm down you know they have family or married
you know they have children and the life is more harder no
yes so if you want to live the life like the americans i am going to tell you you know the american dream
the american dream you know they want to buy a house this and other
right
yeah
yeah
right yeah
yeah you are more more responsibilities in life
eh i don't know why it was cut off
but you know but and in life of being poor it is more difficult
the life of being poor has nothing to do nothing you know if you want o work you work if you don't want to work you maintain it
you know
yeah more or less same thing you know
for eh you have to get one one good woman that could help you who has who has a house or an apartment who helps you for this and that but
no but life is like this well no you know
live and learn
right
right no but e
you tell me the the large companies they are they are giving you stuff
howdy how are you
don't you see that that big companies they they give you cars no money down they give you the the stuff
yes
hi
there is a lot of people that i don't know is that there is so many calls that they haven't processed therefore it seems to me that they don't know how many valid calls
have every person therefore i don't know what they are going to do because already already are a to much people that by example my mother alredy have reach the twenty five calls
but she knows that there were several calls that didn't cut out so she doesn't know what to do right
yes they still call her i don't know a two weeks ago yesterday they were calling here but i think they still are i don't know but
i think so i think so but and uh yes it's just that in the end the thing is that it doesn't seem very well organized to me and it surprises me because
they've done that lots of times the the the ldc because they did it two years ago or a year and a half
but before yes it was uh well it was in english but they also had it in arabic and and spanish and whatever but yes yes e that's already an old story they've already done it lots of times so i don't know or least once
and that time well for several months so i don't know now because all of a sudden it's new again ah
no
ah i know no no no and and not just that the the recorder that was i think some some type of computer or something they had there uh
hi good night
and that that that that they tell her i that that's my theory that what they were saying was what they t t e they write the text in english for what they wanted the the for her to say
that that that you could hear it right
then they went to the autothis translator then they put the text there
from english to spanis and then there of of that they occupied a computer that that that made i don't know that ttthen there are computers or there are programs that do not
put put a lot of text then the computer the computer reads it
yes yes no no well well the translator it was something like this type i imagine
then what it talked about
i imagine that it was a it was a computer
then it didn't it didn't it didn't only have a bad accent but everything that it said it was for example when the calls ended it said
your time is above
fine who i'm talking to
yes no no no i didn't i didn't either well i i i never checked until until various times right that i heard it i didn't i didn't i didn't understand anything right
and then one time there i heard ah yes your time is above or for example one time what was it it had the the topic was  dating
then
the the translation in spanish was to date the it that way how do you like to date it things like that that are
incredible but obviously they have people who speak spanish right i don´t know
it has not be well very very very well organized
hmm hm shudong yes but the good thing is that they pay well at lastone is is a little bothering having to answer and
but not is not big deal there and they pay well
hmm
hmm
oh david it's joe or jo josé
mm hmm
ah a surprise
yes in philadelphia yes yes my mom lives in the outskirts i live here eh in in west philly in
at the university then
that that here cermm
no no university of pennsylvania yes no no yes it's different yes that all the world is confused by that because eh because penn state
is located in the center of the state
and it is a public university
and so am and so the university where i am it's the university of pennsylvania
yes exactly that is private and is located in the city it is completely different the other its much bigger and is public it is the countryside
oh fine fine and where do you live
ah
i don't know eh then i have never gone there i i don't know exactly where it is
but what what that it is in the center well maybe in the eighty one maybe possibly but but although the eighty one i think will be more
no possibly yes possibly yes because i know that the eighty one well i don't know better better i say nothing i
yes mi e e e yes yes all that i know of the eighty one is that because we used to live in tennessee
and northeast
so close to virginia we were living in virginia but then we moved to tennessee but then we found out that the eightyone passed through there but that's all i know
it seems like its long highway i don't know but yeah so you but are you finished or are you still studying what are you doing
mm oh okay
its a lot easier imagine
o oh yes yes yes how are you
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah that's good though the good thing about being in university is that when someone is done ones costs rise
a lot right so one has to buy a car and you want one then another so then one would have to start working right so that you could maintain yourself while a student just lives there
a little just a bit i don't know have you heard about ramon soups
no no no those soups that they sell raman soup costs like twenty cents
if one could live off of ramon soups it would only cost you twenty five cents to eat dinner but then again it isn't that way
you don't spend much less but it's a life more calm yes its calm but i think too that when the people remember when they were students forget everything else so in the workplace really
yes but its a life that has more freedom flexibility in time like by example if i want spend tonight
everynight awake then i don't know studying and i dont have class tomorrow i dont care really because i dont have or someday i dont want to go to class really
but in the work you cant say oh yeah i didn't want to go to work today
yes i don't know why
only that yes no no its very flexible
mmm
a lot harder
yeah yeah yeah the trouble is that i feel its that you have to be happy with what you have a that it seems what
a lot people not do because the income rise obviously the work responsibilities you have
but at the same time
everything that one consumes is one one goes to buy for a better car and one may do one thing and the other and then when one sees the money is gone right and one stays there it looks to me only with the responsibilities right
so i don't know right now i am happy as a student but for now right but eventually of course one has to save to buy a house but
i don't know that is scary to me having so many overheads right because it's that one works works and works
and one feels that one is not enjoying money right but also that in part is because one says well one doesn't think of all the benefits that it gives to one person right but also
oh yes i don't know what they are going to do with that because they have
one has a car to go to work right so one has to have this so that one has to cut the grass i don't know it seems a lot to me
a lot so fixed payments fixed responsibilities is i don't know
yes definitely
yes right
yes yes that is right
the wife maintains him
yes
yes yes
yes
yes no well n eh i think so that there is that there is it is because of that that one has to have like that i think be careful with with
so much calls that that had been cut off and it seems that also
how you spend money because it is very easy because for example yes if you buy a house then buy another and boy another i people don't understand anything and you feel that you don't are not going to enjoy money right
you have to be serious to see
what is more important right what what what is it that you like to do
and if not if it is not that then it is better not to spend money on that right
that is what it seems to me
