reactions of their past lives that we realize actions very negatives and now its from the negative reaction that they are suffering
reactions to past lives where one did a lot of negative actions and now it's a negative reaction that they're suffering
reactions of past lives that you are realized actions very negatives and now is a reaction negative that is suffering
past lives that had negative actions are not having negative reactions and suffering
no its not really that there aren't people that are very inocent or very good people its just a reaction like you have free will
it's not that really you don't have very innocent people or people who are really good that it's only the reaction like one has free will
really aren't persons that are very inocents or persons that are very good that only the reaction is when you have free will
not that there are no innocent people or no people who are very good only a reaction has free will
not to do what we wish god doesn't force us to believe in him doesnt force us to serve or do devotional service for that
not to do what you want god doesn't demand that we believe in him or that we serve him or to go to his devotional service because of this
not to do anything god doesn't force to believe in him to serve or to realize his devotional service for that
you can not do what you want god does not force you to believe in him or obligate you to serve or perform devotional service
we have our free will and if we do negative activities many times there is a reaction of the karma law for that nobody its free of the karma law its infalible
one doesn't use his free will and does negative things and many times this is a reaction to the law of karma for this law of karma of that no one is free of the law of karma it's unbreakable
you doesn't use the free will and do negative activities that a lot a times is that reaction to the law of karma for that the law of karma nobody frees of the law of karma is infallible
no one uses free will and does negative activities there is often a reaction to the law of karma if is infallible that no one is free from the law of karma

religion was lost during institucinalization well what a i mean with that is that religion ceased to be something spiritual
religion was lost during institutionalization i mean to say that religion stopped being something spiritual
the religion was lost during institutionalization what i mean by that is that religion wasn't left to be something spiritual
and became something more political and then lately now in the last times it has ceased to be so political but even so it still keeps bringing many of the ones that are
and turned into something more political and then lately it has ceased to be so political although it keeps carrying much of it
and became something more political and now recently in recent times it's stopped being so political but it has also brought a lot of those who
and converted into something more political and lately in our times isn't such a political force but it giving headaches too
like the institutions so you can be very religious and spiritual
like institutions so you can be very religious and spiritual
like the institutions therefore you can be very religious and spiritual
like institutions then you can be religious and spiritual

but not neccesarily institutionalist so maybe you do not need to agree what the church says o agree what
but not necessarily institutionalist so sometimes you don't necessarily have to be in favor of what the church says or in favor of what it says
but not necessarily institutionalized then you may not necessarily favor what church says or favors
some certain institution like the jewish one the catholic one or the muslim one but then maybe if you can here among the topics mix a bit of of the philosophies of all of them like
some institution like the jewish or catholic or islamic says but then may be you can as i said with other matters mix a little of the philosofy of all of them and
one certain institution like judaism catholicism or muslims but sometimes you can also like i said mix a little of or all philosophies so that
a certain institution like the jew catholic or the muslim but then perhaps like someone said you can mix a little of the philosophies like

with this god didn't need to be through this institution so i just decided to read a bit about other religions but merely
to get an interest and lets say practice life but
to cultivate myself and to practice a good way of life but
to cultivate myself and to let's say practice a good way of life but
to cultivate myself and to let's say get the right way through life but
but yeah i'm not i don't like the institutions
i don't like any i don't like the institutions
because if i'm not any i don't like the institutions

a divinity above all things no
a divinity behind everything no
sometimes well related to that it has changed so much in fact i study chemical engineering and sometimes people think that in science you tend to
but yeah i mean well based on that i've changed a lot and in fact i study chemical engineering and many times people think that sciences tend to uh
but yes or well based off that i have changed a lot and in fact i also study chemical engineering and many times the people believe the sciences
but i mean in base of that i had changed a lot and studied too i studied chemistry engineering a lot of time as people of sciencie you tend to
to brake religion to currupt it
let's say break people's religion corrupt it
say tear apart the peoples religion corrupts
we say broken the people religion or corrupt it
but think it's re opposite because people who starts studying this well this scientific things are normally really religious because
but i think the opposite because people who starts to know this well they're very scientific and stuff like that is normally very religious because
but i think the complete opposite because the people the begin to recognize the most scientific things and things normally are also very religious because
but i think all the contrary because the people begins to know of him so i am very scientific this things are very religious because
peruvian a my my my roommate is peruvian

when they start knowing themselves of about things they can explain
because the more they know the more they learn and they can explain
because they began to realize that the more the get to know the more they can explain
because they give realize that with that more you know and can explain
more questions arrive and you understand that the world is not understandable there are miracle things all over the place and time
the more questions arrive and and the more the world discovers this is unexplainable and there are miraculous things all the time and everywhere and
more questions arise and and more discover that the world is unexplainable and that there are such things as miracles all the time and that they are everywhere
more questions you get and more you discover of this inexplicable world and there are miracle things in every place every time and this
i feel that each time when people knows like scientist do and those people understands that there must be a supreme chaos and a divinity behind everything
i feel that every time the more people know how those scientists and those people understands more that there must be a divine chaos a a divinity behind everything
i feel that every time the more the people know how the scientist and those people understand more that there has to be something divine a a divinity behind it all
i am sorry each time the people knows more like scientifics and that people understand more must be a divine caos a divinity behind everything
yes

yeah exactly you don't turn to religion only to ask for help but also to thank
yes that's right you just don't ask for help in a religion but you thank it
yes exactly not only you have to turn to religion to ask for help but also to thank
yes exactly one does not need to turn to religion to seek help but also to say thanks
i think that many times people become religious at certain times because they need help but once they're ok they forget
i think that people start being religious in certain moments because they need help but once they're ok they're over it
i believe that also many times people well they become religious in certain moments because they need help but when they are already well they forget that
i think that many times people then becomes religious on certain moments because they need help but when they already that they are fine that is forgotten by them

all all all and then is very easy then for example the directories for example i imagine hotmail directory too
yes all all all and then it is very easy that for example the boards for example the board of hotmail i imagine there also
to everything so it's very easy that for instance the directories for example the directory of hotmail i imagine there too as well
they look for names and look and then they create a huge list
search for names and search and then create a huge list
they look for names and they look and then they created an enourmous list
they look for names and look so they make a huge list
and then with that list they make a message right and then they send it to everyone in the list but is that so the amount of work needed is so little so little right
and then with that list create a message right and then send it to everybody in the list but well then it doesn't require a lot of work very little right
and with that list they create the message right and then they send to everybody in the list but then the quantity that work that requieres is so little it is very litte right
and so with that list they make their message right and so they send it to everyone in the list but so the quantity of work that is required is little is very little right
and if two or three people answer from the thousands they already earned enough money for for whatever

yes it always happens that if i read an article that looked interesting to me that that microsoft what wants to do know is that it is making something like that a software that does that
always happens i read an article very interesting saying what microsoft wants to do now creating software which
yes alwyas happens like that i read an article that i think it is very interesting that microsoft is now creating a software that does
yes it happens all the time i have read an article that looked pretty interesting that microsoft wants to do that they are making a software
am that that one time i sent a message to the computer that it has to make like a something i do not know that has to break a code or do some task so it is not
everytime that somebody sends a message to the computer has toi don't knowhas to break a code or perform a task
am every time one sends a message the computer has to do a i don´t know has to break a code or do similar task that is not
hum every time that one sends a message the computer has to do something i don't know it breaks a code or do a tasks so its not
very very large
but not very big
very very big
very very big
but it will be required like this a little of work really then if one is sending e mail write one e mail and i will send it noone will not even noticeright
but that it requires like that a bit of work right then if you are only sending email wrote an email and sent without noticing right
so it does take some work right if you are just sending an email writing an email and then sent it you can't even tell right
but that requires a little bit of work right so if you're only sending emails you write an email and you don't even know if you sent it right
and also when also when the computer do the task then break the code exactly then do that also in microsoft will give you a certificate to the e mail
and then when then when the computer does that task then it breaks a code exactly it does that then eh microsoft gives a certificate to the email which the email
so when so when the computer does that stuff so it breaks a code it does exactly that and microsoft then gives you a certificate for the email that the email
and then when then when the computer does that job then it breaks a code then that's exactly what microsoft does uh it gives the email a certificate that the email
that that the person took a little of time to make that right then if only one is sending 2 emails it does not matter then the e mail will arrive and will know that is not spam but if one is sending millions of e mails
that that the person took a little time to do that right then if you are only sending two emails it doesn't matter then the email arrives and you know it is spam but if you are sending millions of emails
that the person wasted a little time doing that right so if you are just sending two emails it doesn't matter the email gets through and you know it's not spam but if you are sending millions of emails
that the person took a little time to make right so if you're only sending two mails it doesn't matter then the mail arrives and it knows it's not spam but if you're sending millions of emails
one one do not have the computer don't have the strength like this the processor cant make a lot of work right
you you don't have the computer doesn't have the strength like that the processor can not do so much work right
you have to your computer can't process them they can't work that much right
you don't have the computer's processing power is not strong enough to do that much work right
sending so many e mails then it will delay more and possibly what is waiting is going to delay so much that i believe it will be too much
to send so many emails then it takes longer and possibly what you wait is that it is going to take what i think is going to be too long
to send so many emails it gets delayed and possibly it is expected to get delayed it's too much
sending so many emails so it takes longer and possibly what it expects is that it will take so long that i think it will be too
slow and they wont be able to send all the e mails that is being sent now a day
slowly and they are not going to be able to send all the emails they send nowadays
too slowly and they can't send all those emails that they send nowadays
slow and they won't be able to send all the emails they send nowadays
is not is nothing in general i'm not going because there's a graduate student that helps you but seriously the class

it is not more more if it's nothing in general i am not going because it is more than that there is a graduate student who helps him but really the class
at the moment when some one receive an e mail without the certificate one knows that is a spam it can be thrown away
and the moment you receive an email without that certificate you know that it is spam and you can discard it
and when you get an email without that certificate you know it's spam and you can delete it
and the moment you get an email without that certificate you know that it's spam and you can throw it out
yea yes i don't know exactly

yes i don't know don't know
yes i don't know i don't know
yes i don't know i don't know
yes i don't know i dont know
but i think that the filters were not to efficient right because if you think that that each time that you put like you can say ah well if have a
but i think that the filters are not are not very like that efficient because if one thinks that that that no that each time that one puts because one can say oh well he has a
but it seems to me that the filters are not are not very like effective actually because yes one things that that that no that every time that you put because one can say ah well if you have a
but it seems like the filters aren't that reliable right because one thinks that every time someone says something like that then yeah it has a
a a what is the suspicious phrase you can send to the spam right but many times then
a an how is that call when you say suspicious phrases it can be sent to the spam right but many times then
a a how do you say it suspect phrases can be sent to spalm actually but many times then
a a like how do you say it its like saying something you suspect you can throw it into the spam folder but sometimes
who believe in the spam they know which one are the the the phrases that that in general activate the filters right
the ones that create the spam know which ones are the the the suspicious phrases so or the phrases that that in general activate the filter right
the ones who create spam you know which ones are the the the suspect phrases then or phrases that that in general activate the truth filter
the people that create the spam know that the frases are suspicious so the frases in general activate
then they believe the the message is the form that no
then they create the the the message in a way that it does not
then they create the message in a way that it doesn't
so then they create that form message right
that won't pick up the filter yes yes then
that the filter doesn't catch it yes yes then
that it doesn't catch the filter yes yes then
don't let him touch the filter that way yeah yeah cause then

mja assistance they give her for them here they do not give you a lot so it is hard have to prove show them that it is real
assistance that they give them here because they don't give you much so it is difficult and you have to prove ehh show them that really
right assistance that they give them here because they don't give you a lot so it's difficult and you have proof that you can show them that in truth
you have this but no matter what and if you do what it takes to get it you have to be working
you have that but anyway and if you do what do what feels and you are working
you have that but in any case if you do what gives you the thing is that if you are working

and if you don't know they don't pay you well but they pay you twenty dollars or a little more than twenty dollars of the
or i think it is less than twenty dollars from what the the limit that they will give you does not help
or i believe les then twenty dollars from the limit they give you they do not help
or i think less than twenty dollars from the from the limit they give you they don't help you
i think less than twenty dollars of the limit they give you is not going to help
i say this because it is twenty dollars over the limit that they have but really that is not a lot
i say they are twenty dollars more then the limit they have but i say is not that much
i say because it is twenty dollars more from the limit they have but i say if that is not too much

but it was much bigger then we went in and saw the living room and kitchen and then up one floor and there they had all their rooms but
it was pretty big but the problem is they were some of the university's new dormitories
it was rather large but the problem is that they were some of the new university dorms
it was quite big but the problem is that they were some of the new university dormitories
it was quite large but the problem is that they were one of the new dormitories at the university
and they had built it in in uh in the university's outskirts so it was pretty far from the university and his classes
and they had built it in in the in a in the outskirts of of the university then it was to a far side of the university and his classes
and they had built it on on the on a on the outskirts of of the university so it was at a really far end of the university and his lectures
and had built outside of the university so i was very far from the university and the classes
were engineering classes that were held at the other side of the university
were of engineering that they were in the other side of the university
they were of engineering that were on the other end of the university
engineering was at the other end of the university
and i say that he's i mean right then i say there's there's a bus system there like

yes yes
yes yes
uhum uhum
uhum uhum
uhum uhum
hmm hmm
the
oh really
to the
to the
eh
eh
ehm
eh
mm good i don't to me
mmm yeah i don't know philly but it does know me
mm well i don't to well to me
hmm well i don't well to me
to me it's like it's the same old story right nothing has happened to me either so sure i think i live in
for me it's like eh with me it's almost like the same story right because for me nothing has ever happened here so but of course i am alive
to me is is the them with me it is almost the same story right because nothing has never never happened here to me s but of course that i live
for me is the uh with me it's almost the same story right because i've never never had anything happen to me here
here close to the university i live in walnut the thirty eight between the thirty eight and the thirty nine
here near to the university i live in walnut 38 between between 38 and 39
here close to the university i live in walnut and thirtyeighth between between between the thirtyeighth and the thirtyninth
here near the university i live in walnut and 38 between between between 38 and 39
so it's not that far away and there are lots of police here so in general i haven't me anyone that has gone through that so i really think that
so it's not very far and here there is a lot of security so mostly i don't know anyone i don't do anything and really i think that
thn it is not very far and here there is a lot of safety and then but in general i i don't know anybody either that that have done nothing to is that seriously i think that
then it's not far and here there is a lot of security and then but in general i i don't know anyone that that has done anything i mean seriously i think that
sure it does happen right i read it in the paper and
of course it's occurred to you right to return it you've seen in a magazine
of course if happens right in by turn you see it it in the newspaper and one
of course it happens right sometimes you see it on the newspaper and one
good and you
fine and you
good and you
fine and you
i think that in general it's kind of weird because in around here we have so much security there are lots of cameras
but in general it's really weird because en this area there is so much security and they have cameras
but in general it is pretty rare because in in these areas there is so much security ehm and they have cameras
but in general it's pretty occasional because in in these areas there is so many security and ah they have cameras
and lights and they have some phones well people or the the cops they have byke it's unbelievable they have
and lights and they have those phones and they have people around the police on bikes that are just incredible they have
and and lights and they have those phones and they have the people the the the police that ride a bike that it is incredible what they what they have to
and and lights and they have those phones and they have the people the the the policeman that ride on the bike that it's incredible what they what they have
they spend lots of money in that but in general they are keeping us safe
and it costs more money but also it's like in general they keep it safer
and they spend a lot of money but also it i it is like in general they maintain it pre pretty safe
and they spend a lot of money but also it it's like in general they keep it pre pretty safe
and i imagine that that the people from the neighborhood for example criminals right know that that they have to be careful with the security in this area
and and i imagine that that that the people from the hood for example or or the criminals right i know that that over here there's so much security that they have to be careful eh
i imagine that the people of this neighborhood by example or the criminals know that there is so security that they have to be careful really
i can imagine that the people of the neighborhood know for example that there are criminals correct i know that here they need security and they have to be very careful
and i think that they can um mm to the people that do crimes so i don't know in general its very safe
and i think that it's been enough times ah mm they can to the to the ones that do crimes then i don't know in general it's secure enough and now
it seems to me that there are many times that it can do with the criminals so i don't know its pretty safe in general and now
and i often think ah mm that there can be crimes but there are those who do not although i think it is generally safe now
in the quad because before that it was security no no it wasn't so strict because one had to pass there and one gave the card to someone else
in the in the quad they have those well because before it was the security no no it wasn't it wasn't so strict because you had to pass through there and you gave the card to a person
in the quad they have of those because the security wasn't so strict before you had to pass and gave your card to another people
there is security in the quad because it used to not be as strict but now you have to go out there and give a person a card
and then they would go get him whats his name the system to see if one was actually a student from there or not
and then they passed through the through the how's that called e the system to see if you really were a student and it wasn't
and then they passed what did they call the system that to see if you really were a student or were not
and then it passed what was it called e this sysem to see if someone is really a student or not
that they didn't make an illegal copy of it right but now
that it wasn't counterfeited eh the card and then you passed right but now
that you were not falsified the card and then you pass right but now
they can't be false with the card and pass through right but now
the thing is that people could have gone in and out like nothing but they now have those systems those new doors that
but the thing is that people went out and it was easy to get in but now they those systems that e those new doors that that
but another thing is that the people get out and was very easy to get in but now they have those sistems with new doors that
but the thing is that when people left it was very easy to enter but now they have this system with a new gate thatthat
you cant do anything at all right so in general they don't worry about someone in the university
that you can't do anything right then in general they worry too much to one on the university
you cant do anything right then they worry very much for the university in general
that you can't do anything right well in general they are very busy and the one at the university
ah well good studying here a a little but and well they called me and i say well why not why not rest a little bit right
fine studying a little bit and they called me and i said well why not why not take a break right
oh well here i'm studying a little bit and then they called me and i say well why not why don't i rest a little right
oh ok here studying a a bit and well i got a call and i say why not why don't i take a rest right
um
eh e
heh
eh e
yes
yes
yes
yes
no um
no e
no
no e
yes
yes
yes
yes
uhum
uhum
mmmm
mhm
yes yes
yes yes
yes yes
yes yes
well philadelphia has lots of neighborhood that are dangerous because
well philadelphia has many neighborhoods that aren't even because
well philadelphia has many dangerous neighborhoods because
well philadelphia has many dangerous neighborhoods because
they have they are they have secure neighborhoods right so one has too from the university that is also in general secure but
uh uh they have they're they're and the neighborhood is plenty secure right so one has here from the university which is also in general very secure but
eh they have and the neighborhood is really safe right so then you have here the one of the university which in general is also very safe but
e eh they have they are they are and the neighborhood is fairly safe right so one has here from the university that in general is also fairly safe but
yes one goes north north philly all that then south philly and west philly its not necessary
say say if one goes to to the to the north like in north philly and all of that and south philly and west philly and well it's not necessary but more
say it you go to the north like in north philly all that and south philly and west philly and well is not necessary but more
s say if you go to to to the north like that in north philly all of that and south philly and west philly and well it's not necessary but more
so it really gets dangerous so it does for example if one wants to go out at night they wont go to north philly so its not that
i mean only that gets very very dangerous so but also to for example if one is going to go out at night they're not go to north philly to go out then it's not so
in other words only that gets very very dangerous so but also for example if you are going to go out at night you are not going to go out to north philly so then is not so
i mean only that it's very very dangerous so but also all for example if you go out at night you're not going to go to north philly to go out so it's not so
and how are you how are your classes
and how are you how are your classes going
and how are you how are your classes
and how are you how's school going
important right
to important right
so important right
so important right
well for us
for well for us
for us
so well for us
yes why yes if one goes out one goes to philadelphia but that's an old city so they have cops and everything
yes because if if one is going to go out if one goes to philadelphia but if one goes to old city but then in old city there is so much people that go out that they have police and everything
yes because if if you are going to go out if you are going to philadelphia but that you go to old city but then in old city there are so many people that go there that they even have police there and everything
yes because if if on is going to go out if on goes to philadelphia but if one's going to old city but then in old city there's so many people that goes out that there are many policemen there and everything
so
so then
then
so
yes um in general there aren't really many students in the old city the majority of the students stay in the university
yes uh yes in general well also there aren't many students that that go to old city in general the students are they stay here at at the university
yes eh yes in general well also there are not that many students that go to old city usually the students are they stay here in the university
yes eh yes in general well also there are not so many students that go to old city in general the students are they stay here in in the university
i think um yeah in general but people complain too much that there's no security because we live in a bad neighborhood
it seems to me uh yes well in general but the people complain to much that there is that there isn't security here that we're in a bad neighborhood and
i think eh yes well generally but people complain too much that there's no security here that we are in a bad neighborhood and
i think eh yes well in general but people complain a lot that there is no security here that we're in a bad neighborhood and
but in general i mean there is every week one read the the the so there is once a
but in general it's it's that that if if every week one reads the the the d p then there's there's uh once that
but generally is is that yes every week you read the the d p so there is there is one time that
in general it's it's that that yes yes every week one read the the the dp so there are there are eh once there
there was a robbery or something so one goes and naturally thinks whats happening right but
that there was an an assault of whatever then one goes one naturally thinks that that it's that it's occurring a lot right but
that there was an assault or whatever so then you naturally think that is that is happening a lot right but
there was a a mugging or whatever so one goes one thinks naturally that it's it's happening a lot right but
in reality its im one thinks that they will get jumped or will jump two hundred students but there's twenty thousand students so the probability is that
in in reality it's a one thinks well perhaps they assault or rob i don't know two hundred students but since there are twenty thousand students and then the probability that the
in in reality is a you think well maybe they assault or rob i don't know two hundred students but there's like twenty thousand students so the probability that the
in in reality it's a one things maybe that they mug or rob from i don't know two hundred students but there are about twenty thousand students and then the probability that the
that that happens to one
that that happens to one
what what if it happens to one
that happens to oneself
uhum uhum
uhum uhum
uhum uhum
uh um uh um
of course it exists right but is not that that tall
of course it exists right but it's not so so high
of course it exists right but its not so high
of course it exist right but it is not that high
yes yes
yes yes
yeah yeah
yes yes
yes yes yes but that also seems to me me that it is better to live like that in like something like univeristy highrises because no especiall if one returns over there in at in the night and
yes yes yes but that also i think that is better to live like in something like highrises of college because not specially if you go back there in at at night and
yeah yeah yeah but that too i think its better to live like that like something from the high rises of the university specially if someone goes at night
yes that's why i think that it's better to live in something like the university highrises because specially if you get home late at night
is that is ehm yes well it is nice to have to
it's just it's uh yes well it's nice to have
its just that um yeah its nice too
yes well it's nice to have
to walk for a long time the people that live like that in baltimore but the squares in baltimore are huge they must over there that
than walking a long time people who live like that in baltimore but the blocks on baltimore are huge there they have to
too walk a long time people live in baltimore but the blocks are big their should be
to walk a long time people lives like this in baltimore but the blocks in baltimore are huge they must to
yes huge uhm
yeah huge um
yeah huge um
yes huge huh
there is no light there is no light
there's no there's no light
there's not light no light
yes not light at all
yes there is no light yes and but in highrises it is better more calms one does not have to buy uhm all of the furniture
yes there's no light yes and but in highrises it's better it's quiet you don't have to buy all the uh furniture
yeah there's no light but highrises are better its calmed you don't have to buy every piece of furniture
yes not light al all but in the high rises is better is quiet and you don't have to buy all the forniture
ehm if something happens one calls the university and they take care of them
uh if something happens you call college and they take care of it
eh if something happens you just call the university
if anything happens you call the university and they take care
but and and one has to to also there are a lot i've heard a lot of stories like of problems between people that that share an apartment
but and and you have to that also there are many i have heard many stories of the problems between people who who share an apartment

but no
but no
but no
but no
well the ldc what they do is collect many types of linguistic data whether that's text like it might be tex um something spoken and then it can be used for for many things for for example
well the ldc collects lots of data in text oral etc then you can use it for lots of things for example
well the ldc what it does is collect all type of lagnostic data can be test like it testeh oeal thing then this may be used for many things like for example
well the ldc what it does is collect many types of linguistic data be it text like tex eh the oral thing and then this can be used to for many things for for example
uh programs that that can understand voice nee need training they don't need
oh programs that can be understand the voice they need an entertainment they don't need
ah programs that can understand voice needthey need a training do not need
ah programs that that can understand voice need need some training don't need
a sample let's say
a demo lets say
a sample should we say
a sample let's say
and it then um for example for this it's possible and and for studies of for example how people pronounce the letter this way up to the dialog how it develops i don't know what or for
so then mm for example for that and for studies like that people pronounce a word how to say it i don't know for what i mean

i mean its not particularly pretty or nothing but i mean its like you say there's some good places to walk a bit and
in other words is not only singular or particular nice not even but but then in other words is like you said they have beautiful places to walk a while and
what this means this is not very nice or anything similar to it but it is as you said you have nice places to take a walk
then it isn't either singularly or specially beautiful or anything but then like i mean is like you say it has nice places where you can walk awhile and
and well living here as a university student well um um everyone lives here so at the same time you don't want to be too far away from here because then you get disconnected from the university place and students

well i am living as a university student i don´t want to be far away from here i want to be in touch with the people and the university
and then this too i say like living here as a student then this like all the people is living here then at the same time like then they don't want to be too far from here because you are like disconnected from the university people then
me too i think
also i believe
i also believe that
also i think
that's why the people that live in universities find it comforting
that is why we have this accommodation to those whom live in the university

yes it's a huge displacement i mean
that is to yes it is impressing to see that like the more you go to the the west well more black people you start to have and every time there are less whites
you know it's striking to see that like the more to the west you go the more black people there is and less and less whites
yes is incredible to see that the more you go to the west there are more black people and there's less whites

everybody was black when you went to the eas to the west
everyone was black when i was going towards the west
everybody was black when the bus was going to the west
yes but well that that too well it is like as a result of that i mean the fact that the majority of the of the black people here well is is of the lesser income then well
yes but well that's that's also well it's like it's a consequence of you know the fact that the majority of of the people here are black well is is of the lowest income then well
yes but that's also a result of that the majority of the the the black people here are of lower income therefore
yes but well that's that too well it's a consequence of the i mean the fact that most people most black people well they are poor so well

each person has so i don't know what they are going to do there are lots of people now my mo she has reached twenty five calls
have each person then don't know what vwhat they dobecause there are many persons that for example they have reached the twenty five calls
