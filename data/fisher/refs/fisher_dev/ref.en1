aha
yes yes
yes
yes hmm
oh and where are you from
hmm yes yes let me tell you something
there in barranquilla in colombia that's where i'm from
there is the same problem too
but what results um at home us at the church we attend
eh well we spoke and everything and we reached a conclusion
in that aspect the women are pretty no and they have to dress up because they aren't going around like that all of the time
exactly there for in that sense
if there there are people who get really bothered so they see the other as being less than everyone else
and they look at you really strangely but i don't pay any attention because and more my my sisters i have two sisters
they dress up really pretty they are young and you have to get really pretty
oh i see
so then no yes but there are people who get really bothered
sometimes they do not greet you
or but no but yes they have their way of thinking and are sometimes like very stubborn
really because is not like that is like i say
but well you must
yes
yeah
yeah
mhm
yes
i'm from colombia yes
yeah yeah
yes
of course and we had to be pretty because yeah one fixes and does good to go to a party its right that
it has nothing to do with god and non of that oh when one goes to church one has to go dressed good
looking good
exactly exactly
exactly yea
yeah
yeah
what things and
eh yes about religion

there there is a lot of poverty and there is no work
and here no here you obtain work wherever you want
but but the family when like my family stayed there is puerto rico my mother is there and my brothers
carmen
and my nieces y sometimes i go to see them
but but i am not going to live there in puerto rico because i have my two children here
although they are adults now but they still live with me
until they don't get married and each of them gets their profession and they leave with their wife and husbands
eh no not possible i can't go there to puerto rico calm down
in puerto rico yes yes
ah
no i came here to stay i went to florida with my mom and my younger brothers
and from florida i went here to chicago with my mom and my younger brothers too
after that my mom went to puerto rico
is it the first time that we talk no
and my younger brothers went to puerto rico therefore i stayed here and since i got married i stayed here
but my mom was coming and going but my mom didn't like it here because of the cold weather
because no and she says that that that what is the use of being here caught inside four walls and in puerto rico she can be coming and going from her house
it is not the same
in puerto rico aha aha aha
but my mom is catholic and my aunt is catholic
and and and uhm but how uhm my uncle is christian he goes and reads the bible to my mom and and and
and he talks to her much about god and as her ask my mom questions about god and my mom answers him
but he does not like it because my mom uhm after my grandpa died my mom tweezed her her eyebrows my mom her
she had done uhm wholes in her ear to wear earrings
okay
shaved her legs she would wear pants she would wear dresses
and my grand and my da my uncle did not like it
because he says that the women should not wear pants
in his religion in his religion
mother
he says that the women should not wear pants because pants are made for men
but my uncle is very very very how is he enthusiastic about religion
he has a religion devoutly like he
that yes he doesn't say to his sons that they are religious
it's only to my mom my sisters my nieces my nephews but to the sons he doesn't say anything
in chicago
so for that i say to him that that he in order to believe in god he does not have to spend 6 days out of the week in the church
but he spends 7 days a week in the church
he is on on saturday he says that he is going to church since very early in the morning
until the evening and on sunday all of the whole day in church
so he is very fanatic with the church
i have a friend that she is christian and she only she says that she goes to church
saturday and sunday
but my uncle is on the seven days of the week
and he is always talking about god that god over here that god over there
and i always him when i go to puerto rico i tell him
29 years
g god we always have him next to us the twentyfour hours of the day
y y i tell him you don't have to go to church to talk go god because right in your same bed you can speak to god
the only thing is that one can't ask father god only how is it believing about father god only when one has problems but all the time
because there is some people that
oh god what  cocedeme this oh my god that when they are bue they don't have any problem
then they don't remember that father god exists

but aha it is
well i think well i'm catholic
and i believe in god very much but no i do not practice or go go church every day
because i was taught from childhood by the father
we got on our knees and we knelt around the bed
and we were all there my father my mother and my brothers
i asked god for dad for all of us
and my dad always taught us that to for you to believe in god you don't have to go to church
ah but i have an uncle who is a christian
fine thank god and you
but this it is in puerto rico
but every so often that i go to puerto rico he wants one to change religions from catholic to theirs because they say that the catholic
is a ehm is a religion that that ehm how is it that you can that is that womean ca can go to with pants with earrings that they cut their hair
that they use makeup
the he says that that is not good
that that ehm in ah that catholics are very liberal not like christians that they wear their their
i mean that women put on their dresses of their skirt and blouses
and long skirt and and no haircuts and no earrings and no makeup
then uhm but my uncle is in the religion
and and he doesn't believe that that
yes it's very cold
that the same god that the same god that he is worshipping is the same one that we are worshipping as well
aha
aha
aha
aha
aha
aha aha natural aha aha aha aha
aha
aha aha aha aha
aha
i'm from puerto rico
aha aha aha
yeah yeah
mhm
yeah
mhm
but also in school in the catholic church also i remember when my children were small
for i took them to church
and we were waiting to see the come out first the first turn was for for the americans
we were waiting and behind me there was a hispanic woman
that was talking about the lady that was getting out that if she thought she was going to a party that her outfit was very
and you
very colorful to go to church that her shoes were to high that she looked too dressed that she looked like
that she was going to a party that she did not looked like she was at a church
and i looked at her and said
how is she talking that if she loves god
ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha
but its not as much as to be talking to the neighbor if you go to a church
i suppose you don't talk about your neighbor
but she um i looked at her and said wow my god is she talking that way how would it be
if you see a woman on the streets showing most of her body
oh do you know today's topic
oh
ha
yes i was born in puerto rico and raised there too
and i came here in the united states when i was 1819 years old aha
and i got married
yes and i have a girl of 28 and a boy of 26
and i have almost 50 years
yes
oh yeah
oh same as my son's age
hello milgred of connecticut
adventists or they are um of the evangelicals
or they are of the of the others is of those of the those that sell uh oh what are they called the l i forgot the name
bet there are many many races and many religions
but i don't find annoying other religions i understand any religion if they don't try to force me do you follow
yes not fans
yes
yeah religion is like politics
and according how you see it well not everyone will agree do you understand me
yeah but is good to discuss about everything beacuse if you know well i have cousins and aunts in the evangelic religion
and the rest are catholics
how are you good evening
and on the other side of my family they are adventist
but when we get together nobody is talking about religion and you must be in that way you must change
and my cousin's husband is evangelical so he's almost always in church and she doesn't belong to the church y they have a very happy marriage
and she she doesn't she goes o only when they have special occasions like mothers when they make a special ceremony for moms when they have in in
in what else they celebrate because they don't celebrate christmas but they have o there other occasions that
the evangelicals
aha yes the evangelicals so my cousin's husband i tell you is and was not evangelical they got married in that religion and after they got married he got into that church and she didn't
and she dances she drinks and she jumps and he goes with her to work parties and everything and he's there and no
i mean he's not telling people ah you have to stop smoking you have to stop drinking you have to there's no time in which
they make jokes at parties very well she doesn't get in a bad mood or anything you know that that that nothing of this that you shouldn't say that no very happy
hm
yes that is it's a person that everything depends who or whom whom how how the person takes it but if they get fanatical forget about it
that's it
aha
aha well that's aha they're like with my cousin
oh really
aha
aha
that is you don't go to church or anything
no
i go to church but no i'm not with what one calls a very devout woman always going to church no
do you believe that it unites disunites or
you don't like
aha
aha
or yes yes i believe that is a very important foundation especially for the children
but yeah you raise them with at least with with some you forget they go and and they're i don't know they they get kinda wild kind
it's like they have no feelings i mean they don't create a feeling in relation to anything
you understand it's like nothing matters to them
and and and you where from you say you're christian and that it's a miracle that uh you were accepted in his family seeing that jewish are almost always
they're how do you say it they're
they try to marry only between themselves and to have the same religion
or do you believe that if everyone were of the same religion we would be better or we would be equal or it would be
right uh
but did you marry by catholic or jewish
oh that's nice oh yeah right
uh um
and let them decide right
the my youngest daughter the older are they were baptized and they're catholic but the little one despite being baptized in the catholic school she also visits the church
the evangelic church
she goes with my cousin's husband and you know when she goes she wears her long skirt you know like she respects their their
their religion and she she likes to go with them and i never said no to her when she asked me  can we take her i was like  oh yes
you know
much better the world
and because uh uh i think that the bible establishes that that the that the man wears pants something like that uh
it's related to that
um those are the ones who become fanatics that
they interpret word for word to what's written you understand
it's like the these the iraqi ones with their doctrine that madness that they kill people in the name of of
from that god they have or from other or in what they believe
then sometimes you have people with brains somehow distorted
interpreting something that must truly unite because the religion must unite doesn't matter it's kind you got it i don't think that because a persona and religion and other then
they must kill each other for that for the other for that belief
then for me like i'm neutral to all that i i don't get fanatic with none i notice that i was raise in the catholic religion
uh huh uh huh
and was helping in the church i was part of daughters of maria club and i was helping allot that is
and was my belief the catholic and not only eh i took my children to the church too and baptized them because that way i was raise too
they are grownup people and they can go wherever they want to i will understand i will not tell them that they cant visit other churches too
oh you can't believe in that because catholic say they're different you know
majority of the people are of them are in gospel or jehovah's witnesses nad they want to force you believe they come to your home in the morning and try to sell their stuff
yes indeed sometime they come and i tell them thanks i have the small book or else look i'm catholic
they are unwise
aha
i had a lady that came and every time i crossed my door the woman arrived and started look do you want to help us buy this little book do you know that
you're sinning and whatever but the thing is i've been a sinner since my daughter was born so the lord will reprimand me when i arrive up there well
yeah yes i think that it's it's the same and how it doesn't we aren't of the same races so the each race has its
eh yes they try i don't know they try to tell you such negative things instead of telling you look you can know more about the lord and i don't know from
from other points of view but that you're a sinner thing yes yes i keep sinning and right now you're sinning by talking like that
its doctrine own or and and even though we are hispanic some of us acquired that in eh sometimes they aren't neither or that is sometimes we are some catholic families and the others are of the family they are
hello
mmm
exactly that they don't try to force you
or oppress you to don't feel forced yes
try to talk to yut i think that's is how it's called what divides religion is the differences
well in everything you believe there are always differences
exactly
yes that's why you should never discuss religion that's why i can't believe why they make us discuss religion in this program
hmm
mmm
mmm
mercedes speaking from philadelphia
who are they
ok
hm
i my house what happened is that
that eh my mom is evangelical
and my dad didn't um go to church really he never decided
and but all of us went to a catholic school
yes then because n then we had of the always christians then but
eh we had eh that is which we learned in school we didn't reinforce it at home
and now if i believe that my of my brothers and sisters only the majority are catholic still my little sister eh eh i believe that she's envangelical and i don't i've decided that i don't have a religion
mm good evening back at you
mm no
uh huh no
hm mm hm mm not i since i yes almost left i came to college and i left college i already decided that i wasn't going to return to
to church no not me no the interesting truth that eh to me organized religion no no
no no exac not that i don't like but no i don't feel the nece that is because i feel that god i have him in my heart
and therefore i am passing my life by eh but we say it's already later now my wife is jewish and my son is jewish too and we are going to raise him jewish
because if i believe that one needs bel eh to grow up with a religion
yes yes definitely i
uh um
uh um yeah
let's see that we speak about religion then
yeah yeah that's why i i agree that yeah yeah he it's that they yeah well children do need it and that's why they say
right yeah they really are
yeah we were lucky
yeah yeah it's there's really there are some of them of course there are some that are very strict right
but no my husband's family has always been very understanding even the other son married a girl she's also not
jewish and i think i imagine that maybe that's why right i was the second one i wasn't
no we had a religious a jewish ceremony
yeah and let's say and that's what i say well my son will be raised and i say it's important that he's raised with a religion
when he's an adult he can decide what he wants to do
right if he wants to keep or if he wants i don't know stop being be something else whatever but i do think that whatever religion a child has to be raised with a very definite religion
hm
uh um
i don't understand that because let's say my mom uh that she says that when she when she goes to church she has to wear a skirt
then i tell her but what's wrong with wearing pants
yes but to me that and that to me was one of the um
reasons right that uh not keeping away from but since a little from organized religion any organized religion that there's people that's too strict about the bible well they take it
uh yes
um um
hmmm
hmm
yes
mm i believe that i i that which i think is that that the
hmmm
ay but there are people good i understand them
is their job but they want people to convert into their religion true but they don't respect either
true or maybe not there are some
someone would be of the same religion as everyone we would be of the same religion it's impossible because i think that always there are going to be eh cultural differences
and that always it's going to make that each person interprets the that only religion to his own way what do you think
hm mm
good evening how are you doing with norma from atlanta georgia and where are you from
mi husband is american yes
so then what do you think about religions
yes
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
well i am a very religious person and am a believer for the hare krishna religion not sure if you heard about that
mhm yes it is based on hindu philosophy
so one we believe that one is a part or portion of god and we also believe in reincarnation we have rules and regulations we are vegetarians we do not eat meat eggs or fish
ah ok
mm we don't drink alcoholic beverages
because we believe that that every living body deserves respect and no to avoid violence against other living beings
that's why we don't eat meat we don't intoxicate ourselves with drugs or alcohol
we don't drink coffee or tea
and we don't play lasso games
no and are you religious do you take part in any religion
mhm
mhm
but you do believe in god
oh that's very good i mean many times you can't identify with a group of people a group of right
i am from peru
but the important thing is for one to have god right in your heart and you try to like develop your relation with god that's very important
um a supreme being
sure
um yes
um
of course a supreme being that controls everything that happens
right and religion really i mean religion or your beliefs about a supreme being uh right they unite people because when there's a disaster or when there's suffering you always
right you turn around and you always ask god to please help you every body there are many people that even call themselves atheists and when they're desperate they always
they don't ask they ask god for his help
no that is actually when somebody has it in their heart one knows when their is somebody supreme above themselves
ah ok there are many peruvian here
mhm that's right mhm
yeah yeah that's right in the philosophy that we have there is always a verse that says when somebody is suffering
one always one always asks god for help but people says that you also get to suffer so that you can remember about him more often
because when somebody is ok one forgets about gods relationship
um that's true right because when somebody is doing good they're happy
no because one already thinks one controls someone but not that you're the one that controls everything that happens right
no but really its when god blesses you and helps you in many circumstances
and do you have a believe according to the reincarnation or something like that have you heard about karma
mhm
yeah yeah one of the laws of karma is a law of action and reaction that you follow then positive or negative activities don't have either a negative or positive reaction
ah are you from mexico
beacause of this it's often said but why so many things happen to people sometimes you see good people but they really are
reactions to past lives where one did a lot of negative actions and now it's a negative reaction that they're suffering
it's not that really you don't have very innocent people or people who are really good that it's only the reaction like one has free will
not to do what you want god doesn't demand that we believe in him or that we serve him or to go to his devotional service because of this
one doesn't use his free will and does negative things and many times this is a reaction to the law of karma for this law of karma of that no one is free of the law of karma it's unbreakable
mm this is what we think or what we believe
in our religion yes
yes since now i'm married and i live here in the apartment close to the temple where we have
the temple here in georgia in atlanta but before i lived in the temple and i was interning there i made service not to krishna but to god
no there are different types of services that one can do one prays one sings the holy names of the lord one cooks for the lord to give offerings to god
ah ok
and you do different activities no
not all or rather one realizes that your the center of your life is god no and one offers him everything that he makes all his work the whole kitchen everything he makes and in the moment that he wakes up one goes to the alter and reads
and we offer food to the gentleman then it is well now i am married and have kids and i have to worry about them
now but i always go to the temple no and always have the devout there and we reunite the majority of the sundays or for big celebrations that we have during year
mhm
well we have bhaktivedanta prabhupada ace bhaktivedanta prabhupada it is god's devout one that brought this knowledge here to the occident
no y and he is the one that we eh in reality no ohonor and
well we respect jesus christ a lot also it's not like we do not respect other religions other beliefs
of course and but he brought acknowledgment here to the occident close to krishna's conscious like ourselves we we call it by the name of the city
mhm
mhm
mhm
it's called international society for the conscience of krishna
it's called ace bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada
yes he was born at india
well he's not in this planet he died he abandoned his body
no i mean he's devout he is considered a pure devout of god so he has gone back to the spiritual world
no he doesn't reincarnate because the whole point of this life this material world is to develop a devotion for god
so when you go back to the spiritual world the spiritual world doesn't go back to this material world we are through the cycle of birth sickness and death all living things
no even animals human beings
no
no i stay home taking care of my kids
nn aha
yes he has passed that level he's a pure devout now
it's really interesting it would be good for you to get involved if you can
peruvian no no my husband is
hello
ahh from peru or american
ah okay ah very well
so then i believe that since the medieval times or so
religion was lost during institucinalization well what a i mean with that is that religion ceased to be something spiritual
and turned into something more political and then lately it has ceased to be so political although it keeps carrying much of it
like institutions so you can be very religious and spiritual
but not neccesarily institutionalist so maybe you do not need to agree what the church says o agree what
some institution like the jewish or catholic or islamic says but then may be you can as i said with other matters mix a little of the philosofy of all of them and
use them somehow to take a good way of life more than anything
what do you think
i am arthur i am good i am in pensylvania philadelphia
ah yes yes i never heard them i do not know how they are very well what is haré krishna about
aham
and why not why don't you eat meat why do you think that
ah okay
aha
yes
no game to lasso
and no no i don't belong to any institution for the moment i was born and raised catholic and but right now much bigger right now i have twenty one years
like eighteen years and after i didn't follow the institution because well it didn't interst me much what they practiced and
and more i thought that before my spirituality my contact with
nice to meet you where are you from norma
with this god well no it didn't need to be across this institution then i dedicated myself to read about other religions a little but more than anything to
to cultivate myself and to practice a good way of life but
i don't like any i don't like the institutions
yeah definitely but no
exactly
yeah yeah precisely acknowledge that there really is
a divinity behind everything right
but yeah i mean well based on that i've changed a lot and in fact i study chemical engineering and many times people think that sciences tend to uh
let's say break people's religion corrupt it
but i think the opposite because people who starts to know this well they're very scientific and stuff like that is normally very religious because
peruvian mine mine mine roomate is peruvian
because the more they know the more they learn and they can explain
the more questions arrive and and the more the world discovers this is unexplainable and there are miraculous things all the time and everywhere and
i feel that every time the more people know how those scientists and those people understands more that there must be a divine chaos a a divinity behind everything
yes
yea yeah yeah yes to that
yes that's right you just don't ask for help in a religion but you thank it
i think that people start being religious in certain moments because they need help but once they're ok they're over it
yes
yes
yeah nobody remembers it
from lima many mexicans also
yes yes yes
yes yesyes of course
well i've heard about karma and how karma is like like if you had bad karma you would reincarnate in a different person
to make it better not to clean it not to have another opportunity than to make your karma better purer isn't something so
ah okay
yes
yes
yes
oh yeah i see the hare krishnas
and and and what do you do you meet with the hare krishnas every week or daily
yes i am from mexico
yeah
ah yes
aha
certainly
ah okay do you guys have a prophet or something that is like jesus christ how is it
aha
what is its name
of course
ah okay
what is the gentleman's name
mexico city
what is his name
oa okay okay but how it is named the man who brought her
wow that's hindhi or where is it from
ah okay
ah okay but so it's possible that he has reincarnated in somebody else or does he reincarnate because he has karma
ah okay so he doesn't reincarnate anymore
aha
yes exactly
okay sure
so so he's moved on from this level he doesn't reincarnate anymore
very well and in georgia do you work or study
okay
ah very interesting
and how long have you been in that religion
ah ok very well and your husband is is from

i don't know because i think that the other day i talked with someone who lives in her house and told me she was from an island there is no
it is not granada but it was an island from
from there in the caribbean that has a special languages and no something like it is
yes but in any case she understand well yes one
you explain it well she understands look and this about email have you bought with have you solicited
jaaaaaa
no
ah
ah that you won this that that you put like me they arrive by msn i have msn
so josefina was prizewinning with this your cousing here has a free scholarship and you have i don't know
and a trip and the cruises a
and i delete them because those are to know
if one responds to them not for
mhm
ah
i day and how do they verify if so of one no
two days two three days yeah
weird people
wow
mhm mhm
to cover costs right
o but
but that is horrible
i asked didn't buy but they installed it from msn right
i think that it filters a little but not always junk where it says junk you have ten or twelve a day right
aha
so
oh my god
mmh
aha
ah
or it has to bring like an annex or an attachment or something like that that says
if you want to open this email something like that you said
aha mine has i say they have done because when i send through yahoo because i have a mail a division
on yahoo and sometimes when i am going to send an email it asks me ah to identify something that is like deciphered it has to be deciphered no
he says this to protect
messages something like that
then put the pieces the letters as you see them
not mainly
but sometimes say it is a r j
you and a number and something like that
you have seen it that it is not like a crossword puzzle like a puzzuddle isn't it
i don't know if that is what the
to protect
oh yes
ohhh
that does not filter
oh and how it is in the in the forums you have thought in those forums of of the univision or telemundo
and when you write you a work like stupid or idiot ehm it doesn't it doesn't catch it no that is it says we don't allow that type of vocabulary in this
sure and in a week you told me that you had an exam like friday or something like that
mm a little of each one
hello good evening ah is jose
a math class that i'am taking and i'am also taking eh i'am taking a marketing market class i also have another one another homework then
ah in a week yes you have a busy week but at least i have
all these two days free yes
ah i still don't i i it's that many nights i'm busy and and i can't then
only i have maybe twelve thirteen yes
ahh yes that's the reason why i want to hurry because i now that soon
there are people that will stop doing it
ahh
m
ahh
ah good good and well ah well here calm there are no classes tomorrow then tomorrow and tuesday
ahh yes almost everyone
knows someone at the university or they study at the university because
but i just don't know how they would know about that
okay yes of course sure no problem
yes yes yes no matter
no but it seems to me that this program has had a few problems with the computers or the i'm not really sure what kind of devices they use to call
they record with because sometimes two times it happened to me that i was in the middle of a conversation and all of a sudden the line goes dead
mhm mhm yes shudong yes
yes
yes those
yes then i came back to the house on fall break
yes shudong
yeah shudong says just to hang up on them but i feel bad doing that but i don't know
ahh
mmh mh
ah
yes
but is she american or
mmm
ah and not necessarily spanish
yes yes yes
holidays then yes here i am resting
no never never well what i have is that i on my account because i have two accounts one on hotmail and one on
at the university and at the university they almost never send me
this way unpopular mail but in hotmail is terrible all of them every day i receive
20 25 messages and all garbage but
mhm
ah
eh yes
yes
yes the sad part is that with but because what the people do is they send all that mail is that they have they put ah they create programs
that go across the internet of the site of a website to another website then when they find
yes no yes then yes as well do not have classes on friday
an email address
they put it in a list and then if
yes yes then and also go to news group and also go to
all all all and then is very easy then for example the directories for example i imagine hotmail directory too
search for names and search and then create a huge list
and then with that list create a message right and then send it to everybody in the list but well then it doesn't require a lot of work very little right
and if two three people among thousands reply then they made enough money for whatever
yes yes it is sad
with two or three dimwits they annoy everybody else right
mhm
then well well i have classes on friday but no
mm
always happens i read an article very interesting saying what microsoft wants to do now creating software which
everytime that somebody sends a message to the computer has toi don't knowhas to break a code or perform a task
but not very big
but that it requires like that a bit of work right then if you are only sending email wrote an email and sent without noticing right
and then when then when the computer does that task then it breaks a code exactly it does that then eh microsoft gives a certificate to the email which the email
that that the person took a little time to do that right then if you are only sending two emails it doesn't matter then the email arrives and you know it is spam but if you are sending millions of emails
you you don't have the computer doesn't have the strength like that the processor can not do so much work right
to send so many emails then it takes longer and possibly what you wait is that it is going to take what i think is going to be too long
slowly and they are not going to be able to send all the emails they send nowadays
it is not more if it is not in general i do not go because there is more then a student graduating that helps but seriously the class
and the moment you receive an email without that certificate you know that it is spam and you can discard it
yes yes i don't know exactly
i don't exactly know what it is but i i think it is a good idea
mmh
mm
yes
yes yes
ok
mhm
and the numbers yes
ah it is during the week that there is a teacher but only if we need help
yes i have seen them yes hmm hmm
yes i don't know i don't know
but i think that the filters are not are not very like that efficient because if one thinks that that that no that each time that one puts because one can say oh well he has a
a an how is that call when you say suspicious phrases it can be sent to the spam right but many times then
the ones that create the spam know which ones are the the the suspicious phrases so or the phrases that that in general activate the filter right
then they create the the the message in a way that it does not
that the filter doesn't catch it yes yes then
ohh if every once in a while
oh how interesting
then yes yes on friday then i was studying and also have yes i have few things this week on friday i also have homework for
hello hows it going
i think about the mail no requested so it is one roll
that i immediately throw it in the trash
when it arrives
it gets me mad
yes yes
mhm well and for and the thing with the email is a scandal the thing with spam
which one do you use yahoo
oh gmail yes yes
mhm
mhm
very well im miguel angel and i m in philadelphia and you
yes yes i have yes it's true i have yahoo and also and also the spam it sends it to a different folder and
and if you don't want to read you don't no you don't read if you don't want to
mm yes no no that is it is true
ah no no
yes yes yes
mm if not i also the spanish i look i have been living in spain aha until last year i have been here just a year here you know in the united states
and well in spain also i mean there is also a lot of spam there i don't know no no the language doesn't matter there so this is already international
bad things get everywhere right away ah
ah i have bought i have bought things on the internet i mean i have bought books on amazon and i have bought concert tickets and all that but it has always been by my own initiative you know that
eh if i want to buy a book or i want to buy a cd or if i want to buy a concert or movie ticket i mean
you are in new york mhm from where from argentina don't tell me
but it is simple because i wanted you know never because they have sent me span and i had opened them and have bought because it is directly i don't read it you know i delete it
then no and when i get something on the mail that i haven requested well i mean i throw it out directly you know that i don't even see it
and sometimes well man also it is true that some times i read it no but mh no generally i never care and have you bought something
mmh
mhm
yes yes
besides big part of those things are like they sell you and after that they don't send they get your money
they send you a low quality product like they send you those things they aren't completely because they sell it no the we get to see that and other stuff sometimes
i've met people that bought and said this is shit this is a thing that breaks in two days
it breaks or you know that they aren't quality stuff because if you say
ouch im sorry because like you had the  cho you know you have the new  chor so i thought i said she is from argentina
if you said this is good this is bad this is like this and that but all that regarding spam is all nothing but junk
is like is something like yes the sell of that and all those magazines full of
ridiculous stuff then you have a thing to scratch you back and that's one you saw all that and the magazines full of garbage junk stuff
you saw that stupid things
yes that for example one
and you saw that those are like small bots that have plug and they warm you legs you saw that
yes and things like that no that they sell it to you the lady goes out like that sir with feet in stuck in the little ball that
gets hot and it warms up feet and sometimes i want to buy that my mother
of course
mmh
oh good good
yes
yes
ah no no the ones who call you on the phone yes i directly say no to them
i am sorry i am sorry i am not interested and that is it and i hang up
yes
ok man you don't know it happens to me also i feel shame for the people who is working on that don't laugh because is true
i feel shame for the people who has to work calling then if i'm not interested i say i'm not interested and hang up the phone
but i try to be polite because you know the people is working to get a salary for the telemarketers is not pleasant
that the people offend and insult them or hang the phone just without any answer because i was working on that
i don't know when i was young and i was studying well i'm still studying but when i was younger
how you how you told me you name was
in the summer you know i worked as a telemarketer and i was not a seller no i was not selling
i was receiving calls i wasn't calling
i was working for a spain supplier and also an insurance company
about how do call it here road assistance
then the people call me because their car was broken and we send them a breakdown truck to take them to the garage
i was working eight hours a day and there is a moment that you are fed up because everyone is calling to tell you their problems
and insulting you telling you that the assistance is not there treating me bad and you have no blame at all i was the last guy
i was just an employee i didn't have any idea you know if the company was good or bad i was there just because they were paying me
answering calls and give the best service that's why i feel a little shame for the people who is calling
because those people who calls you do not intend to make the puñeta people calling you do not have to bother intecion people calling you to eat eat you and me you know
atri
and want to have a job then
i do not know gives me a little sad or understand that yes no no penalty will not for i will buy a product i sell that that that would be the last straw
but you know but at least treat him well and say look it is now i do not care because people know as they say here does not have a lot of attitude here in the us
is one is one of the things that i notice i notice as cultural difference no and i call being in spain being an  edge
do not know that to me or not you know sometimes you have to be  edge because people are you up a little hump sometimes not but the beard
when there is no need to be  edge because there is no because you know
yeah
of course
yes yes
hey tell odri what do a peruana with argentine accent in new york
ah oh oh odri like odri
ah
ah
mmm
oh of course
ah for that is
mmm
oh sure
good good very good
aodri hello and hows it going
yes
no yes i ohm
for me that when i open my email and i see a bunch of when i see that it get oh and say look at this because sometimes it says things like
five nine messages and i have to see who wrote to me and i see there are five new ones and four
go straight to junk
no but the good thing is that for example the email service that i use
what do you call it no i use gmail so
yes they can and you can designate
that like them like i don't know how you do it but they have a formula for for verifying that it is like spam and it it sends them to another folder
so ha i those works i'm not going to say that it works so well ninety percent of the time
me my name is aodri and im in new york
yes
yes mm i believe
i believe that the majority of the the services of the mail technicians have that now because it is like an invasion because and they try in any case to put
words as if it were a conversation and it is not just in english because i am going to tell you that
i also receive a lot in spanish eh
my personal mail and my mail also at work and i get a lot a lot a lot
then you have never bought anything through spam
not i no not i but i remember that it might be a year now i read a newspaper article about a man who
yes and he loves to buy stuff silly stuff
he lives from that and i but i must say that i never got to know someone that
no im peruvian
that bought that spam because to everyone they they get little anger when they see that holy spam and this the other and i
yes
yes it is bad taste
yes yes you know one thing
probably there is a reason to have a think like that and spend the money because eh
yes yes
no but you know what i always say i say someone has to be buying this for them to send it as they send it
and and they have put laws in place like that in the state of virginia is illegal
sending spam an unsolicited email
but in any case lots arrive horrors arrive
is not the first person don't you worry
it is also like for example the ones who dial the phone ah ay that i that makes me go crazy when i see
yes
no no no no i am not so sweet with them no no no i tell them no that what do they do with my name take my name out immediately
so there is something i don't know if it is federal but i know that in the state yes what was done is that our governor and that is it gives you a cover
and that you can you can place your name and if someone calls you they have to to pay a fine because it says they shouldn't call you
yes i i have my boss my ex boss what he did when they called him from one of those cards to have a drawing on the house what do i know
eh from the mortgage he said wait a moment and he would leave them waiting because he said look when i have to talk with customer service for anything the credit card the bank what do i know
they always put me on hold for a long time so i love telling them
wait he loves to do that
oh
but tell me
yes
yes
ah ok ok
yes
yes
yes
you're right not always the case but no not gon na lie to say no i'm always there no no oh i want
it is the same thing especially when i call my mobile phone say ah
in middle of the day or sometimes at work or i don't know look i have many things to do
no what for you are swelling the balls
odri
well you know its a kind of long story well first i was born here my parents are from peru but also my parents were left
well very young from their country then
neither of my parents leave peruanos even my grandmother has not my grandfather hadn't either
oh my grandfather lived in argentina for a decade
he was very sticky to take the argentina culture and everything else
and yes so my mom has a little of him
and well i have i have a more stronger but even i work for an argentinian stadium
then thanks to them it stick me but not is stadium legal
aodri
yes yes exactly exactly
good what do you think about the mail no requested
hello good
music was playing while she threw a plate on the floor and we are trying to
sorry
ah but you know we spend all day listening to music
classic or you know playing or whatever we listen to it in english and in spanish
so that when his dad is home we only speak english
but when he goes to work we only speak in spanish
yeah so and you
oh
oh
hmmm hmm
my name is anni and i'm calling from miami
hmmm hmmm
hmm mm
yes
aha
hmm mm
yes
hmm mm hm mm we
well we had a
not a bad time but my daughter still only two months ago started to sleep during night time for the whole time
but when she was seven for eight years we took her with us in the bed
hello
the cradle of her and i could not it was very difficult to make her sleep and finally discovered tat if i put some music with a sound machine
you know that she sleeps well and now eh we bought her an ipod
because ehm what i do is that i have you know one month and like one hundredsomething cds
then i i can choose what i would like her to hear usually when we put her to sleep
we take you know what what the nursery the nursery rhymes i think that's what they are called
then ehm i ehm i turn on the music i turn on the the the sound machine
well we read her a few books and already she already knows that when she hears that you know she she starts to sleep she sleeps better i ehm already i put her to sleep on the crib and like in that five minutes she already is
sleeping yes and that for e and for that reason was that on of the reasons that we bought the the ipod
because also when we are in the car she wants her songs and w whatever and for one to take you know to take five hundred something _cds have then in the car
and but she is also one one well is not she sometimes ehm she is a baby model
okay
then we bought her the ipod with the money that she
she does it herself you know
that she does it the same in work
yes yes
we did it in good part because her and part mine because i have my music there too so you know
yes so that
well probably ninety percent is her
and you know because if we are in a place or wherever because her car too
it has a headset
and when we buy it i thought who its going to put you know a walkman o something and now i am doing
hm mm i'm i'm coming out
yes so do i
hmmm
don't worry i understood
yes
no but figure out that we are having our next baby
if god wants in o week from now
and you know that's what we are doing we are going to a maternity center right here and that's hat we are going to do
because you know for mi my first birth experience was a csection and
and it wasn't because i wanted it was an amergency
but i believe that okay
yes no it's not important
that's okay so then
you know so then we are going to do that and with her she can't see anything of television
you know uh many times when we go to church and they are taught you know the cartoons elmo
or whatever she just looks at me like what is that yes people look at me like how can she not know who is elmo and i well since we do not watch television
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
music
well and also you know i since we are going to have the baby i was thinking that we are going to put it to
not to watch television but for i was looking to see what programs i could let her see that are educational but
yes but i i still couldn't
yes but
what what happens to me is that that i know that television i am not going to have ay problems eh to interest her
and that i prefer yes i can until at least she is three or four years old
that she pursues her love for books and music and all that i'd prefer you know that we continue on with that i don't know
yea when the ba the baby arrived that that i'm going to feel like being able to put to have a bit of time you know
what i'd most like to do if i do it it'd be for half an hour a day and it'd be a program that i know that
you know is educational
ah music eh we spent the whole day listening to music i have a girl of twenty three months
but als
well the the most difficult thing we have is that no we don't watch a lot of tv
but and if you go in to you to our our house you'd think we watch a lot of tv with because our house uh it has a
it had those fifty two inch tvs
so also in past christmases we'd bought a tivo
then we record the old movies and programs that interest us but
but this is nothing we never watch abc nbc nothing of those
always is the discovery channel pr something like this like the history channel
but for this reason is why i don't want she watch television my husband is watching less television
because when he is in home and she is awake we don't open it
and no i do not let her watch tv but i have always
so that was one of the difficulties that we still have becuse as you know he understand that i do not want her to watch the television
but he don't understand if he is watching television she is also watching
okay
hello
uh hmm
oh yes
oh okay okay
is like give her permision
that's the problem i have with mine i told him that i also don't watch television i watch it in my dorm
oh okay
no it's ok don't worry about it
hmmm
oh okay
hmmm
oh ok ok i understand
ah well my uh normall i i i listen to all kinds of music
no i don't have a favorite i like to listen to anything even music in another language
um and yes i can spend a whole day listening to music because like they say music is calming
good ah my name is jenny and i'm calling from new york
even the most ferocious animal uh uh uh um i think he's calmed too i know in the moment when i work from home
and working in the court too so when i'm not in the court discussing something i'm at home and in those moments that you feel more agitated
ah it's the best moment to start the radio and hear something to calm one and put it back in the
in the thinking mode that you should be um right now no i don't have kids but um it lasted a few years working in a pre care
and that was the best when one wanted to
a class of eighteen 4 year old kids to calm down
puts a a music ah classical
and how that changes the room's overall mood because if it affects the sense of the human animal so to speak
so hm mm
oh okay
ah okay hello
hmm mm
hm mm hm mm
okay
hm mm
hm mm
i see
hm mm
wow so you already have her in the routine
hm mm
oh yes it is better to take the ipod than
um can hold just a moment there is a call on the other line that i need to take immediately
hm mm
oh
ok
so more or less like the vagrancy of her they do
oh well thas a good idea
well how not its not going to be the music of her only
oh oh that's not thats not the way the things are
oh wow
mmm
yes
okay
no that's the better because i tell my point of view of a person that was a teacher
the music is parents cultivate the love for music to their kids is like teach them how to read
because it helps in concentration the movements if you watch a kid when he is listening piano music
they pretend to be playing with their little fingers all that helps
for the development i forgot how to say development in spanish
oh development the development of the kid is doing great i always thought that i always told my husband when we will have children
there are some things that you are going to think to be kind of crazy i said him that i want to
i want to give birth in a bathroom with water and music he said that i was kind of crazy
hm mmm
oh wow
hello
ohh yeah
oh
oh excuse my shhh it's my dog quiet
i'm sorry
yea
that is the best yeah
hm mm
no that is is the best method that can assure the success of your child eh to keep him/her away from that that is the problem with my husband
well i say because him his mother was a little weird because she taught him let him be in front of the television all the time
and i don't know i had a television until i was thirteen years old my mother and father would not buy a television we had nothing of that only he finds it weird
sorry ah what was the subject of this call
i was always did well in school in the school system i was always in advance i finished the university early he has waited for me all that i have done i have done it fast
and with ease and he i don't know i always tell him because i did not have any distractions i did not have a television to take away one or two hours
from school you know everything was always was focused yes my mother and father we were poor but yes one of us wanted to play music and my father and mother did whatever they could to take music lessons
you know if we were interested in animal we would go to the museum
on the weekends o you know there was always something of education so you grow up in little time or rather when you are eh a teenager
grow and and you see the difference and from your friends that know this that know about that
and you feel weird but then when he is more more mature now i see and i say thank you i tell my mom dad always thank you very much because now
i can buy that thing that i want yes i want an ipod i buy it i have one
yes i want uh a playstation we have it there it just collects dust
because we don't play i have no interest and my husband says you are not going to sit to play i don't want to play with that either
ah okay good let's start yes yes you want to start
so it is there but also i see the benefit that i didn't waste my youth
hm mm
well nowadays there are many programs
according no there are there are many uh they have uh on channel thirteen they have like two that are alright two that have the approval of of the school system here
in new york
hm mm
hm mm
no
hm mm yea
well i i've got con i don't know you but i'm sure it'll be a great job because for how i'm hearing you talk about it
oh okay
it's everything that in my mind i'd see and i'd say ok this is what i want to do this is what i want to see and when i talk with my husband he ah
i don't know i don't know but
but you it's i'm listening to you and i realize it's good you know that everything you're saying is perfect no no there's nothing
that i'd do differently like who says
hm mm
oh my goodness okay
okay
hm mm hm mm
oh yes this is the best
yeah al right
hello
mmm are you at home or at the hospital
so then
mhm
yes and no that is the problem yes

and he told me to grab it and cut the call because that one will not count
then he sent an email to everyone saying that if you talked to a non spanish speaker or english speaker

oh
yes i like to wake up to music then my alarm is also is is a player then when the alarm in the morning instead of being on of those sounds that
gives you a heart attack
it is it is the music that it has there inside the player then like that it is fine because one wakes up little by little
aha
when i arrived here in houston i would go out a lot to dance salsa
yes
yes i found a group of people over there where ivent to school that would dance salsa and i went out a lot but not anymore now i don't have any time to go out anywhere
but afterwards i did not i like i got tired of going out because i had already gone to all of the same places and you see the same people and
always the places were but very full of people then youvent to dance and it was almost impossible to dance and people would step on you or would hit you when they were doing turns then no i already i i got tired of that
besides that you must pay so much to get into the places
it costs ten or fifteen dollars to enter the places so then no not any more like now i prefer if i go out i prefer to go to a place that is more peaceful
yes just is there and talk and
mhm
yeah
wow but they groups groups that are well known or yeah
wow but because is is that you live in very large city
hello
at home the day after we left the hospital the day after he was born
i don't go out anymore it is to much trouble ok
ah i thought the call was dropped
everything went well not i we were just after he was born the delivery twentyfour hours and that was all
yes
every two yours you have to feed it
well they are giving him ah breast milk
so you don't have to go around worrying about preparing milk or anything
it is fine no that nothing for anything i wake up just one or two times but not more to be with them there
that's how it is
yes
ah yes
oh i'm manuel from chicago
how come how come she hasn't said anything about that
oral
yes
okay
yes and got one of those emails too
yes yes he commented something like that but ah i he didn't told me he will be giving out right from there he told me that
he thought it was for her
ah
how are yo
ah
yes she speaks well
it is she is funny you get in the car of hers ah she brings a van a caravan
at once to me i found it weird i went up and brings one when i was there in nebraska with them
uh i've been using it a few days and i grabbed the box which has all the cds
i said it to see if by chance he brings music in spanish
here then you will not believe they brought sixty or seventy cds
all in spanish and then i asked him hey jenny i say you get that as you bring music in spanish i say why not bring in spanish no he says i like to hear pure spanish if i do not like it in english
oh i said okay
yes she knows everything i do not know how long i have to practice spanish or spanish speaking but he speaks very well
fine fine
ah what happens is that she had the boy from before
but they have like i am not sure approximately four years
three or four years
yeah and she had she has children from a previous marriage
ah they have a daughter only
by my brother
yes
ah yes one one of them competes in wrestling
but you know wherever you go you are going to find good and bad people
yes
excuse me
yes of that yes i realized they're not so i think that where it's a town where there aren't many hispanics it's better than not having any
and you know in where there are many hispanics there are many well now they start the bad friendships and all that the bad people
then the americans now start to see badly now no to to him
that is to a hispanic they start to see that they're all the same they think
and like there there aren't no they don't have
yes they don't think that one is mexican this one isn't going to do this he's not going to do the other
no n i think there haven't they haven't had experience with many mexicans
and m therefore there aren't they haven't the mexicans have not well there isn't anyone who commits evil deeds
now since the mexicans have a party one or two o'clock in the morning and the music and all that and so
yes nothing beyond that up to now immediatly after a while more hispanics should begin to arrive
i'm dad again
yeah
texan music
i like it a lot i lived a lot ah i lived good times here in texas i like it a lot like the texmex what do you say
all this music
and yet here almost at times i don't find discos like this i search for them but here the people they do not listen to much they do not hear a lot of it
then no but yes sometimes when my brothers come or i go to them i bring music from here
i like the northern music usually the northern
yes like the traditional one but like mariachi and all like those almost no bands also
yes
oh what kind i like to listen to
no everything was fine
i like to listen to colombian very much
yes music like there are many
yes like many yes many cumb yes like very mellow music no
not very strong
yeah i carry in my car i always carry music and if someone gets in i raise the volume no i like to listen to it but very softly only softly
only to like ca like music relaxes me sometimes
yes
yes
no that's good at least for me i don't like it so much
yes over there people that can't can't sleep oh my brother the one that lives in nebraska
right now is like 5 minutes ago i was holding my baby in my arms
he there was a time where he would fall asleep and if he didn't have music he wouldn't go to sleep
and i would tell him turn off the radio already you can not sleep without music not without without music one can not sleep well he said i wake up and i wake u happy i fall asleep and i fall asleep happy
each one
yes
yes
and you go you get out there in i don't know dances or discos in texas
yes
aha
ye
like that
but they took him away for eat
oh
here there is a dancing hall where mexican groups come
like northern and all that
you are not going to believe they charge fifty dollars the ticket
yeah yes yes groups yes and even like that people stay outside that don't get to come in
yes
i went one time and i did like it because is beautiful
what happens is that you can't even walk
since they are they bring groups oh good mexican groups everyone wants to listen to them
the room has capacity for four thousand people and that was the only time i went i don't like to go anymore
good evening
no yes
what's up it doesn't say i don't know
ah yes
and after twenty or so they don't call anymore right
ah that's good
ok i better get on it and start calling then
of course
ah ok and every day it is different
ah five days in a row
ah
sure
i'm over there no
sure
ah
me yeah yes i listened to music too but ah i also listen but a lot there was a lot of time i stopped listening to music and started listening
problems conversational programs
political
but it's like someone after a lot of time you get used to this and forget to listen to music and you spend days without listening to music
and then you realize that your music i mean music really changes you changes your mood
for for the rest of the day doesn't it
so now i started listening more music for to have more will more energy
because i don't know of the latin blood i guess
and you are from from ah where did you say you were from from
but one needs
needs that you know that kind of dancing music
yes because i almost don't listen that kind of music here
right
no i like all kind today
before when i was in chile i didn't like the salsa neither merengue nothing like that now that i'm here i love it
now the only thing i need is to learn how to dance no more but i love it
no nothing here nothing about latino neither merengue nothing here
no because here are just a few latinos
most of them here are mexicans
puerto rico
but on tv on the radio there's nothing in spanish nothing latino
on the tv no nothing
no nothing
so we're in the middle of nowhere
yes it's boring
boring when i went to california to visit it was
and how long have you been here
oh long time
i am i've been living here ten years this year
it doesn't seem like it yet but long time no
is beginning to get cold but no not as much as chicago
yes
cristina i am from chile and i am in idaho
oh yes i've heard that is terrible terrible
my brotherinlaw lives in chicago also
yes ahm i don't know because i don't i didn't see how they lived but he goes to the university of chicago
and i believe that they live around there close by maybe the university apartments surely
so i don't know where
yes about music
and what mu well being from puerto rico what music do you like
bachata what is bachata
aha
ah yes
how are you
yes yes i have heard some yes
and of and of so living in chicago has not caused you to maintain the music that you listened to there in puerto rico no
why so many
why no there is a lot there is a lot of variety that is there is a lot of variety in chicago
so you haven't missed it much
how great
of course
of course
right
ah yes yes yes
are you in chicago no
ah yummy
ah what
ah really
yes here in idaho no one comes
no
ay that's so cool
yeah
then you don't feel so far away from your place of origin right
you have all that
yeah here in idaho they there's nothing here the only music we have here is more like mexican like
oh
i don't know how it's called but it is like  saltaditas or i don't know how it will be
but it is music that i have never heard not even over there in chile
and of course over there in chile one listens ore to music i don't know how boleros also and
things like that but of course here you miss it because it is not heard to it is not heard much about that and nobody comes around here either so one doesn't have with
tru
e or any of that and yes i missed it so much that i am listening right now the satellite radio
and with that i have been able i have been able to remember now many things in spanish because after ten years finally i would be listining to songs that are being played now
that which is the reggaeton and all of that
i did not have an idea about that because it has been about ten years that i did not listen to music in spanish
and it is music in spanish
and what time is there
oh terrific
uh huh
of course
of course
yes it's good it's good to have music in spanish because
because the english is lovely but it's not the same
but it isn't what you've grown up with or anything like that eh
yes i now i'm happy with with being able to hear music in spanish again because really it makes a difference
in the soul and all that
for getting to see
what time is over there
of course
aha
clear
and give more encouragement no
instead of an upset because i'd be waiting so at least you dance while no
yes
really
really
me
two with it
uhh late
yes
wow then you call i was waiting for them to call me
then you can call and wait
ah then you can speak more than once in a day
once a day
yes the other time i spoke with my sister because we called both at the same time
and my sister lives in atlanta in georgia
and i speak with her she is the one recording for this program when you listen that girl speak and telling what to do and all that
she she's my sister
then when she made the recording she told me to call and be able to listen and speak with her it was the only time i did it and from that moment i didn't spoke with her ever
here is nine o'clock
so this is my first time speaking with someone else
yeah so i sharpened up and that's why i called because i was waiting for someone to call me but nothing happened
right
it's scary right
oh yeah
oh
sure
oh i see
no i like the music subject it's simpler the other time when it was a subject right i think it was about immigration
that's kinda scarier than speaking about politics and immigration because
good evening
at night
yeah
oh yeah yeah i also talked
aha
about about politics i don't like it but i talked about immigration about music about marriage i talked
about cell phones well a lot imagine i still need like nine nothing more i still need thanks to god
after twenty or so then you wait two or three months they send you the check to you rhome
yes
yes after five in the afternoon you can call who you can ah i mean you dial the phone that is there
that you have to call and there you communicate but they have to be after five in the afternoon because at that time it is that they change the
the the subject they are talking about the subject
wow
well the other time i talked like five times about marketing ah i talked five times
i spoke one now with this two about music i talked three about marriage i talked just one about cell phones well many subjects
but but they have not changed them but now that that they put a lady talking well they have changed the topics
but first you have you had to talk well a lot of a lot the topics say ah almost always they left the same topics so that people talked
look then ah
you ah when you're driving do you listen to music or not
aham
aham
aham aham
aham
wow

that who have sang that music music very and alejandra alex bueno i always i grab ah cds from the library
okey good evening
to listen to them i also like reggae i don't know if you listen to reggaeton it is in vogue now
from  daddy yanky  don omar  tengo calderon ivi queen
no it's not almost
almost the same
right right
no no no
there in puerto rico i listened to los boleros and salsa but i don't really like boleros that much and salsa either because they are not music you can dance to
they are more romantic
i do a lot but we use the merengue a lot
such as olga tañon elvis crespo
good
a here in chicago they do a lot ah puerto rican parade
and they get invited they get invited this year was  ivi queen she's the the the the regaetton babe
in 2004 elvis came
crespo
yes then
no
here they have a boricua party in september and they brought tego calderón ah they always have a lot of concerts at the parks outdoors
and they're free they come a lot they ah they do something that says  viva chicago
and they bring music from colombia mexico everywhere puerto the the world
yeah yeah yeah
thank you ahh a little bit call and a litltle hot
yeah
yeah
aha
no
aha
aha aja
aha
aha aha
ohh because now the here in chicago we have a station that is ni nehundred three point one fm
that sings reggaeton the whole damn day
hmm
aha so especially when one is on the car driving
that you don't get bored because you put the the radio at full volume and and the ride does
very quickly and you don't get bored you don't sleep in the car or anything
listening to music
uh huh
no no
uh huh uh huh uh huh
uh huh
it's like that music that i don't know if you are listening heard the music that they have eh ah when they are one is waiting for a person
who put the phone on hold to speak i don't like that music because eh ah it's music like of like classical and it's music like when you are going
aha
like when you are going on the elevator
you have music of for me for me
beautiful and should not change it to music merengue or bachata ah or music
ah like like cumbias cumbias that are nice
aha aha aha
aha aha aha no is that one falls asleep waiting
i was looking right now waiting for fifteen minutes so that i could communicate to
yeah last time i waited half an hour and when i was going to communicate with someone for allegedly hanged at eleven pm
is hanging and calls
aha aha aha
is is ten thirty three
many times have you spoken
oh yeah and i wear with it
is thirteen
aha
no no if they don't call you can call them after 5 pm you can call anyone but only after 5
anyone you want
no no only once
yes
aha
ohh
and there
aha aha
ohh
oh
¡oh lord you still have a lot yeah you have to do twenty three more
because because the last time it was politics
but i called and nobody picked picked up the phone no one nobody
but right but i they call me every afternoon around five o pm somebody here that that
that if i want to pick up the phone to talk but since i don't pick up the phone i don't know what they're talking about
how is the music this is the second time i call i
i have spoken to a lot of people from nebraska from philadelphia from miami
one time yes it is me tammy again find and you oh my god
because the can not have all of the and that is bad because if they don't take things like they are supposed to take them
they will not help you so that is scary
yes that is mija from welfare
mja assistance they give her for them here they do not give you a lot so it is hard have to prove show them that it is real
you have that but anyway and if you do what do what feels and you are working
and if you do not know they will not pay well but you they pay twenty dollars or a little more then twenty dollars from the
or i believe les then twenty dollars from the limit they give you they do not help
i say they are twenty dollars more then the limit they have but i say is not that much
and they do not want that they prefer that you do not work
to be able for them to help but with the help they give you it is not enough for you to survive
no yes here well i think that some things are good but other things no
no then that is what you feel maybe well they can not will not help you
they do not want to help because you make a lot supposely it is not that much you can not survive with that and you would have to stop working for them to help
it's not much right so it's hard it's very hard for people to try that i think i can imagine that's why there's people that work under the table
because they can't say they're working because then they don't help you and they don't have enough and if you have children well that's another thing
no no so i was watching my son my crazy kid he comes here to my house and says to me hey mom why don't you want to apply for the government to get sandwiches
i say hey we do to much to get sandwiches and i think i give you to buy sandwiches i give you money
four children wait until four people in the house want you to make like twenty four thousand dollars
that's not enough a year that's not enough
not for four people specially if within those people is a baby
because that i say that's a lie i was showing my husband and i tell him  those people are crazy who's gon na make i mean where you work and where you live because here where i live
especially the of older people they don't don't give them enough money or or it is not about the money but that they need medical assistance they don't pay totally for the pills
yeah what a miracle that when my son when he moved he found an apartment near us that was seven hundred and twenty five a month and that's cheap
right no it didn't include any of that so you can imagine if with two
so i say that if a person who has four people at home and makes twentyfour thousand can not can not
so for me that's why i always talk to my children be careful work take care of your credit and save your money
because what do you think you remember i talked to you yesterday
my sone is back the older one moved he is at my home again he fought with his girlfriend and the girl did something bad to him and this man my son when you do something bad to him he says goodbye and like that you never see him again
so he took everything my husband went there and took all his things and now there is nothing of his in that apartment
now he went
aha very bad that this man got like that he called me mom well and i tell him i support you so come here here i am going to convince him to go to school because
yes he was but now he is i want well he can go eh eh people at work told him that he can go to school in the morning
so it is more difficult for them ehm you know to take their pills because they have to think that i have to pay the pills or i have to eat
and work after so they help him so i tell him well i say if you move here if you go to school and i don't charge you rent
but if you don't want to go to school you are going to have to pay rent because i want him to finish school
because it is going to i mean too many things especially with him if he does not want to finish school it is going to be difficult to achieve things so i want
mja so yes yes because that is what i tell him because then something happens and you don't do you feel you are going to end up asking help and you are not going to have you are a man i say no
it is not need it is so young but not finish things having us here we can help him and he doesn't want to accept it
i always give him the example of the people we know look you don't want to end up there work hard
mm no yes and how is it there in canada with the with this of of insurance
mja
aha mja aha
aha
because they have to pay more and sometimes too sometimes there are people that abuse i knom people that well they are no my friends for but i know that they have been abusing
aha
no yes i don't know i we when my husband went from he was in the air force
then we came here and him neither they pay you as much that was like in ninetytwo
and then when we came here it hadn't been enough to be able to pay the rent so that then we got for a month
for enough to help us and for as much time how long it took him to get work so that it took him a month
well a month to get work but you know the next check then we ook that month and we went out once from there but when one goes to the store with those the the one of these that they give you that like they're false papers
the people you if when you go shopping that that was years so that now i think that they give you a card
but the people look at you badly
uh huh that that yest because no because no because they are giving you help you you see that you can work yes we can work but they didn't have i with two small children i say no i can't work once because where am i going to leave the little children that i have to pay someone and i don't have anything to pay them with
and then i told my husband never ever never
of those uses that real persons that other persons really need
i say that i work wherever before getting into this and i he always has told me that it's low and i don't put my family like this
so because it is like they look at you poorly i say no man because you are asking for a little help
because i things didn't go well or because it is very difficult
aha they don't remember people who don't remember that
but i don't i am not like that when i see people who have needs i say this can happen to anyone it can happen one day it happened to me
so and well ah i say
right well i say they're not stealing it's not like they went crazy and steal they're
they went because they had to and ask for help maybe they didn't even want to but they had to
right
no no uh the what they well they send you a check
i see but it is difficult i have mine sisinlaw my husband's mom
well that was on ninety two that i remember they send you a check and then they send you a book
a little one that had that money like the monopoly kind
and it was like five dollars twenty dollars and you had to get it from there give it to the person and they didn't give you back the change
and you had to try to have the exact thing because well i mean no it's just
right and then i had to they wanted to be sure you didn't use it for alcohol so that looks bad i mean they should i think that now with that card thing they have
and she is partially on assistance but no they don't help her so much and there has to he needs to search coupons and things like that to see if she can buy the medicine in a different place so that it is cheaper or
buy a medicine this month or buy another medicine the other month
betsy hello how are you
aha no
and and that is welfare or pension or
ah o that is yeah i can imagine
mja
mja
ja
now
yeah
but now but they do not pay all the medications that you need
yeah
here sitting down to have what can you tell me about social assistance or about whatever because i don't have an idea
and the help they give you it's not enough there's still
right right
yeah but after you're eighteen they don't help you anymore when your children are eighteen years old they don't help you anymore
uh
right
right
twenty four thousand dollars a year oh my goodness for four people no
right
right
yeah but that doesn't include utilities
aha aha
aha oh ok more expensive
it is not enough
ok that they don't spend on things they don't need
yes aha you already came back
boy
wow
that girl must have done something really bad to him mm
because yes already and when he moved in with his girlfriend he wasn't working oh aha
aha
ok that is good aha
oh
ok of course mja
mja or have a good career also they are not going to send him to mcdonald's to work forever
mja
mja
no he doesn't want to because he doesn't want to have that the government won't even doesn't even help him at all
well here they make you work i when we just got here ahh just arrived from el salvador which was fifteen years ago they gave us a they rented an apartment for us they gave us a
bed and furniture and that but and we were on welfare
for a few months from there because we went to school and there my parents got a job and my brother and i were in high school
and from there but from there since my parents were working this and they helped him my brother because my brother was fifteen years old i think
and i ok and i was already eighteen they did no longer help him just for my brother but i went into high school and i didn't work until until when
aha oh
yes but they put me in in the welfare sometimes i got into it but i believe that here they help you a little bit more because they give you a medicine card
mja and this and has to display in the shop where one goes shopping for medicine and and they pla pay well that was the last time that i asked for assistance
but now ah now i don't know how it will be it must be harder
uh huh mja

because what doesn´t doesn´t affect here not only the temperature
but humidity so we have normally i think that about seventy eigh eighty percent of of of humidity
and when you leave the house
you know as soon as you leave you start sweating because it´s like if somebody is giving you a a wet blanket
it´s very you know very sticky and
but now we´re getting in in the time that is not so so bad it´s hot but humidity low ve
but you know how for example i can wash my hair
ah
uh and i can be the whole night with wet hair
because it doesn't get dry because there is so much humidity
and especially if i wash it in the morning and go out and i have it in a in a ponytail in a ponytail
my hair stays wet the whole day
so you know it is always n not so much the heat as much as the humidity i think
so and is it cold over there or not yet
wow
and when you ehm usually have snow
when do you usually starts to snow the time of the year with snow and all of that
so ehm but when does it start to snow
ah no i've never been
because i thought that that it snowed in new york
didn't you tell me that you are eh that you live in new york
okay
i thin okay
okay i was thinking that it was snowing in new york that's why i asked you
oh sorry
no no eh my parents are from the dominican republic
but i was born in puerto rico
and my father too
and puerto ricans too
ah twentysomething
mhm
mhm
uh huh from haiti
yes from haiti
from haiti
from jamaica
i don't think so i mean we have a house but my husband is the only one who works and we have to you know
no we don't have a luxurious life
um we have enough money for what we need to buy food pampers
you know pay the the the light bill whatever but we don't have don't have anything for vacations you know nothing like that
wow
we have what you need but
you know and nothing else have a car we have two cars and here usually people have
two cars
no no we only have one car
no we have a house right here it's a small house
eh we have three bedrooms
and two bathrooms it's not very big the houses are very expensive here
so you know we only have the necessities
but it's not a luxurious life
and we do not have you know we're not starving and no we do not lack clothes
so you were born in new york
but since i'm not working i keep my daughter with me
we find it difficult
am i believe so we look i
and you know we save lotsnof money but i don't go to the stores i don't buy many things you know i don't go
no shopping because the the clothing is very espensive
really we buy clothes regularity let see when we can go to cotsco
o o sams or somrthing like that
and we see something that is our size and we will buy it
but i go to the store no no i don't do that what
you know and this i don't care because you know i yes yes i had clothes to wear i don't care brand names or what
hello
yes oh well yes uh mm yes we have to talk about traveling what places have you traveled to
because it is it is three trips three flights or rather i have i have no money left to go to any other place then i believe that after i finish school i will take
free time on vacation before i start i start working to
yes or for and to go somewhere i want to go a different place not to see my family
mhm yes yes and usually when you start working they do not allow you to take a vacation for sometime ah
there are places where during the first three months you can not take any vacations to other the first six months you can not take any vacations
then yes how is your baby
yes yes she's growing
aha aha aha
aha
mhm
yes sure you can go to vacations
ha
yeah
yea yeah otherwise no at first the grow up very fast
too fast i would say until they're at least two they start too i mean until they continue
ok
and oh
but ok
where had you been in united states
ok
mmm
oh
mmm
hi is sulma
ok
oh
mm
mhm
aha
sur
mhm
mhm
but ah what you went to arizona you went to to visit some tourist sites to visit the
yes you went to the grand canyon
hi
uh huh and did you enjoy it
yes yes
of course yes
mm and to mexico you have only gone to see your family or visit other places also
aha
mm
mhm
mmh
mmh
mm
fine and you
and would you like going to another country in the world
alaska
mm
is very cold there
mm
yes my the boss i used to have went to antartic in other words the south pole
yes to see the penguins because the penguins are only in the south pole
and ah she loved it there are cruises you can take to go to alaska you take them from california and they take you to alaska
and then you get to see all the glaciers and all the mm
mm
are you working right now
ah yes no
it costs time and money
yes yes it's difficult no it's it's i li
aha
no no tell what you were going to
sure mhm
mhm
mhm
yes
sure yes it's difficult to balance going to see the family and to go on vacation and even more when you get married because then you have to go to see your family and the
oh
family of your wife or husband
then your time runs out and vacations and the money and all goes it goes there
yeah yeah
um
um yeah right
um
um
sure yeah
yes yes i love travelling i hope that nos that i'm starting to work as a nurse and start having money i cant travel
to the wherever i want to go but yeah i've been in europe and i've been in costa rica and guatemala i've been in mexico but only in mexico city
oh of course yes
in puerto vallarta and in chiapas
oh i was in uh in san cristóbal and uh where else was i in chiapas uh i don't remember but uh and i was in taxco too when i was
yeah when i was in mexicano
oh yeah yeah i have a friend that loves to travel she loves staying in different countries shes currently stayed two years in
in taiwan and when i saw her in mexico she had already been six months in mexico so she had already been through the entire country
and when i found her she was in chiapas so then we went to san cristobal and guajaca then we went to taxco and came back um
i came back she stayed
oh from the city of mexico she was studying
she was studying so she took some classes for an independent study while she was studying and taking classes she was traveling through mexico
yeah yeah so then when i went travelling with her i didn't really spend much because we stayed at hostels i don't remember how you guys call them
a break huh
but i mean like you can stay so you stay and sleep with a lot of people in the same room right but we didn't really pat much we payed like
two or three dollars a night
but most of them are students so you have to share with people you don't know
no yeah they're people that
you are doing the same thing
yes come to travel and who wants to spend such little money so then that was fine but i also went to europe and i stayed there for a month also
traveling in europe but it was quite expensive but my parents helped me because it was my graduation present from college but after that i was here in houston
i've only been to aruba which is on the north coast of venezuela
aha that is it is a small island like puerto rico but i did not like it a it is a pretty famous ah tourist site in the caribbean there but i did not like it
because puerto rico is also an island and puerto rico is much greener and there are mountains and this little island aruba is a desert there is nothing there
fine fine you work in construction you had said right
absolutely nothing the only thing is that the beaches are very nice but apart from the beaches there is nothing more to do
in aruba yes
yes it is dry there is nothing absolutely nothing as it is quite plain and there are only stones ah that's all it is all rocky eh the
there are rocky beaches also
yes the sand is white and the water is very clearly and you can see can see through water it is very light blue
but but there is nothing more to do absolutely nothing else
so then i did not like it but why yes all of my family is in puerto rico except that i have a sister living in florida
the the rest are in puerto rico but nevertheless and now for example this year i went to see my sister in florida and then in august
and then i went to puerto rico to see my family and in december i will be going to canada to see my boyfriend's family
so then i have no time or money to go anywhere else
hi
mm the the the best that you can do right
ok yes to mexico
nothing else to mexico and here in the united states i have to go to different parts
ahh from vacations not to work from vacations
heh
in texas
when i was in texas traveled from there to here
i have family here and there
now i'm travel here i'm going there or nebraska with my brother he is there
i have family in arizona too all my uncles
oh i am manuel from
almost every part of my mom family is here in the united states
furthermore in different states or i have another in wisconsin i go over also sometimes
yeah that's close by
and well what can i tell you when you have time to travel i prefer to do it by car driving here
because you can stop and rest whenever you like
and when when you're with the family you have to stop to rest
if you go by bus you may only stop once and it's very uncomfortable
and yeah that's all
yeah grand canyon
yes
chicago how are you
oh yes it's beautiful
it is very pretty though it is like very well it is a desert area actually
but it has many very pretty things
well i have family in two states in durango and in monterrey
ah monterrey has ah it is it is like what i tell you well no they have many places like touristic where to go for a stroll eh to see
it is an industrial city there are many well i'll tell you there are many things with which you can there are not there are things like that but it is very pretty
it has they are two like i don't know exactly what they are like rivers one is called horse tail
they are lika huge waterfalls very high
what e many people visit it from different parts to
it is very pretty
fine fine working
oh yes i would like to see alaska
yes
go to see how it is
eh what exactly the true definition of cold weather
i would like to be over there
yes
yes
yes yes i knew about that
yes yes i would really like to go there
but sometimes there's no time
yes
and when
wh when you have time sometimes you don't have money
what what happens is that
hello yes tell me
oh what happens is that let me tell you like when you go on vacation one what well at least i ah eh i try to
go out but where my family is go to visit my family some times ah
it's tough two or three years without seeing them
if you have an opportunity well i prefer of course to see my family traveling as well i don't know
eh we are like we are very close we see each other a lot
and better there are times in which we have to travel we better make plans to go and see the family better
yes i just saw the call and i thought well entertain my self for a few rest a little while
oh speaking about that's another problem
yeah well mostly time because the uh let me tell you that i don't spend much money when you go to see the family you don't spend as much as when you go to
i don't know when you go on vacation to know different uh cities or countries
there you do spend a lot because you have to pay for hotels food
and obviously you go out wherever you go you're spending money
when going out with the to visit the family you do spend i won't say you don't but
you don't spend as much
it's very different
that's good
oh yeah
eh
oh taxco
vacations
yeah me with vacations
oh
mm that's good
mm
but like you know you're safe there's no danger only over there
these are
ah exactly people doing the same thing
okay
how are you
there is desert
yes
yes
look
mm
well yeah
to rest
well that is good because once you start working if you are barely starting you do not know exactly how you are going to have well it will practically change your rhythm in life no
mhm
you see
yes
oh very well thank you
yes that's good growing growing since the day she was born she was born on wednesday on saturday she had an appointment with the pediatrician we took her
and she had grown nearly a pound
uh the doctor was talking to us right and we are talking for a while he was telling us well its good hes gotten fatter because
when they are born the regular thing to do is to make them loose weight
and and this girl didn't lose it on the contrary she gained weight
that's very good
mm i hope she stays that way i don't want no problems
yeah
oh betsy are you talking to alex again how are you
and to gibraltar and i loved it but the south of spain where the beaches are
they robbed me on on the subway train
and they took my wallet
and they stole me like i don't know a hundred bucks
yeah or maybe more what in spain
and in colombia where where that it's so famous about that gangster's
thieves it never happened to me because it is one of the reasons that i was always more aware
and in spain when you are aware
yes yes and and and also you know that a while ago there was a terrorism act there
yes some trains exploited they put some bombs and there were people who it was they were arab terrorism
and people died in spain and this happened in the stations where i was
uh they were beautiful sceneries
a few years ago i was in those places where the acts occured
about a year ago
yes then well you know that if something bad is going to happen to you
something bad is going to happen no no matter where you are
but i didn't have the money to stay for long
and that always frustrated me and then if i got a prize and had the money
and also the time and sure when one has money then one has to have time as well
and then i'd love to travel to spain and visit the
there are a lot of castles and interesting things there
and a lot of things from from from the old world a lot of roman things oh it's interesting it's it's knowing history
but uhm you need money it's it's a expensive country especially for meandering
yeah and no no it's not dangerous where i'm from colombia it's very dangerous
good yeah well the theme about the trip
you do not enjoy it even though it is a beautiful country
one always fears the security of the country
no spain is better
dangerous
yes
colombia is also a fantastic country if there were no war and
you have landscapes and tremendous mountains
yes and we have the seaside there too but the problem is the war and the
and ah the drug trafficking that has totally damaged that country and the image they have i imagine is horrible
yes ah what else within the united states where would you like to go or within canada
yea very interesting
yes i had been told that is nice but cold
yes
where you live
and snow falls
impossible
you are at the north never fall snow
yes
cause here in los angeles never falls snow only on the mountains
yes
but should fall because you're at north betsy
yeah i've had a lot of different opinions
yes you are close to alaska
yes close to seatle washington
do you know seattle washington
i would like to get to know it around there
yes
it has beautiful things museums history i like everything that has to do with history and and the a classic city is montreal canada
they say that canada is very beautiful
and no there is not insecurity like here in the united states
here in the united states it is ugly
it is almost almost like the latin countries now
well do you want to start this time
yes that's why they critic here immigration because migration is too much here it is a bad kind of migration
and it has damaged the country a lot
throughout the years i have seen that this country has really fallen and now in the united states there is a lot of difference between the poor and the rich
which was not the case before in canada i think there is more balance
there are there is not so much difference between the poor and the rich in canada like there is here in the united states
but there are more prograsocial programs there
and there are not as many people the problem here is that there are too many people
yes the country has done down unfortunately yes a lot ahh
yes and it is dangerous
they might steal from you they might do something to you there is a lot of misery it is almost like a latin country i don't see the difference anymore
and why
and you know if the latin countries are known by the difference between rich and poor
and that is this so the us is becoming
yes but there is no interesting things and once i went to texas and i liked the scenery i
i've always liked the colombian plains
super hot but very nice
and the plains of texas are similar a little more developed and ah i like their steaks
and bought a lot of roasted meat from different places
is interesting to me would like to know more about texas
the landscape the plains most of all i love the flat plain i like the banker
and the foreign bbqs
is your husband from canada
i love barbecues asados as they call them in colombia
and you find a lot of that in texas
yes yes i think that one of the more interesting parts of the united states and in seattle i would like to know because of its coffee they say there is good coffee there
yes yes
there are volcanoes there yes
yes i remember and there must be beautiful views there
there is safety
yes that is the problem of all latin countries that that they have never been able to overcome
yes i hope that one day they can do it
yes yes but and i have heard that the views there are beautiful because there are many volcanoes
a cruise would be fantastic
and the mountains do you know the beaches of salvador how are they
what are cobs surfing boards or what
because there is the pacific and the atlantic too yes
how many seas does it have only the pacific
yes
yes
because columbia is near the atlantic and the pacific too colombia has two seas
because of that it's a very nice country it has many beauties and it gets a lot of praieses
as a country it's the worst but it has a lot of beauty
just as it has many queens
well i once went to spain
but there are many bad things
if there are many things i don't deny i can't denied the true
from a situation there are bad things
and not only that there is insecurity
and when you do tourism you don't want to go a place where you can think that something can happen
really you don't want to travel to a place where there is so insecurity
although i'll tell you one thing that its going bury you
i never was steal in colombia
and i told you how i was rob once in spain
yes mrs really
betsy yeah oh hi alezz
i want to go on because i've never been on one ive never been on a cruise ship before what about you
really
that's odd
right
oh no
wow and that was in spain
in spain not in colombia
aha ok
aha
ok mmh ok it is true ok mmh
in spain
ha
aha oh in spain really
oh aha ok
and that happened not long ago

and
in canada ahh i would like to go to montreal
here where we live now the winter is only rain
where we lived before whe winter was a lot of snow and i was super cold
near vancouver
no

hi good evening where are you from
oh a lot and with erm as we talk of travelling have you been to puerto rico
oh yeah
so then ah you haven't always lived in colorado you've travelled or do you only travel on holidays
oh yeah right not much yet just utah and don't know utah and frankly i didn't go to erm washington
to washington of course but not not around around the east side sure one day i hope i can no
oh to study
we moved after i graduated from from school to to study here at university
ah well i moved to utha and there i met my husband and we're now living in idaho
but we've been back to chile just once five years ago and
we expect to be able to return now you know next year maybe
from colorado originally
ah not so much but i think it's more expensive from idaho i think if we were in florida or california i colorado is located in the north right
in the middle ah ok then like way down but around the middle
a then it's easier for you to travel
aha
ah no seriously
oh yes see that's why we're not going anywere because only eh anything is up of three hundred dollars or so by passage it is too expensive
yes did you fly outside america like to europe or something like that or you didn't have the chance
a yes
which country would you like to visit if you could
ah yes to australia
ah i am i am in idaho and am from chile
yes mira if for me if i could choose i think it would be italy
yes i don't know italy yes i think italy but australia is enormous australia there's so much to do
oh
and you of course
oh so you're going to be
of course at least for another five years no
of course when she wants nothing more to do with you for a while no
of course no now it's hard
yes we have little kids too and that makes it so difficult to be able to travel anywhere
or course ah
in the us 10 years in idaho 3
ah then you are going to take her there but at about what age are you thinking of taking her
aha
look then she is constantly
mmh
of course
i imag
of course
oh i imag how old was she
oh tiny she doesn't understand yet of course
ok
yes very much it's like colorado no colorado has a lot of snow
yes that's too much
no but well the people that like because she is going to travel after because there are people that dislike to travel and i cant believe that
that they don't like to travel
true
sure you have to be responsable here because we have children
we have to put our feet in the earth for awhile
i heard about that its super slow
many forest no
and how many years have you lived in colorado
wow
clearly
mhm
mhm
and she was american or where was she from
ah
oh yes
clearly well people change a lot no
in those years
clearly
oh yeah oh and she she's from mexico
right
clearly puerto rico is like that true
um
that's odd yeah it's very sweet
where does she live now
yeah with the girl
oh so you can see her often
oh look that's cool
oh look how good
and it's going to be pretty now when if you're from puerto rico you don't have trouble going in and out of the united states right
i've never understood that what does the united states have to do with puerto ricans its a separate country but at the same time
ha
o but snow like
oh not so long ago
of course
oh
independent
and how much time did you live there
good evening i am joe
oh no never no
oh i spent many years here more than 20 years
actually since erm since ninety three when my parents died it was the last time i went to puerto rico but his i've been to other places i've been to mexico
and i've been yes to other places and places in the us too including florida which is a
one of my favourite places
and on holidays to other states there's a lot to see here i'm not sure you've had a chance to see other places here in the us
but there are many nice places
washington state that's really nice out there
so how did you end up in idaho
ah
i am from colorado
right
that's good
and
and it's very difficult to be coming and going travelling due to passports matters and that kind of things
sure it's in the middle more or less we are way down from where you are
yes it's a center point for flights there are many flights from here to south america too
yes for example if i were going take a vacation in cancún
and it were for three days with about three hundred and fifty dollars
with the hotel and the flight included yes
probably it were easier for you to go to washington state or maybe go to a more centrally situated place and from there fly to another place if you wanted to
from puerto rico
no i'd love to go to europe not me but my brothers one lives in wichita kansas and the other in puerto rico they travel a lot
they went around all europe and they told me all about what's is like there paris spain
i'd like one of my favorites is autralia
yes and australia would be enchanting because its pretty exotic there so is new zealand but also i'd really like to visit italy spain france all those places but i think that number one for me is australia
italy yes italy is beautiful
there's lots of history yes well i worked for a company where the president of the company is australian and the owner of the company too so we developed a good friendship and all that
and he was always inviting me to go there but i had a five yearold daughter i'm a single father
and i had joint custody
so
i would never abandon her never leave her behind
from chile how nice how much time did you spend here
yes yes when she forgets she's got a dad and and begins to think more about boyfriends yes
yes yes but until now well i'm crazy about her and she's crazy about me and
we get along so well
yes exactly well i want to go to puerto rico next year so she can meet her puerto rican half beause her mother is mexican
then i want that she knows this and she is crazy about going and to see her grandmother that her grandmother comes here every year and they get along so well they have good chemistry the two of them
her well she has traveled so many times by plane
ah traveled more than i in the last three years because she goes to mexico with her mother at least twice a year
oh she is very used to travelling she is very calm but i tell you that the first time we traveled well it wasn't it wasn't by plane but when i take a trip to wichita
i took one of those greyhound and it was a terrible experience because she was very small still and when she got on the bus
she was asleep but when she woke up completely she panicked
10 years oh and how do you like it do you miss your homeland
i think that she thought that she had one of the worst nightmares and people there well she was very uncomfortable and they told me things
and the trip was very bad but
she was like two years old there
yes i promised to her that i was never let to get her in a bus we called guagua
so the next time we went in an airplane a little airplane and we spend it very good she was very happy and without mention that in just
a trip hour compare to the thirteen hours when we get the bus
yes
was horrible
i would loved to see everything in the planet if i could
because i would like to travel as much as i can but in reality the economics and the situation make it very hard
and it doesn't change much this season changes
yes exactly
yes exactly but i have an opportunity to go to another places go to colorado because its very pretty
its beutiful you come here
you have many national forest you have majestic mountains you have atractive places in the city too you have many other things you have a little of everything but you are going here in the mountains and go to fabolous places the beauty is like you were in the paradise
i have spent 26 years living here
in december i will be 26 yes well yes little rights came i stopped for some time in new york for a short time
so i came here with my first exwife
so we were married about 10 years and then we both chose sides
but she is half puerto rican and half swiss
she was my high school sweetheart
cold to hot or hot to cold
yes well we were carrying on well and we ended well but we realized that we had different goals in the end
change a lot yes yes
the mother of the daughter well it was a very short matrimony
it barely lasted two years
yeah she's from oaxaca mexico
but we have a good relationship with the girl's parents we work very closely to her in fact today we went to her kindergarten's school
so to see what the teacher had to tell us and the teacher gave a a good report on the girl because she's a very good girl she has a good heart and
she has such a sweet voice everybody likes
she has she's very well behaved she's very respectful she's uh she loves god very much and she has you know good principles and she's very hungry for learning
in my ex wife you mean
today puerto rico is more or less the same climate all the time but there when it's rainy and when it's sunny during the year like
she lives very close to here i live in aurora colorado and she lives like three miles from here
yes i see her three times a week every week more on other activities like well today for example
we share together withher
yeah that's good
nope not at all
well it was invaded by americans in 1898
they took it from the spanish people so they stayed and then they started putting puerto rican governments
like in 1954 they gave all of the puerto ricans the citizenship
but puerto rico for example when my parents were born they weren't citizens but i've been a citizen my whole life
so then the free state arose which is a free association of the united states
july can be pretty hot and may pretty rainy
they vote for primary presidents here but not for presidential elections
so its kind of independent somehow it has
a dependece with the united states of american would be very hard puerto rico is an independent country because
they would have to approve it over there first they've never approved it and they wont
good evening mildred from connecticut
uh um
what type of music do you listen to
rock and all of that ahm
reggaeton and all of that
oh
yes i yes i listen of everything reggaeton rap of everything
rock i don't lik me i listen but i don't like it for for a long time fora little while ok but like a whole night liztening rock no
i am not much of a rocker
but yes the bachata merengue salsa everything that is music classical music
romantic music beautiful yes i find that yes the music makes the countries be known it makes the people in different countries to be known
mildred
and
yeah yeah
i believe that yes that it unites many people even though they are from different nationalities there are people that are from mexico that like salsa there are people that are
from other countries that like salsa the merengue yes yes the bachata when you go to dance well
there
there are many countries dancing
i also like mexican music because it has a good rythm especially the rancheras i love it yes
i like them a lot
yes yeah
yes really nice really nice and chinese also chinese music
where are you from arturo
yes especially you know if i could play it it would be nicer because they almost every time present a story during presentations women are always moving their hands
yes and the fans
they use then like to narrate a story
yes like the older times when natives made their
dancing and the slaves were the first to use music as a protest
how bad they were they expressed all their
their dissatisfaction
i think music will always be there centuries will come and it will be always be here
even if it is different the gay the choose it will make people closer everywhere you go you listen to reggaeton and you know who is ans sometimes
i do not know if you remember there was a japanese band named the band of light
oh ok we have spoken before have we
they started playing salsa
yes the japanese were here a long time and have not done much lately but played a big part in new york they did not have their original discs but they did play the
the discs themselves were doing them in japanese and salsa music
i'm sure if a japanese came here to america oh i was saying because you've heard this song
i do not understand what he said but
mhm and i think it's beautiful and relaxing music
one uses it to relax
and i have a disc from puerto rico with music that recorded from the sounds of the river
for relaxing for one
when one wants to go home and be relaxed you can put your candles on that color it will help you relax
i'm sorry
mhm yeah and we need music we are missing music because its the best in music people would be like
a little bit more aggressive as well
because music relaxes you
ha
um
oh
almost always they would start throwing them out
because they called it protest music really
in puerto rico they had the mole the mole and who was that guy who sang protest music juan manuel serrat sang protest music and sometimes when he gave concerts they wouldn't let them you know
because they sang the truth of the people
yes
against the government and all that they they
they tried to boycott the concerts so people wouldn't go
but it's interesting because that tells a story
yes i think the same i think that
as i as i tell you i think music is really necessary
it tells love stories it tells sad stories it tells the problems of the people
daily life is used for a lot of things
yes i think that i love music i think that when i play music i clean my house faster
no you see i always liked the piano and my kids took a piano class but i never had the chance that my mother would have had the money to pay for my classes of
i like the guitar and the harp very much
puerto rican uh um
the harp that's a a not very common instrument but find it's music beautiful
yeah the harp is very nice you know what i like too i also love accordion music
yeah right they use it in puerto rico the people from what what we call gicaro country music during holiday parties and all that they use it then
but you don't play any instrument
my boyfriend plays my boyfriend plays the bass he played too because he doesn't anymore not now that he's older
but
he played with bands and orchestras and he played the piano
mhm
and it's relaxing
and that's good
today it's about music
that is good i need it very much
because it dj
it's on so there is music throughout the house
and each is put on the internet passes recorders and
and we make discs to people if they want
sometimes we have parties and we do it is that recording a complete disc of songs and gave it to the person
aha
aha
do you like it
hi how are you what's your name
do you play an instrument or
well of everything ehm music ehm jazz a little of classical music since i also listen a lot to like i don't know ehm contemporary music such a alternative and like fusions like that like
fusion of jazz with funk
little of everything what do you listen to
no do you like reggaeton
do you like reggaeton
yes aha
no i yes i am very much a rocker
yes
yes yes but
mildred this is arturo
lately i think that that has been lost as well because like the music now it is now becoming so mainsteam like for example hip hop that now that is everybody is making that usic the same way
in the united state in mexico in all wave are imitating and are just taking like one or rather it has become a global common
everyone listens to them i think so i do not like them really but is very impressive how everyone is adopting the hip hop
inside the his/her music i think is like the regueton is also doing much also
in mexico also the mexican music is using a lot of hip hop there are more like rock bands that use hip hop or something like that
yes
yes yes
yes i like to dance merengue and also salsa
yes
yes the rancheras
um i'm from mexico but i'm now in philadelphia
yes they are very good yes me too but i don't know how sometimes is this is interesting to learn about music from other countries like
oh have you ever heard arabian or turkish music
interesting no is good also
yes yes
yes yes
oh well everyone tells a story with music i mean in everyone music without lyrics is also telling it's painting like a picture or image it's like
an stage if it has lyrics well it's always related with a feeling or a story mexican music like the  corridos
they are very well known well because they tell stories to so different from the ones you have lived but the stories are real y remarkable and good sometimes
yes
yes
may be
oh
yes yes
of course
yes ha
aha
no not if
oh japanese
no i've never heard it
clearly
yes yes me too
i think so i don't where are you from puerto rico
very relaxing to distract
ah
yes
ha like lots of environmental sounds that are
yeah its just that music is
music that is um violent helps you feel better right music is also important for the liberation of something like
there's a singer his name is'hay music afrobid' his name is cela kuti and this man well he stops the civil war in nigeria
it was important because with his music he made the movements of revolution i mean people didn't see him as a musician but as a political leader
what and following his music moved people so he kept making new discs
the military sometimes got mad he had a complete community of practice men like him that had his same political philosophy
yeah i've spoken with you
and everyone lived together in communities and then he took a disc that was called zombi which criticized the army because they were like the governments puppets
for killing people of their same race
he said all of this in his songs and the military people would hear it
yeah yeah they were throwing him out they hit him and burned him and put down his house
exactly music
yeah sure
yes yes
people got really agitated and the government doesn't like that
yes
yes that gets marked in history too music will always reflect what people are living in a certain moment and what they think
i was talking about i don't remember what but i remember that now it's about music
yes nice
yes always
yes
yes yes i think it's essential just as essential as air i think we couldn't live without
yeah and do you play any music do you play any instrument
yeah
oh the harp
yeah not so much in fact i had a friend in school who played the harp very beautiful right
yeah but yeah like you said well in mexican music they use accordion a lot
yeah yeah yeah
yeah it's very good music isn't it
yeah i play uh the guitar the bass and well i tried piano for a while but it was very hard i i couldn't
well i just stayed with
right
yes
it's always good to play music i think
also serves to vent a while when i want something as distracting or my bass and play a while and
i get distracted if i relax
yes
mhm
ah
a lot
ah okay
yes
aha
yes
a parent if my uncle does something very similar also the this is the well it was like
but now he does not work much on that now he really is with other job but but also records
good night i'm joe
good good growing getting very cute and sweet
hey you have
sorry go on
oh i remember that
yes
yes the crime could happen anywhere
that's the sad thing that someone
and not trust certain people especially strangers
i i always teach my little girl that she should not trust strangers and to be very careful
yes and one starts to teach them that no one should touch them here or there and
yes
oh yes really already ao small she tells me whe she asks me when she can have a boyfriend i tell her a lot of time is going to pass sweetie before that is possible
yes more or less it could be
what what talking about the topic this night
well denver is a city that's considered as big but uh we
i live in aurora which is at the side of denver
it's a city also and it's plenty populated but it doesn't have the tall buildings of denver
i wouldn't say that it's quieter i would say that
because it has such a mix of everything
of good people of bad people of all ethnic groups there's crime is pretty high here and one lives with what appears to be a little fear
how are you cristina
so yes before i lived in a house now i live in an apartment and and i've found various bad situations around here
including gunfire and things like that
well yes if i could leave well i would go to a more peaceful place a a small town rather than a city
because i am rather tired of the city in fact in the i drive here every day and traffic in denver is horrible
too many cars too many and and where i take my daughter to to eh where she goes to school well it takes me a lot of time sometimes i am like an hour and a half in the morning driving before going to work
yes it is a little when one arrives to work one is already stressed
and with a headache yes
yes
what it's a small town
yes
i'm from puerto rico but i live here in denver colorado
yes around there yes
yes
yes
yes
and how is crime and things like that
ah how awesome
ah it's not like that in aurora
no crimes or anything like that
wow what what a wonderful thing
well i'm heading there then to become your neighbor
oh i have a very long time like twentysix years living here
that's completely the opposite of denver
and aurora aurora
yes
no the people in colorado too uhm hm uhm here n hm we like going to the mountains a lot camping and all of that
but here there is people from everywhere and
many places that a that that those people have come from have brought many bad habits too
so well things happen that one one lives with fear
with my daughter i always live with fear because there is a lot they always talk about in the news that there is a crime in aurora
that yes the shots that yes sole that that yes ran a child over and the car driver hit and ru
things like that
yes and you
pardon
yes
and in the cars people leave cds inside vehicles
none of that because they will brake the windows so they can steal
the cds and
i don't ever leave anything in the car that would bring attention to it
ah that's good i dream of a place like that only thing is
i am a divorced father my daughter
we have i mean my exwife and i share custody
yes i'd never want to leave my daughter behind i want to stay here until she grows up
ten years where you from
and she said once'i'll get married once and i'll forget about you' i hope not but i know that happens sometimes
a lot of good happens
but nothing i like yes i live in a very peaceful situation my brother lives in kansas
and it is very peaceful out there as well
the have festivals and the people are very peaceful
yes here there are many pretty things not everything here is nothing is ugly none of this but
it is because there are so many people living here and more moving here and is the city or the cities in colorado growing the most in america
eneh this also causes you problems
yes
yes
had i spoken with you the other night
no here is the opposite here you have the
yes
yes
and the well the in many parts from here is very peaceful and there you can find all kinds of family attractions
for adults for singles everything if fact it has many things in facts where i work it's a area where there are a lot high tech companies from
so then also even an amphitheatre is abut a block away from where i work and sometimes we can hear the concerts from where we work at
of the building
yes or no we miss that here the activities the only thing that sometimes the especially in the city in which i live in there is a lot of crime there i would like
there are other places from from here also there are areas which are very peaceful and
and good neighborhood even though there is a lot of people but they take care of each other and and like you said they have their cars open and are not worried that something will get stolen nothing like that
yes i think so
in this that is like a limit of it's a mix of good and bad
you understand and the big bad guys well they're the ones that like to take advantage
and well you live in fear and quiet
but let me tell you the traffic is horrible
it's it's really horrible because sometimes the cab drivers and during winter days it's even worse because when there starts to happen all these accidents and you can't move on the highway
it's terrible
but i always dream about a quiet place like that some day i think that i mean i will be possible in in
she lives very near like one not even two miles away from here
in what was my house um and also the house of my wife they got in too once they got in through the
the because the house has three levels
yes a girl of five years old
and the basement it is not like a basement windows were up
then they broke from the back side and the basement downstairs and they robbed a lot of things there
no she has left to work i went home check it out and i recommended her to block this and that for
not letting so easy for the bad guys right
then she did it and also in her car at work where she parks her car well they have broke in her car like three time
three times they have brake their windows they have taken the cd the stereo
yeah those are the bad things about living in the city you have good things but there is also a lot of
disadvantages
i miss it
exactly
good night cristina from idaho
you have to be careful with the kids
they relax and all
and a
oh for example when that happened it was big in the news here that the man came and killed a family and took the kids
yes a because they live right here in the town and the kids no one ever imagines that someone like that would come to these parts and
and
clearly
and one has to be careful always
clearly and
yes but you understand that when someone has kids they start to have all of these worries ah its terrible
clearly when someone doesn't have kids they only have to worry about themselves but
like at twenty five years old no
and now having kids and no
and sin
yes how is colo how is it where you live in is it a big city or do you live in the city or do you live outside
ah
uh huh
ah and a little more quiet
ah
hm mm
hm mm
fine where you from
oh yes
ah and would you like to move where would you like what type of place would you like to live in
ah
it must be
wow
a headache no
what a difference man here it is very calm
super super quiet eh
it is well idaho actually the state of idaho is rather eh country i would say
i mean the biggest city is boise
ah how long
but it is a quiet city and and it is rather a small city
and this is the largest city the next following that i would say is idaho falls but i consider that is like a large town
but it's not a city city but it's since there are no large buildings or things like that or even buildings really
but then ah there are it's like for what is there it is a large town but mm
oh nothing happens people live leaving their doors open their cars unlocked
and
of course it's very tranquil i mean here the daily news ah talks about ah someone has lost something i mean news no nothing nothing happens yes
if something were to happen it would be the news
of course over months no nothing absolutely nothing
at times too quiet
oh
yes it's very tranquil and people many people live in the country so they live it's it's tranquil super super tranquil
ehm yes
like i say it is too much too much quiet there is and there is ot much to do i mean over here the people that live here they like a lot doing things outside like
camping go fishing and go to the mountains to ski and
of course since
of course
of course
sure
sure
sure
i have ten years
like a cit like a city city well
we lived in when i lived in chile i lived in santiago for a while which is the capitol
and of course living in a city is different i mean you can't leave open doors you can't trust anybody generally and
of course
everything
everywhere or
of course around here is very quiet too quiet for me but is ok cause i have kids so its good to raise them and all that
that't why
of course
you must be close to
from chile
of course
yes
i see
i don't understand
a little more relaxed
i see
i see
yes and this is why i'm strange because here there isn't much to do aside from outdoor things here there is no opera or a place for
the mall is very small there are no places to go visit or places for ballet or concerts and things like that these things are not here
well it's just another city you know how they say or the city in utah
i think the voice sounds familiar
and and if you like to do things like go to concerts or go to you know an opera or theater o whatever thing like a show
no there are not i have to drive four hours or three hours to go do something here there is not much to do what's unique is that there university that is here has these small shows and things but
that is missing from the city
that you can find this type of entertainment but at the same time is
uh with the peacefulness and all that that i liked a lot when we lived in utah
oh in city is like a city that has everything that you could want
is very peaceful
of course
yeah
of course
yes you have a daughter
you see that i like to be close to something like that that could have more activities and things like that
hm
of course
right
right
right
that i really don't miss
oh the snow the ice and all that oh
oh yeah i don't miss that at all
well yeah well when you uh when you and where does your daughter live now she lives near too right
ah yes i remember how is your daughter
oh
right
yes
oh and they weren't home or were they
of course
oh that s bad
that's really bad
of course you have to
you have to be careful
here you can relax and that's a problem because we are missing the people from outside they take advantage of these things people trust too much
hello good afternoon
and well fine nothing else with the weather i don't get accustomedmakes me feel sick
i swear that in the morning i turn around and i get i get mad oh again
oh i'm at the highrises right
yes where
no no no i lived before coming here i lived in i lived in singapore for two years and before that in mexico city my whole life
yes
yeah sure i am accustomed to the tropic
then you're tropic like that no nothing else then
yes i got here and that's how today today what's going on
yes
maira speaking
and the air raining for a week i don't understand how can you survive this time
yes
yes yes yes and what happens is that the cold yes you can bear it like that supposed until december christmas is gone and then when what happens is that
when you return you think yeah well christmas is gone well you say already already the cold is over
the cold is for christmas and already and you return and it's worse that's when it hits me and i'm left like oh no
enough enough please
yes
come on really
come on aha
oh you just can't
memo are you memo
and i was thinking of going there it's good i didn't go because i would not have survived i swear to you that i wouldn't have survived
aha
oh
today poor guy
oh
today poor guy
he asked for it
oh
what year is your brother in
ah ok
who are you
it is well
about what about crime
here in philly i have not heard much i mean i hear that there are some people who are robbed on fortyfirst and one or whatever
but i believe that i always have had good luck because i have been working at night alone on fortyfirst and i like going to the store
to the fruit store on fortyeighth and when i want i go there and nothing has ever happened
yes by myself too i comfortable in addition i mean don't believe i pay attention i'm not scared or anything
and nothing has ever happened or have i had reason to to be scared or anything on the contrary everybody is really nice when i get there
the i don't know i think that
i think that i am lucky because in mexico it is the same thing i mean all my friends in mexico have a story of being robbed or kidnapped or something has been done to them
and nothing has ever happened to me i always go alone at bad times of night in bad places like that and like that all the things they tell you you shouldn't do
ah again
i've done all this and still nothing has happened to me
yes yes i promise you it's just like that i see what i've done and i remember what i've done y how did i dare do it
what were you thinking you were an irresponsible teenager but well nothing like that's ever happened to me
so i don't know no i don't necessarily feel that it's unsafe because i don't have many reasons to feel that way but you you know philly
ah yes what's up
oh
yes
yeah they do have both
yes yes it is very safe here
ok
how are you
yes
yes in general my ah in philadelphia like there are some places that i don't dare go
i don't like it you know at night at the center city there's some places i don't like to walk by
but i don't know maybe because i don't know the city well i believe i don't know i know people from here
that is in mexico it happens that if i see someone and i know i don't get close and i cross the street or not
and here is like that like i don't know don't know and who i'm scared off and who i doesn't
well no no no
yes
uhum
yes also
very well how is everything how are the classes going
hey but little then you don't know anyone from philly that has a history of a of them being robbed of something
uhum o k
uhum
yes too
of course and they're also in a lot and is also a lot rare for it to happen to you if you're walking alone or in
the forty and three that's how it always happensa therefore if they can not do that either right
yes it's very quiet
don't worry about anything
yes and there's no light
and no light
fine
on the blocks
uh um
yes
me fineall quiet the exams are over therefore i am in that week in which nothing else nothing else can be done
hello good afternoon what
ah no
no but but where are you from or where do you live
uh before you came here
oh before i came here to study
oh so that's it
yes it's very hot oh it's hotter than here
it's very hot in singapore right
yes
oh and then here uh yes it's cold and
uh
ah maira ah how are you this is jose
no it's cold and yes there's no sun oh yes well i don't know after the summer it feels good but a a on a week like this with a little cold and
like that uh ah not much like that i like it but ah yes you know that it's just the beginning right of a terrible winter
so ouch but that that's what i don't like but
uhum
ah
yes i know it's like my my brother that studies in in in cornell that it's like much more to the north it must be like six hours from philadelphia but it's
much more to the north
and there is such a cold there that they don't even start classes until until the end of january until the twenty eighth of january or
yes yes because well he says that over there it's so cold that in order that me we better spend some more days in may than spend some days here in january right the students because it's that
they are it's that the cold in cornell is brutal the on in philadelphia at least one can bear it right the one in cornell is is too much
allo um
and my brother
it is true is is not that and my brother uhm well he was lucky to to had been given a what they call a townhouse
but that that it was much larger then one would come in and they had a first small living room downstairs and kitchen and then one would go up and over there were all all the other roos
it was rather large but the problem is that they were some of the new university dorms
and they had built it in in the in a in the outskirts of of the university then it was to a far side of the university and his classes
were of engineering that they were in the other side of the university
and and he would say that that and too he is ah is that i say no really then i would tell him but tell him has there is there is a bus system there of of
of public transport there why don't yo use it no is that i don't want to pay the fifty dollars do you understand
true so in the end he spent the whole semester walking and and in the winter there was i don't know twenty degrees and h he would walk forty minutes to get to class is that
oh is that my brother
this is jose
no no is that it is
but it is because no no that yes is that he is cheap right he did not want to pay the fifty dollars then he would say yes me is that that is ridiculous then he would say
no because the bus only passes one time every four times each hour then he doesn't want to wait fifteen minutes is that a thing like that
ah is that my brother i don't know
no but um now he is in third year
yes yes but
and and what do you think about about crime here in philadelph
eh about crime yes
uhum
and you walk all the way to fortyeighth
yes again
oh
yes yes
uhum uhum
oh really
eh
mmm yeah i don't know philly but it does know me
for me it's like eh with me it's almost like the same story right because for me nothing has ever happened here so but of course i am alive
here near to the university i live in walnut 38 between between 38 and 39
so it's not very far and here there is a lot of security so mostly i don't know anyone i don't do anything and really i think that
of course it's occurred to you right to return it you've seen in a magazine
fine and you
but in general it's really weird because en this area there is so much security and they have cameras
and lights and they have those phones and they have people around the police on bikes that are just incredible they have
and it costs more money but also it's like in general they keep it safer
and and i imagine that that that the people from the hood for example or or the criminals right i know that that over here there's so much security that they have to be careful eh
and i think that it's been enough times ah mm they can to the to the ones that do crimes then i don't know in general it's secure enough and now
in the in the quad they have those well because before it was the security no no it wasn't it wasn't so strict because you had to pass through there and you gave the card to a person
and then they passed through the through the how's that called e the system to see if you really were a student and it wasn't
that it wasn't counterfeited eh the card and then you passed right but now
but the thing is that people went out and it was easy to get in but now they those systems that e those new doors that that
that you can't do anything right then in general they worry too much to one on the university
fine studying a little bit and they called me and i said well why not why not take a break right
eh e
yes
no e
yes
uhum
yes yes
well philadelphia has many neighborhoods that aren't even because
uh uh they have they're they're and the neighborhood is plenty secure right so one has here from the university which is also in general very secure but
say say if one goes to to the to the north like in north philly and all of that and south philly and west philly and well it's not necessary but more
i mean only that gets very very dangerous so but also to for example if one is going to go out at night they're not go to north philly to go out then it's not so
and how are you how are your classes going
to important right
for well for us
yes because if if one is going to go out if one goes to philadelphia but if one goes to old city but then in old city there is so much people that go out that they have police and everything
so then
yes uh yes in general well also there aren't many students that that go to old city in general the students are they stay here at at the university
it seems to me uh yes well in general but the people complain to much that there is that there isn't security here that we're in a bad neighborhood and
but in general it's it's that that if if every week one reads the the the d p then there's there's uh once that
that there was an an assault of whatever then one goes one naturally thinks that that it's that it's occurring a lot right but
in in reality it's a one thinks well perhaps they assault or rob i don't know two hundred students but since there are twenty thousand students and then the probability that the
that that happens to one
uhum uhum
of course it exists right but it's not so so high
yes yes
yes yes yes but that also i think that is better to live like in something like highrises of college because not specially if you go back there in at at night and
it's just it's uh yes well it's nice to have
than walking a long time people who live like that in baltimore but the blocks on baltimore are huge there they have to
yeah huge um
there's no there's no light
yes there's no light yes and but in highrises it's better it's quiet you don't have to buy all the uh furniture
uh if something happens you call college and they take care of it
but and and you have to that also there are many i have heard many stories of the problems between people who who share an apartment
hello
i'm in the linguistic program
mmh mmh mmh
mmh
of course
no i mean i know people that take it i know the ldc and what they do
but no
well the ldc collects lots of data in text oral etc then you can use it for lots of things for example
oh programs that can be understand the voice they need an entertainment they don't need
a demo lets say
so then mm for example for that and for studies like that people pronounce a word how to say it i don't know for what i mean
for lots of things and then ldc makes that they collect data in different languages and then the people
can make more things more practice or for studies more theory right
mhm yes yes
hello i'm olaya in philadelphia
well i live in west philly but not too much to the west i live on the 43 in spruce
no not too west
and aha aha
mmh
mmh mmh
well to me the truth is that i like it a lot i mean i before coming am
they told me well and i read that philadelphia was dangerous and such and
careful with west philly even in in according to the guides take ca that it is dangerous to go to campus at night
and i well i take this is my second year yere
and am i the truth is that i've never seen anything or anything has ever happened to me nor do i feel unsafe in general i mean maybe it is because
are you spanish
i don't know because i look little either i don't look to the news much that scare a bit
and and i don't know nothing has ever happened to me and no and i don't feel i don't feel in danger nor do i feel it is dangerous but well i know people people who really yes no they they are really scared of west philly and
yes but well mm
that is your that is your problem is not i mean i don't know
mhm mhm
yes mhm mm yes that is
i mean tell me tell me
mhm
mhm mhm
yes
ah okay very good nice to meet you and where are you calling from
mhm mhm mhm
not let´s see it is true that things happen i do i do know a girl that was was robbed right
and but those things happen in all the cities i don´t know
and in every city there is there is crime and and i don´t know but i think here is
there is given too much relevance it happens too much right and it is shown on the tv and in the newspaper and then then at last is like a collective state of mind
psychosis right
yes
hmm hmm
hmm and west philly i don´t know it looks to me as a suburb with not so beautiful areas but it has some beautiful areas and and very nice to walk by
and i don´t know there is people who live in center city that would never think about coming here for a walk right
also good
and i don´t know it looks to me like a very nice neighborhood it is the true
mhm
yes yes yes mm
yes
mm i at a time i went for a walk until 70th street or something like that i start to move on and i went
i wanted to see what was there and
and then i had found a norman place and poor place in other words ugly house can be seen or few houses looked very old or bad not taking care of in other words see
poor places could be seen in certain places
but but i haven't seen anything unpleasant or something that could be scary i don't know is like you could see it
but but the earnings of that places was but lower than othersno
now i'm studying
and of course also i was surprised not to see a white person on the place that also
those are the things that have surprised me the most about philadelphia no the the big division there still is
yes mhm
mhm h yes really and sometimes it's curious mm i mm ah i take the bus here here in front of my house and sometimes when i get inside the bus everyone is black and the the bus starts like changing color you know the more it proceeds
that it goes that it goes to the east and when you go west the other way around that's a thing
yes yes yes it's curious
of course of course it's a relationship with the social class no more more than something racial that's clear yes
where are you from from m from mexico
they say it's dangerous no o what it
mhm
in in upenn the university
oh
mhm mhm
mhm mhm
wow
sure sure sure
i heard that too i mean kidnaps like that
yeah yeah yeah yeah
wow
mhm
mhm mhm
yes what do you do
mmh
and before people didn't they didn't report it because they were afraid
mmh
ok ok ok mmh
mmh mmh
mmh mmh
mm
mmh
mmh
wow hmmm hmm
aha
wow impressive
hmm hmm
hmm hmm and
i don't know how it is in me sorry i also don't know how it is in mexico but also i think here tv i mean
it provokes you no that there are the same fear because news are really local and very
talking about it and every mugging they talk about it and explain it and explain it again and
really
yes yes yes a lot of looking for the morbid fascination and the i don't know what
and
yeah
hello whom am i speaking to
ah okay do you have anything to do with this program
but yes yes
well yes in mexico in mexico well not so much not so much because hmm it's so excessive that that
practically impossible to be building every assault or every
each this rape or each i don't know
each assault there is you understand then it is what it is tremendously big i mean when there are kidnappings
very drastic or when they are like the the the the the case of the two the two dead women in juarez who are who are
oh okay
and i mean what is the end result of making this program what is it for
oh
oh okay ok
okay okay
ha wow
ha
more specialized
wow okay so then where do you live in philadelphia what neighborhood
olay i'm arturo
oh okay okay so its not too much to the west like you say
yes yes i live on campus
but i live all the way up on fortieth
in the high rises
and how who do you feel the environment is there living around fortythird
yes
yes
aha
mmh
yes that too
eh no i'm from mexico
yes people black people no it is like many people get intimidated by the black people here
e to me
yes sure no but what i mean like many people relate to west philly with like so the neighborhood like the ghetto no like
the neighborhood of black people and like insecure
but
i mean i i don't feel so intimidated either not at all because i have a friend that lives in the forty five
and and i walk to go there very frequently and and also at night and all
and eh and i also find many people there sometimes at night because i have to walk across the the eh the park
and eh and there are many people there is also eh at night in this way at two at the morning there are partying and so eh
i have never received a threat not i mean they never do more that asking me for a cigarette or something like that and that is
from philadelphia also in fact yes
no i mean in really don't don't see that they are promoting there like
ah ok
yes all yes yes yes
yes aha
yes yes
yes i think is like you say like they are overreacting then the people by themselves
like the idea that is very unsafe but really don´t not so much whatever is like the idealization like they were thinking about it
they are making it worst than it really is
yes yes
of course not
what do you do in philadelphia do you work or study
yes i don´t i don´t dislike it
in other words is not only singular or particular nice not even but but then in other words is like you said they have beautiful places to walk a while and
and then also i said like living in here as a college guy then this then whole world in living in here then at the same time how then no don't even want to be very far from here because is very disconnected from the people and the university then
also i believe
that is why we have this accommodation to those whom live in the university
to yeah
and what did you found
haha
yes
yes no
ah okay
they earn way less yeah
yes yes yes
yes the displacement is striking you know
you know it's striking to see that like the more to the west you go the more black people there is and less and less whites
yes yes yes
yes yes yes yes it's true i have used the bus just one time but but i remember also getting up and then then notice that
everybody was black when you went to the eas to the west
yes but well that's that's also well it's like it's a consequence of you know the fact that the majority of of the people here are black well is is of the lowest income then well
of course yes more than anything it's only that but
from the city from mexico city
oh me too
yes yes there there is much more serious the the you know the matter you know it's not like here at all that that you know you know there is seriously
and specially there still is a lot of separation you know of of social classes and it's evident you know is
i'm like i have something like a a look more like european lets say i'm white my skin is white and my eyes bright
and if i walk through some neighborhood there in mexico an unsafe one
be sure that i will not get out of there with my wallet
not even i mean but in i in in like an hour i mean no they won't take any time jumping me
and they might even kidnap me i mean its very more likely that they kidnap me
yeah its impressive right now its its its interesting because kidnaps they may kidnap anybody i mean now it doesn't even matter if you belong to a family
that's important nothing whoever they carjack someone take him and they call that express kidnapping then they they they take you and take what they can from you i mean from some
thousands of dollars to if you have more well what whatever you have i mean whatever you have i mean no more people are
yes chemical engineering undergraduate
like desperate then you see they do they do stupid things actually and its
terrible but well but well actually i mean lately there has been a lot more social awareness regarding that the the citizens well now they're starting to lets say to oppose that do you understand me so
people declare the the this assaults people now oppose
i mean there has been a lot more this much more participation becase before there was like well nobody
yes because yes no and because the truth also the the security system was practically it was useless i mean one reported a crime and
it was an ordeal of paperwork that i don't know that didn't accomplish anything
e but then finally they have been well let's say a little more this this reaffirming the action of of police and things like that and trying dial of a
catch more thieves and kidnappers and much more like that then people already feel that there is a bit more response with all that
with the reports
earlier not so much but even like that and also for example there was a march in in mexico a couple of years ago
and you
a year and half ago almost that it was called a silent march for mexico's safety in which everybody went and walked to to the
to the city's plinth
and there were millions of people it was full
i mean there were everyone was dressed in white and everyone was on the streets
then as you've seen i mean it's something like socially needed i mean people are
a lot more attention to security
anything else
yes
yes yes yes yes
yes a lot of yellow journalism let's say no
yeah its javier
and you can make one description of your own
it would be nice
and have you have any problem in court or something
yes
and you can this could also happen but i'm saying it's optional if you send a letter
eh it is optional if you want it or do you need to go no matter what i don't know exactly
aha
oh
clearly yes
oh yes it's like one case a friend of mine sent them a letter too but as he is working from 6 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon then no they said that
the manager of the company said that he was someone that could not this someone who could not miss
exactly
well yes yes yes but i don't know i think sometimes it would be good in most of the cases of
hi how are you um i think this is good i haven't ever participated but i would like too one day i don't know
violations of girls and boys
if you serve as a jury and and yes how it is yes if you realize that the person if the person is guilty and
you can help that justice can be made i think it will be a good idea to serve as a jury
ah
hay shrill
oh yes yes no i couldn't stand it it doesn't matter that it's ugly i mean horrible that
that you ah where did they sent you i mean in what state
oh you're living in canada oh
i'm here in new york
yes but ah i was telling you about my friend from arizona because i lived there in arizona and
oh really
and then then in canada eh it's the same system of eh you think
oh look mm eh nice really nice then
i don't know as if i can tell you why the day touches me well yes yes that's how it was but but like you say you have to be careful right
oh or it might be you right
to but me i imagine that they have to have a meeting or a session to tell you to explain the case to you
you are already involved you've already decided
oh sure sure sure
no too late
what what is your name right
petty or sessy or jessy
oh no um you know sometimes they say that is kind off difficult more than anything to comprehend
oh besy
javier yes yes yes
oh for how long have you been living in canada how much time
fifteen years wow
how can you stand the cold
sure
yes
sure
oh
oh
because later you have too or you have a problem of this kind so you don't have anything like that on your record or your data is more secure i dont know
oh sure and in in what state is it provinces or states
oh vancouver sure that's not in washington state
yes no oh yes yes and you know i was planning on going to vancouver because some friends from bolivia were there
but i lost touch with them and i could no longer go because they tell me that life over there is very peaceful i don't know if it's true
oh
yes yes
ah
well yes ah
oh and where are you from originally
oh yes i thought so i'm from ecuador
yeah
yes because i hear a little bit of an accent like from salvador yes well how nice and maybe one day i'll see if i can go because i tell you here
here it's like like the subject of justice no here it's also like sometimes no no things aren't good
and and he and he what
yes what
ah ok
what here in the united states
right yes i mean yea they give you the gas chamber or you know
yea
oh yea yes yes yes yes
yea
yeah yeah
right the the they're treat her badly or she'll be bad off but yea just think that ok yea a serial killer that killed someone and
and next what to the gas chamber no well they have to give them a punishment yes or not of a few years
yeah right that too
mmh
yes well no
of course it is there they are going to discount him
what he did i don't know why why ah do people do that no
ok but well as i tell you
people are crazy
and as i tell you here it is becoming every day more difficult you hear the comments that in canada everything is more quiet
um well a narc or something
yes
oh the i don't know here medicare or something like that
yeah
yeah exactly
and there
more fair then
today that's good
hey and what about job opportunities there
what kind of any ki ehm contruction
yeah
oh yeah you are completely right no cause you can say its not like that
oh
yeah yeah
oh no because
because i was hearing that is true that that this country canada needs a lot of people isn't it
oh yes there there there is a program it is on the internet and if i can accumulate points as seventyfour and i will
i can go to work and the government help me with everything
yes
yes that is
if i could do
i'm a little interested in doing that you think
alex uh besy
yeah and they have friends lets say you say hes guilty then he calls his friends and they kill your kids or your
is well
yes
me no
ha yeah
mhm
aha
no this good the letter that i sent it said that no but i sent a letter to my doctor
telling him that i could not sit for too long because i have a disorder that doesn't allow me to sit or walk for too long or even stand for long
and then i said that was good that he did not have to serve the jury
and this was last year already
and i imagine this calls for a letter
to sent her to the jury
oh hi
mhm
yeah for that yes but then i don't like it a bit
because no i'm not very shrill and right
no if something happens ah like some child molesting and that of i don't know the could put you a video or something eh
oh no it's ugly indeed yes
ah no i live in canada
yes aha and you
oh aha
ya mhm oh
almost the same i think don't know
oh i got a letter last yeat
sure great
right you have to be careful right it depends but they don't tell you about that that sort of situation until you already get there perhaps at where the judge is or a the
or to where it has to be
sure but this is when already you already said yes that you are going to do it
already to be a jury member
sure and if now i say otherwise that now i don't want to do it well too late
i already said yes
bessy bessy
no besy with  b
right great and yours javier
but um for to be a judge but i then said no
and min is easy
fifteen years already
sure
oh well that i lived in a city before where winter was super cold and i had enough snow
snow fell enough
and so my husband and i decided to move to to go to the beach
in an in another province
and then here here the winter is like just rain
and it doesn't freeze over
aha it's it's a province british columbia is near uh where i live is near vancouver i don't know if you've been to the city aha
mhm
yes yes more or less yes aha yes
oh aha
oh yes this a person with whom i spoke before told me that oh you must live in a paradise and i tell him why
because there are several islands all around and the sea is really near and you can go to the united states
well having a passport
can go alone crossing the border and
from here the border here is like ten minutes away
yes from washington
from el salvador
ah aha
i don't know i think that being a judge it something like dangerous because well it depends on the cases and the judge makes the decisions
yes yes
yea and there are
ah uh sorry
no this there are uh what's it called ah yea what what let's say you kill someone and they give you the death penalty
uh there are are there any states there that do that
the pen the death penalty yea
yea but i i was watching something in the something on the news the other day that this woman she killed her three kids
the the she put them in the water and the kids drowned
and so and my mom tells me no they should put her to death drown here and i tell her it'd be better for them to send her to jail because in jail she'd suffer more
with the other prisoners knowing what she did and because she
so you mean it likes um
or i'm saying like mm they'll do stuff to her put her in pieces i'm saying
ok of course something that makes him suffer no because if they just kill him and
suffered mm what ten minutes or whatever and was but but if they put it in jail ah the other inmates mm
poor him
there yes there people do suffer i say
mmh there they are going to there he is going to pay for what he did ok
ok
who knows crazy people
mmh
ok here it is more calm yes
a case that somebody killed someone or something or someone that sells drugs
because i imagine that healthcare of of the united states it is not it is not so good or or it is like the the this what is it called
how is it called this mmm a a card given for health care i don't know the name
yeah me medicare yes that one
no it's not so good
or or yes
ahm here is mmm i say it's good because
it's more fair yes and here is more fair than
than there
yes ah they're seaching for a lot of people to work in construction
sure huh i think it's making buildings or something like that
whats it called from the
yeah they asking in other provinces
ok but if someone has if someone has the experience constructing buildings or houses or something like this
i imagine it is possible to apply for a visa or something i do not know
aha
at least in the in the province where i am eh eh i heard yesterday on the news that was requiring people to
to to work in construction
for to where here
oh really oh i didn't know it
mm
mmm
hello hello g hello hello
uh the blacks and the hispanic things like that i wanted to know
eh we all have one
yea so it's like but it bothers me that such a simple thing like you know you are puerto rican i am dominican
no no no i know but
yea but what kills me is that we're so close in proximity
dominicans republicans santo domingo are what like ninety miles apart we are closer than florida and cuba
and we hate each other just because of where we were born what is that
exactly yea but i you know
hm mm
it just it makes me laugh i usually don tell people until i'm asked but i never deny my race like people say something and i'll stand and be like oh hold up
hm mm
hm mm
get out of here
oh thank you so much i speak spanish like a white person too
oh l / let me find out ok that's another eh that's anohter thing that bothers me just because a perso is um you what what does it mean to some white
you know what i'm saying what
hum mm
no abs please i'll tell everybody i don't care
hum mm
aha
no it's no it's no your fault it's not
your fault is not to is you know people act ignorant around me all the itme and say stupid things like that and it's like
oh yes they always criticize criticize yes if you marry
yes yes if you marry a hispanic girl
i i am uh my father is dominican
i'm both parents
yes ah well yes my husband is puerto rican
so ah that was also a problem
with his family of course his family doesn't like dominican people
so however when you look at it that has nothing to do with the race because even my husband says it if we were to get into details
hello if not okay uh what is your name and where are you from
each family's stuff if it was a family situation
my family has even more professionals in my family we are more educated uh
unfortunately we are more economically stable however
the only reason that i would not be like by them was that my last girlfriend who was older than me was puertorican
and i am of dominican parents born and raised here
aha
g
aha
aha
yeah uh i can not stand the ignorance of
okay my name is jennifer of new york
is yes a wife of my brother is um african american it you know
what
uhm eh mannhattan
oh ok so yeah so um the topic for me i understand it i have been raised here in new york um
i understand and it's not a big deal for me if the two people are happy
ah no i care a little that they are green and yellow uh pst
hm mm
ah ok and the funny thing is that not all of us are equal
because there are dominican people in my own family that do no like me
me i do not like them
okay let's start this thing so we can finish quickly
yea
hm mm
yes uh um
yeah but
but uh exactly they don't i love to tell people i talj them in my professional life i talk to all kinds of people and what i tell them is
i talk to them where are you from i'm dominican
what from where how can it be i thought you were what has that have to do with it
uh um
right
right
okay so uh the theme uh uh was interracial marriage
uh
uh um
but but that's
he's your friend but that is ignorance because
you know
yes
it's that no
exactly
that is it doesn't have that is i'm sorry that's ignorance
yeah that eh
oh yeah that was the theme today so what do you think about interracial marriage
and you still you being know that that doesn't have anything to do with that
that that doesn't change anything because still
uh huh
hmm
there are of every kind in every every race
yes now there are because this is true about dominicans they love multiplying
having children
yes
yes
eh but you know that
hm mm
eh yeah i want to speak english eh i can't we can't
but all that's because the brother is a policeman here on manhattan
on the twentythree and yeah house um and he uh and i work with uh at inves ah as an investigator but i work with mostly policeman
so on that
so give me a second i always say that always where are you from after they talk to me after a while after i've helped they tell me things from dominican people in front of me
they've said oh yeah yeah they say oh where are you from uh dominican
umno
yeah right
oh yeah right
ha ha
yeah well i
ha
yeah why
it works but its just that the difference is that people criticize a person and describes a dominican that's standing on the sidewalk
oky but yea
yes exactly aha
they're recognizable because unforunately the worse dominicans the ones that are doing the things are always painted they have tattoos
they have a shirt are
yes
oh yeah eh yeah yeah that also but we are all not like that that that is whats comical because when i was in the university that was where are you from
new york oh oh what what how what what ethnicity are you oh i'm dominican oh no
if they asked what if we thought it was easier for certain races to marry as white or chinese
i don't think so
yeah oh no that one that one is unfortunately that's a a trait we all have but but still it's the whole point of
excuse me the point of de uhm because we have that attribute
no no i don't want to say that we are all the same
because i have cousins that embarrass me because they are sluts basically
and no no but no no i understand but you know let's you go to to the heart of
eh it's like that and i also have people
you know we are professionals we do what we do and regrettably ok so my grandmother had a good back part and everyone inherited it
but
no
hello sorry
i do not think it's easier it's not better but because as a latin american not if you're living now it depends on where you live if you marry if i'm latino and i marry with a brown or something
and that's all starts like even in chatrooms in the computers checking out the chatrooms
and that's just like crazy the way that we're fighting
yea well the reason why i part asked you why you're from new york'cause
like what part of new york'cause you sound like white
yeah you sound like white
but no nothing nothing of course not now let the spanish come out
yeah like
like me when i told you i'm from the bronx i thought you were going to hang up because i had three callers i todl them i'm from the bronx and they hang up
they hang up on me
in in florida disney world
in many places perhaps many people will criticize
it was a line and we were standing a few excuse me  cause you had the line was moving but they weren't moving
and i had i said bronx new york and they oh honey come one they're from the bronx and they moved and they got off the line like
out embarrassed
i was like oh oh well
yeah
we are yes
yes but all races what race are you
ah and your mother
both parents are dominican well i'm puerto rican
yes
with his
yes
yes
john eh of new york
yes
yes i
if not i have dominican family
i have many cousins who are married to dominicans
and um so they have left
divorced and all i have no contact and yet ever time i see the girls oh we are that's my cousin they have lived with us and everything
and how i was raised with my family and i have many dominican friends
i have family that is black too my cousins have married with them uh
yes are you from new york
are you from new york
oh and you
oh i'm from bronx
yeah that's what i think so too i think
yeah
yeah me too i went out with girls of different races
they are um i don't know it doesn't matter for me my first girlfriend was a dominican
yes
yea yea as i i have some friends that are dominicans
but they say that they dominicans but they don't tell much to other people that are dominicans because they are treated badly
because some of them are fresh and that he said that i have and they don't have because their same familly said that they are fresh
as you said there are a few of them coarse all those things are
yes what is the topic he heard
they're very uh nasty
they themselves get embarrassed and i told him/her that they shouldn't be embarrassed because there's that in every race
yeah i know a guy ok
no i know a guy he's a cop i'm a cop right
and i he always he even has tattoos um of the puerto rican flag
and i always thought he was puerto rican until like two or three weeks ago that we did a barbecue to like more than three weeks ago to say goodbye to summer
he was sitting there and his wife is there talking and something came up about he swore that and the flag and i didn't know that and they said that he swore on the flag that he's not dominican and this and that and he made
his uh like when he got his citizenship
and he always said he was puerto rican and all and he changed his papers to say he is puerto rican
that he was born here but he changed everything that the parents and all all that
oh okay because i did not hear mine very well
yeah i said but and why did you do it then he said because those people don't ta don't talk to me he doesn't
he doesn't want to know anything dominican i say but i that's not that way because right now there are puerto ricans who don't want to know anything about puerto ricans but
through life they say oh i'm puerto rican
they never di they never change i don't know why you should change it
and he well no i am i am american puerto rican american and with that you don't do
ah i i being dominican hey i'm dominican because i can't change it
not like him who's been paying and paying to change everything so that it comes down to that he's puerto ri and do and and from new new york
hm mm
yeah where where where i'm working now
at the bronx here there are a lot of dominicans there are are are a lot of boricuas but there are dominicans too
to me it's not that important after all they're in love with another person
that a lot of people talks ok the dominicans are beasts they don't know how to do anything there are many many dominicans
this you say there are more dominicans than whites
yes
yeah no and then the the the puerto ricans don't say anything because the more as they say the more hispanic more latins better
the whites are the there are many domincans and that and that and that
this puerto ricans want to take oh all here
that is
i know then i'm getting up myself as well
yeah yeah
yeah
yes marry whoever you want
yeah
yeah i've i'm also talking about dominicans
but in front of them the same puerto ricans in front of them
talking is one thing there are some that talk about them then they fall until they score a point
because when i'm sometimes talking in a group i say look hes dominican hes dirty this and that but im talking in a group
two or three dominicans with two or three puertoricans
with white people like we talk
but
yeah cause when i see people in the street that i know or that i see are dominicans that have a flag
i dominican come here
i'm not i do not believe it's important they do not have to import anyone either
like that yes
yes like the
yes like the women also
yes the ones from far off because of something
yes yeah
yea yeah turn around
yea
yea
yea oh no no i didn't mean it that way i meant it with the back part
yea
i do not
yea
well yeah but you know it's like that always it's like
they are as you know like sluts like you said
puerto ricans
dominicans hell yea
like look at me my family with their own cousins and everything
i know that for a fact
yea
yeah
yeah it's not even it's because like some like the dominicans say oh dominicans think they're better than us and puerto ricans think they're better than us like that
yes hello
oh yes
or they are still calling you or not
oh therefore they only pay for twenty five nothing more no
yes do it in english no
oh

oh no i whish i was working uh i wish i was going to school
but ahm
here in connecticut i think i talked to you a week ago
yeah you think that but when you are in the school you have your friends you don't have to go out to talk to your friends you know
no you know everybody is there in the same school
but when you finish and you are home it's hard to have to pay bills it is better when you are in the school
yea you have to
no no
oh yea yea
yeah yeah yeah
sure yeah
eh yeah
yeah well that doesn't happen
yes and it hung up the call was hung up no
no no your abilities
in life when when you leave school everyone calms down you know they have their family or they get married you know
you know they have kids oh and life gets harder no
yeah that's why if you want to live the american life let's say you know the american dream
the dream of the americans you know that that want to buy their house that this and that
right
yeah
yeah
right yeah
yeah you're more more responsibilities in life
eh i don't know why it hung up
but you know but and the a poor man's life it's more easier
the life of the poor doesn't have to do with anything you know if you want to work you work if you don't want to work they take care of you
you know
yeah more or less same thing you know
for eh you ha you have to get a a good woman that well the other that can help you that that has that has umm a house or that has an apartment that helps you this and that but
but that's not my life right you know
live and learn
right
right but not e
i'm telling you the big companies you are giving them your things
what's up how are you
do you not see that the big companies they give you cars no money down they give you the things
yes
hello
lots of people that i don't know there are so much calls that they didn't processed then i think they don't know how much valid calls
every person has then i don't know what they will do because there are lots of persons that fox example my mother has reached 25 calls already
but she knows there are many calls that were not cut off then have no idea about what to do right
yes they're still calling her i don't know two weeks ago yesterday they were calling her but it seems to me they still i don't know but
i guess that's right i guess that's right but and eh if the thing is at the end the thing is that it seems to me that it is not well organized and it surprise me because
they have do that a lot of times the the the ldc why they did not before two years or a year and a half ago
but before yes was eh like was in english but also they had it in arab and and spanish and whatever but yes yes t that is old history they have done it a many times then i don't know or al least one time
and that time like many months then i don't know now why so suddenly is something new ah
no
oh i know no no no and and not only that the the the recorder that was i guess some some type of computer or something that they have there eh
hello good evening
and that that that that i tel i that´s that's my theory that what they tell you was that they write for you the text in english of what he wants that that that i have to say
that that that one have to hear right
then they went to the care this translator then they put the text there
from english to spanish and then right there of of that they copied it to a computer that that that made i don't know wat t t then that there are computers or there are programs that one
puts puts a text then the computer the computer reads it
yes yes no no then then the translator it was something like that type i imagine
then what you talked about
i imagine that's what it was that was a computer
then no no no it didn't only had a very bad accent but that also everything it sad was for example when the calls would end it would say
your time is for up
fine who am i speaking with
yes no no i do not me neither since i i i didn't even pay attention until until after several times right that i heard it that that that i did not understand anything right
and then one time over there i heard yes your time is for up or for example one time ho what was it that they had ahm the the topic was dating
then
the the translation into spanish was to put on a date then that like that how do you like to put on a date things like that that are
ay incredible but and and they obviously have to have people that speak spanish right oh i don't know so that then no
it hasn't been well very very very well organized
mhm mm yes shudong yes but the great thing is that they at least pay well you're not bothered a whole lot but well you do have to answer
but it's not not too much there and they pay well
mhm
mhm
ah david is joe or jose
mm mhm
ah a surprise
yes in philadelphia yeah yes well my mom lives in the suburbs and i live here eh in in west philly in
at the university so
i'm i'm very close hmm
no no university of pennsylvania yes no yes it's different yes everybody gets confused with that because there is well penn state
it's in in the state's center
and it's uh it's a public university
and then uhmm then the university i go to it is university of pennsylvania
yes exactly yes it's a private university and it's in the city it's completely different the other one is a lot bigger it's public it's in the country
ah fine fine where do you live
ah
i don't know well i've never been there i i don't know exactly where it is
but i know i know it's in the center well maybe maybe in the eightyone maybe one probably but but even though the eightyone i think it goes more towards
no maybe yes maybe yes because i know the eighyone goes o i don't know i'd rather not say anything
yes my eee yes all i know about the eightyone is that because we used to live in tennessee
and northwest
and then near virginia we lived in virginia then we went to tennesse but what a know was the 81 was close by then
it seem like that hayway is long i don't know but are you a student or what do yo do
mhm ah ok
i think it is easier
ah yes yes how are you
yes yes yes yes
if school is good the thing is when you finish college you have more expenses
right you buy a car and want to buy things then you have to work to pay your bills right but when you are a student you live there
there i don't know do you know the instant ramen soup
no no the soup that cost twenty five cents
yes you live eating 25 cents instan ramen soup
one spends a lot less but is a life more tranquil yes is tranquil but also i think that that when people remember when they were students they forget everything how hard it is right but
yes yes but is also a life more one has more freedom more flexibility with time for example if tonight if i want to spend
all nigh awake and then i don't know studying and i don't have classes tomorrow it doesn't matter right because if one day i don't want to go to class i don't go to class right
but in your job you can't say i didn't want to go to work today
yes i don't know why
only if no no no is not very flexible
mm
much harder
yes yes yes the problem is that i feel that you have to be happy with what you have and it seems to me that is what
many people don't do because your income increase and with that obviously the work the responsibilities that you have increase right
but at the same time
everything that one consumes it one one goes to buy a better car and one maybe does this and does that and does the other and that's it when you pay attention the money's gone right and one stays it looks to me only with responsibilities right
so i don't know i i am i don't know now ah i am happy like this as a student for now right but eventually sure one has to save money and buy a house but
i don't know th that's pretty scary like that to have so many fixed payments right because it's just that one works and works and works
and one feels that that you're not enjoying the money right but also that in part is because one says well one doesn't think in all the benefits that one gets right but also
ah yes i do not know what they are going to do with that because they have
one has a car to go to work right so one has to have that to then one has to cut the weeds i don't know i think it's too many
to much like that fixed payments it's fixed responsibilities it's i don't know
yes definitively
yes no
yes yes that's it
his wife takes care of him
yes
yes yes
yes
if not then i think that is why you should be careful
all the calls that it hung up and yes it seems too
as you spend the money because it's very easy because for example if you buy one thing you're tempted to buy another and another you'll have nothing and you'll feel like you won't enjoy the money right
one has to look seriously
what is more important to me right that is what i like to do
and if not then it's not so it's better not to spend the money on that right
that's what i think
