afternoon
uh huh
ha ha
ha ha ha yeah yeah yeah yeah
mhm
aha
oh that's good that's good
aha
aha aha aha but not back home it's not the same as here
back there there is so much misery and no jobs
and here here you can get a job wherever you want
but for the family when the family stays there like my own in puerto rico i have my mom and brothers there
carmen
my nephews i go to see them sometimes
but i'm not going to live there in puerto rico because i have my two children here
even if they are adults they keep living with me
until they get married and every one of them has their job and his they go and live with their wife's and husbands
eh no you can't i can't leave there in puerto rico peacefully
in puerto rico yes yes
ah
no i came here to stay i went to florida with my mother and my little brothers
and from florida i came here in chicago with my mother and brothers
after that my mother went to puerto rico
this is the first time we're speaking isn't it
and my small brothers too went to puerto rico then i remained here as i was married i stayed
but my mother was coming and going but my mom didn't like it here for the cold time
why not and she says that that that what's it worth if you're stuck here behind four walls and in puerto rico she could be going out and living at her house
it's not the same
in puerto rico yes yes yes
but my mother is catholic and my aunt is catholic
and and and but like am my uncle is christan he goes and read the bible to my mother and and and
and he tells her a lot about father god and asks her a questions about father god and my mother responds
but he doesn't like it because my mom am after my grandmother died my mom she got rid of her eyebrows my mom
she put am holes in her ears so she could wear earrings
okay
she shaved her legs started wearing pants wearing suits
and to my granda and to my fath my uncle didn't like it
because he says that women should not use pants
by in his religion in his religion
of my mom
he says that that ahm that women should not use pants because pants were made for men
but my uncle i is very very very ahm f how is that fanatic with religion
eh has the religion to like to heart like he
that yes that he does not tell his children to get into the religion
it is just to to my mom to his sisters to his nieces to his nephews but he does not say anything to his children
in chicago
then ahm that is why ahm i tell him to him that that that he to believe in god he doesn't have to be at church the seven days of the week
but he is at church the seven days of the week
he is saturday he says that he's going to church in the morning
until the evening and sunday all day long in the church
then he's a real church fanatic
i have a friend that she's christian and she only she says she goes to church
saturday and sunday
but my uncle is all seven days of the week
and he's always talking about god that god this that god that
and i always when i go to puerto rico i tell him
twentynine years
god we have him next to us twenty four hours a day
us us i tell him you don't have to go to church to talk to god because in your own bed you can talk to god
the only thing that that you can not be asking father god only how is it to remember father god only when you have problems but all the time
because there are some people who
ay my god that give me this ay my god that but when they are of that there is no problem
then they don't remember that father god exists

well i think well i'm catholic

and all of us there um my dad my mom and all my brothers and my brothers
and we asked god father for us for all the family
and my dad always taught us that for you to be to believe in god you don't have to be inside a church
oh but i have an uncle who is christian
fine thank god and you
but he's he's in puerto rico
but every time i go to puerto rico he wants me to change religion from catholic to theirs because he says that catholic religion
is a uhm a religion that what is it that you can that is women can wear pants wear earrings or cut their hair
that they wear makeup
then he says that's not good
that uhm that catholics are very liberal unlike christians that hmm
i mean women wear their suits or a skirt and blouse
and a long skirt not a short one and don't wear makeup or earrings
then uhm but my uncle is in the religion
and and he doesn't think that that
yes it's very cold
that the same god the god he's worshiping is the same god we're worshiping
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah yeahnatural yeah yea yeah yeah
yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah
i'm from puerto rico
yeahyeahyeah
right right
mhm
right
mhm
but also in schoo in the catholic church too i remember when my children were little
for i sent them to church
and we were waiting for him to come out the the the first the first turn that he touched the people that american
we were waiting and from behind me there was a hispanic woman
there she was talking that if the woman who was coming out that if i knew she was going to a party that if her dress was very
and you
very colorful to go to church with that her highheel shoes were too tall that she was too welldressed that she look like
she was going to a party that it didn't look like she was going to a church
and i see and i said
how can she be talking if she adores god
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
but also is not like like that you will talk about others if you are going to a church
nsupposely you do not talk about others
but she was like i saw i say wow my god if she was talking like that how can she be
if you see a woman in the street showing all her body
oh do you know today's subject
ah
yeah
yea i was born in puerto rico and i was raised in puerto rico
and i cam to the united states when i was around eighteen nineteen years old ha
then i got married and
yes i have a girl that's twenty eight and a boy thats twenty six
and i'm almost 50 years old
yes
oh yeah
oh you're almost the age of my son
hello this is milgred from connecticut
adventists or  um from the evangelists
or they are from the from the taballas they gave it uh they sell them what are they called i forgot the name
but they are or it could be they are many religions they are many many we are many races and we are many religions
but to me other religions don't bother me i can interact with any religion later always and when they don't talk with me about about getting into things that i don't want understand
sure that they are not fanatics
yes
yes religion is like politics
it depends from from what point of view you look at it well the whole world is not going to be in agreement you understand
sure but it is goo it is good that that they talk about everything because in truth if someone pays attention to me i i have aunts and cousins that belong to the evangelical religion
and the majority of the rest are catholics
how are you doing good evening
and in it on the other side of the family also there are some who are away from religion
but when we get together no one is talking about religion and no one is talking about about you know about what you ought to be and what you ought to change nothing
and the husband of my cousin is evangelic always being inside the church and she does not belong to the church and they have the most happy marriage
and her her she goes only in special occasions like the mothers who do a ceremony for the mothers when they have to
en which they celebrate because they don't celebrate christmas but they do something else there other occasions that
the evangelics
yes the evangelics so the husband of my cousin i tell you he was and wasn't evangelic they got married for that religion and then after they got married he got inside the church and she didn't
and she drinks and dances and she skips and he follows her to the work parties and all and there he is present and
i mean he ain't saying to the people ah you have to stop smoking you have to stop smoking you guys have no time
yes they joke in the parties very good jokes it doesn't get badtempered or nothing you know of this nothing you don't say the most happy
hm
yes i mean it's a person who depends on everyone who who how he takes the person but they get fanatics never mind
that is
right
right well that is how he is right he is like my cousin
o really
ah ha
ah ha
in other words you don't go to church or anything
no
i go to church but i don't have what we call a  blessed nature so that i am always there at church
do you believe that joins or disjoins
you don't like it
ah ha
ah ha
oh yes yes i believe that is a very important foundation especially for children
but if we raise them with the least with with something forget it that they will leave and and they are what do i know they get they get wild
they do not have feelings or is they do not create a feeling relationship for nothing
i understand like they don'care about anything
and and and you are you say you are cristian and that and that a miracle that eh they accepted you in his family seeing how jews always
they are like you say they are
only between them that they try and get married and that they have the same religion
or do you believe that the world would be the same or better if we all believed in the same religion
yeah ah
but you married by jews or you married by catholic
oh beautiful ah yes yeah
hm mm
and what they say yeah
the my little girl the big is is were baptized and they are catholics but the youngest even though she was baptaised catholic she visits also the church
the evangelical church
she goes wih her husband cousin and you know when she goes she puts her long skirt yeah yes like she respects her
their religion to them and eh she likes to go with them and i never said no when they ask if they could take her and me yeah yes
you know
the world would be much better
ah because eh eh i believe the bible states the pants the man carries something like that eh
is related to that
hm those are the ones that became fanatics that
they interpret word for word what what is is writtenunderstand
it's like the the those those irakis with their doctrine that of craziness they kill people in the name of of
of that god they have or of or what they believe
i mean that sometimes there are people like their mind it it gets distorted
interpreting what in reality must be something that unifies because the religion must unify it doesn't matter which one it is it doesn't matter which one it is understand i don't think that because a person of one religion and another of another well
they have to to kill each other because of that because of that because of that belief
so for me since i am not fanatic about anything i i never become fanatic about anything i observe i was raised in the catholic religion
see there see there
and i helped in church and i belong to the daughters of mary club and i helped a lot in the church and all those are
always have been my my faith the catholicism but not only eh the it like i took my children to the church and i baptized them because it i was raised that way
but as adults well if they want to go wherever they feel like i will understand it is not that they that i have to say no you can not visit that other church
or you can not believe in that because catholicism says that that it is different you know
and the majority of this of this some people who are in the gospel or in jehova's witnesses and they even try to stick things through the eyes and want to come to your house to to early in the morning to go and sell whatever there is
and i well sometimes they knock and i tell them well look thanks i already have the little book and if i don't tell them well i am catholic and no
are imprudent
aha ah
there was a lady that came look every time i went through the door the woman came with with look that help us with this buy our book you know that
that you're sinning and i don't know but is that i've been a sinner since i was born my child so well the lord there can reprehend me when i get up there
yea i think it is the same and of course we are not all same races so the each race has its
uh yeah they try to i don't know they try to tell you very negative things instead of telling you well look you can know more about the lord and i don't know than other
by other means but that  you're a sinner yeah yes i keep sinning and you're sinning right now talking like that
your way of thinking say that although we are hispanic sometimes we admire other that are in it sometime we don't and sometimes we or some other catholic family and the family are
hello
sure
exactly that they don't go there
that they impose that you don't feel pressured right
concerning what they talk about but it could be that if i believe a thing that is how do you call it that religion if it separates for the same reason that there are differences
well in that which one believes the the differences always exist
exactly
for this reason they say not to discuss religion no for this for this i am not able to believe that we have a place to discuss religion in this program
sure
sure
sure
mercedes speaking from philadelphia
who are they
okay
hm
in my house what happened was
what eh my mom is evangelic
and my father did not um really go to church he never defined himself
and but all of us went to catholic church
yes then why do we not well we are always christians so
we had or rather what we learned in the school was not reinforced in the home
and how if i believe that of my brothers only the majority are still catholic my younger sister i think she's evangelical and i no i have decided that i don't have a religion
mm good evening as well
no
uh huh no
mmm hmmm i don't since i yes almost since i left went to college left college and then i decided that i would not return to
to church no no for me no truthfully this is very interesting and for me organized religion no no
no not exactly it's not that i don't like it but i don't don't feel the need in other words well i feel that god is with me in my heart
and that is how i live my life but after that i was married and my wife is jewish my son is jewish also we are going to raise him jewish
because i still believe that one needs to to be brought up in a religion
yes yes definitively i
hm mm
hm mm yes
sometimes we talk about the religion anyway
yes yes that is why i agree that yes yes he that the yes nethe children they need wellthat's why they say
yes yes for real yes
we were lucky
yes yes is for real yes there is there is say them of course there are those that are very strict right
but no my husbands family they have always been understanding including the other son that got married the girl also is not eh
jewish and i believe that i imagine that maybe because i was the second no longer
no we had a relogion a jewish ceremony
yes and lets say that is what i say my son will be raised and i say it is important for him to be raised with religion
when he becomes an adult he can decide what he wants to do
right if i want to follow or if i want don't know leave something else to do whatever but i do believe that religion whichever it may be a child should be brought up with defined religion
hm
hm mm
that i do not understand because my mom lets saymy mon eh seewhen she goes to church she needs to dress with a skirt
then i asked her what is bad about going in pants
yes but but for me that is that for me that was one of the em
reasons right of of eh not to leave not way a little of what is organised religion that are person that what the bible say too strict they take
eh yes
hm mm
hm mm
hm mm
yes
mm i think that i i think that it is what it is
hm mm
ay but it is that there are people how great i understand that they
their job is to conve not their job but they wish that people convert to their religion right but they don't respect a no
true o o that maybe one well there are peo
although we see the same religion but it's impossible for all to have the same religion because there are always going to be cultural differences
and there is always going to be each person interpreting their unique religion in their own way what's your opinion
hm mm
good evening how are you norma here in atlanta georgia where are you from
my husband is american yes uh huh
and so what do you think about religion about religions
yeah
hm
hmm
hmm
hm
well i'm really very religious i belong to a religion that is the hare krisha religion i don't know if you've ever heard of it
hmm yes it's based in a hindu philosophy
so one of us believes that an individual is a part or portion of god and we also believe in reincarnation we have rules and regulations we're vegetarians we don't eat meat eggs or fish
ah okay
mm we don't drink alcoholic beverages
because we that is we believe that that or that is each living entity deserves respect and no to avoid the violence against the enti other living entities
now then therefore we do not eat meat we do not get intoxicated with drugs or alcohol
we don't drink coffee or tea
and we don't do lasertag games
no and are you religious do you belong to some religion
mhm
mhm
ah but you do believe in god
ah that is very good or say lots of times one can not identify with one group of people or a group no
ah i'm peruvian
but the important this is for one to have god right in their heart and that one tries to develop their relationship with god that is very important
mhm a higher being
clearly
mhm yes
mhm
clearly a higher being that controls everything that happens
clearly and realistically religion or so religion or the beliefs that one holds on a higher power especially the people that in the moment of a disaster and in the moment where there is suffering then we always
right they always turn to and ask god to please help them the whole world there are many people including those that call themselves atheist in the moment in which they are the most desperate always
they don't ask they turn their face like that to ask god to help them
no that is really one is that is in their heart no one feels that a supreme being really exists that many times no
ah okay yea there's lots of peruvians around here
mm of course mmm
yes yes that's why no in philosophy we have there is always a there is a a verse that says no that when you are suffering
you always you always as help from god and that one should really should should ask god to send suffering because that way you remember him more
because otherwise when you are well you forget your relationship with god
in e in that it is true no because when you are doing well you are very happy
no then you think that you are in control no that one is the one who does that you are in control of all things that happen and that you like that you do acts no
no but really it is what it is what god blesses you and helps in many circumstances
and and you have a do you have an idea about reincarnation or something like karma law i have heard something have you read
mmm
mmm yes ajá yes one the law of karma is a law of action and reaction that activities positive or negative doesn't have also a reaction positive or negative
ah are you mexican
no for that you a lot a time says but why so many things that happen to the people although are seen persons very good but really are
reactions of past lives that you are realized actions very negatives and now is a reaction negative that is suffering
really aren't persons that are very inocents or persons that are very good that only the reaction is when you have free will
not to do anything god doesn't force to believe in him to serve or to realize his devotional service for that
you doesn't use the free will and do negative activities that a lot a times is that reaction to the law of karma for that the law of karma nobody frees of the law of karma is infallible
mhm that is what we think what we believe no
in our relidion yes
yes now i'm married and live here in an aparment around the temple where we have
the temple here in georgia en atlanta but before i live in the temple i was hospitalized there i live doing service to god
no there are different types of service that you can do you can preach you can sing lord's holy names you can cook for the lord you can offer the food to god
ah okay
and you do different activities no
not everything i mean you realize the center of your life is god no i offer him everything i do every work every cook everything i do from the moment you get up of your bed you go to the shrine
and we offer are foo to our lord so well now i'm married and with children so i have to worried about them
now but if i always am going to the temple no and there always the devoted people join together most of the sundays for grand celebrations that we have in the year
mmm
well we have bhaktivedanta prabhupada ace bhaktivedanta prabhupada he is devote to god he brought this knowledge here to the occident
no he is like us really no we honor him and
well we respect very much to jesus christ too its not that we didn't respect the other religions other believes
sure but he brought the knowledge here to the occident about the krishna conscience like us we call it the name of the city
mmmm
mhm
mmm
it's called international society for the consciousness of krishna
ah his name is ace bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada
aha yes he he was born in india
well he's no longer in the planet he died when he abandoned his body
no i mean he's a devotee he's considered a pure devotee of god then he's back there in the spiritual world
no no he hasn't reincarnated because life's goal in this world in this material world is for us to develop our devotion for god
and for us to return to the spiritual world and don't don't come back again to this material world to the cycle of birth disease and death that all living entities go through
no even animals and human beings
no
no i'm i take care of my kids i'm a stay at home mom
hmm yeah
if he's above that level he's a pure devotee
no it's it's really interesting it would be good if you are not interested you can
peruvian no no my husband is
hello
ah ok peruvian american
ah okay very good
well i think that this is from medieval times and this
religion was lost during institutionalization i mean to say that religion stopped being something spiritual
and became something more political and now recently in recent times it's stopped being so political but it has also brought a lot of those who
like the institutions therefore you can be very religious and spiritual
but not necessarily institutionalist so sometimes you don't necessarily have to be in favor of what the church says or in favor of what it says
one certain institution like judaism catholicism or muslims but sometimes you can also like i said mix a little of or all philosophies so that
better to use them to find a good way of life better than nothing
what do you think
i'm arturo i'm in i'm in pennsylvania philadelphia
ah yes yes yes i have never heard i don't really know what they're like or what hare krisha is about
yeah
and why not because you don't eat meat because you believe what
ah okay
uh huh
yes
nor do we play lasertag
and no i don't belong to any institution at the moment because i was born and i grew up catholic but right now i'm bigger right now i'm twentyone years old
like since i was eighteen years old already i didn't follow the institution because then i didn't i didn't i didn't i wasn't much interested in what was preached and
and i felt better than this before my spirituality my contact with
nice to talk with you where are you from norma
with this with god then no i didn't need to be across this institution then well no more this i dedicated myself to to reading about other religions a little but more than anything no more to
to cultivate myself and to let's say practice a good way of life but
because if i'm not any i don't like the institutions
yes definitely but no
exactly
yes yes precisely recognize that it is true that
a divinity above all things no
but yes or well based off that i have changed a lot and in fact i also study chemical engineering and many times the people believe the sciences
say tear apart the peoples religion corrupts
but i think the complete opposite because the people the begin to recognize the most scientific things and things normally are also very religious because
peruvian ah my my my roommate is pervuian
because they began to realize that the more the get to know the more they can explain
more questions arise and and more discover that the world is unexplainable and that there are such things as miracles all the time and that they are everywhere
i feel that every time the more the people know how the scientist and those people understand more that there has to be something divine a a divinity behind it all
yes
yes yes yes yes that
yes exactly not only you have to turn to religion to ask for help but also to thank
i believe that also many times people well they become religious in certain moments because they need help but when they are already well they forget that
yes
yes
yes you don't remember
from lima mexicans too
yes yes yes
yes yes yes of course
well i have heard of karma no and like that like karma i know i know i now it carries no i mean if i had bad karma you are going to reincarnate into another being but to
for better no for cleaning no for have another chance of of do your karma more good more pure is not something like that
ah okay
yes
yes
yes
ah i see the haré krishna
and what do you do you metts whit the haré kishna every week or daily
yes i'm mexican
ajá
ah si
ok
sure
ah ok and do you have a prophet or someaone like jesuschrist
ok
how is he calling
yes sure
oh ok
how do you call that mister
from mexico city
how do you call it
ah ok ok but what's the name of the gentleman that brought it
wow he's hindi of origin or where does he come from
ah okay
ah okay but then it's possible that he's been reincarnated as someone else or he won't reincarnate because he has karma
ah okay so he won't reincarnate anymore
yeah
yes exactly
okay sure
and then since he's above that level and won't reincarnate again
that's great and what do you do in georgia do you work or study
okay
ah very interesting
and how long have you been in this religion
ah okay that's great and you your husband is is he from also from

hello oh sorry its been about four minutes
its just that they don't open it when i want them to open it
yes ha
its been three times for me so then i
and he responded and told me that it was various people with that
with that problem then i got another email from her saying that they had advised the participants that didn't know spanish too well
ha and to hang up when
ahh
oh no
i not ca to me an alone lady of new york who do not speak very much spanish but i talked with her twice i laugh a lot because
her name is erdestina did you talk with her
ernestina and as i am josefina we laugh
and i tell her there is ernestina josefina and then
we laugh a little bit and she tell me and that about her family
i don't know because i think the other day i spoke with someone who lives in her home and told me she was from an island oh it's not
it's not granada but it was an an island of
there caribbean which have a special language and no it's something like that
yes but maybe she understands well yes one
rightly explained she understands look and about the email did you buy with didn't you request
jaaaaa
no
ah
aha that you won this what you get i get them through msn i have msn
then that josefina was awarded with this that she go press here and you have a free scholarship and you got i don't know
and a trip uh and cruises and
and i delete them because those are to find out
if you answer not to
mhm
ah
i say how do they find out so much about people no
two days two three days yeah
so strange people
wow
mhm mhm
to cost the expenses no
but it is
but that is horri horrible because this one i have somewhat controlled with the filter they download i don´t know they gave me a spam filter
i ordered i did not buy it but they put from msn no
they filter a little but not always the junk where it says junk it is theere are ten or twelve a day no
aha
so
oh my god
mhm
aha
ah
or it has to have an annex or attachment or something that asks
you if you want to open that email or you said
aha mine has it i mean i've been through that when i send mails via yahoo because i have an account a division
in yahoo that does that when i'm going to send an email it asks me to identified something like a code you have to do it or
says this is to protect
messages something like that
so i places the pieces the the letters however i see them
not mostly
but sometimes di is a pe r jay
you and a number and something like that
you have seen that it is like a crossword like a puzzle no
i don't know if that is what
to protect
ah yes
ohhh
it doesn't filter
ah and how is it in the in the forums you have thought about those forums those from from univision or telemundo
and when you write a word like stupid or idiot this does not does not capture it no i mean it says we don't allow this type of vocabulary in this
sure and one week you told me that you had a test maybe on friday or something like that
mm a little bit of each one
hi good evening oh this is josé
a math class that i am in and i also have um eh i am in a marketing class of marketing and i also have other some other task then
oh in one week you have a busy week but at least i have
all these two days yes free yes
ahm i still don't i i es that many nights i am busy and i can't then
only me maybe i only have twelve thirteen yes
ahh yes that is why i want to hurry up because i know that now soon
there is already people that are going to stop doing that
ahh
m
ahh
oh very well and you oh goog here relax there is no classes tomorrow then tomorrow and on tuesday
ahh yes to almost everybody
know someone in the the university or they study in the univiersity because
its just that i don't how somebody will find out about this
ok of course why not
yes yes yes it doesn't matter
um no but but it seems like the program has had various problems with computers before or with the real devices they call
that record because it happened to me several different times in the middle of the conversation then the line cut off
mhm mhm shudong yeah
yes
yes of course
yes then i came back to the house yes the fall break
yes shudong
yes shudong is what they say hang up but it does make me sad
ahh
mhm mhm
ah
yes
but is she american or
mmm
ah and it's not necessarily spanish
yes yes yes
on holidays then yes since then i'm resting
no necer never me what i have is in my account of because i have two accounts one by hotmail and one in
in the university and they almost never send me in the university one anymore
like unsolicited mail but in hotmail all are terrible every day i receive
twenty twenty five messages and all of them junk but
mhm
ah
eh yes
yes
yes the sa yes the sad part is that with but for because what people that send all these mails that they have they put ah make programs
that go through the internet of the site from a website to another website and then when they find
yes then yes also i don't have classes on friday
an email address
they put it on a list and then if
yes yes then and also go to the news group and also go to
yes all all all and then it is very easy that for example the boards for example the board of hotmail i imagine there also
they look for names and they look and then they created an enourmous list
and with that list they create the message right and then they send to everybody in the list but then the quantity that work that requieres is so little it is very litte right
and yes two or three people answer from thousands of people that they already earned enough money for for whatever
yes yes that is sad that it is that
with two or three stupids they bother all of us right
mhm
then so so i have some class on friday but no
mm
yes alwyas happens like that i read an article that i think it is very interesting that microsoft is now creating a software that does
am every time one sends a message the computer has to do a i don´t know has to break a code or do similar task that is not
very very big
so it does take some work right if you are just sending an email writing an email and then sent it you can't even tell right
so when so when the computer does that stuff so it breaks a code it does exactly that and microsoft then gives you a certificate for the email that the email
that the person wasted a little time doing that right so if you are just sending two emails it doesn't matter the email gets through and you know it's not spam but if you are sending millions of emails
you have to your computer can't process them they can't work that much right
to send so many emails it gets delayed and possibly it is expected to get delayed it's too much
too slowly and they can't send all those emails that they send nowadays
not is more more it's nothing in general i don't go because besides there is some graduated student that helps but really to the class
and when you get an email without that certificate you know it's spam and you can delete it
yes yes i don't know for sure
i don't know for sure but i i thinks that the idea
mhm
mm
yes
yes yes
aha
hmm
and the numbers yes
oh it is during the week when there is a teacher but this is when you need help really
yes i have seen them yes mmh mmh
yes i don't know i don't know
but it seems to me that the filters are not are not very like effective actually because yes one things that that that no that every time that you put because one can say ah well if you have a
a a how do you say it suspect phrases can be sent to spalm actually but many times then
the ones who create spam you know which ones are the the the suspect phrases then or phrases that that in general activate the truth filter
then they create the message in a way that it doesn't
that it doesn't catch the filter yes yes then
ahh yes every once in a while
ay how interesting
then yes yes i have a test on friday then i was studying and i also have i have many things this week on friday i also have a task to
hello how are you
what do i think of unsolicited mail well that is a nuisance
they thre it immediately to the garbage
when it arrives
it gets on my nerves
yes yes
mhm good and of and that the email is already a scandal about spam
what do you use yahoo
oh gmail yes yes
mhm
mhm
very good i'm miguel angel and i'm in philadelphia and you
yes yes i have if it is true i have yahoo and also and also what is the spam puts it in another distinctive folder and
and if you don't want to read you don't right you don't read if you don't want to
uh yes right no that's true
oh no on
yes yes yes
uh yeah no about the spanish i look i've been living in spain right until last year i haven't been here more than a year you know in the united states
and well in spain it's the same i mean there's a lot of spam there i don't know right the language doesn't matter there so that's international now
bad things get everywhere right away uh
uh i have bought i have bought stuff over the internet i mean i've bought books in amazon and i've brought tickets for concerts and all that but it has always been on my own initiative you know
uh yeah well i want to buy a book or i want to buy some cd or i want to buy a ticket for a concert or for the movies whatever
you're in new york mm are you from argentina don't tell me
but just like that because i wanted to you know never because they sent me a spam email and i opened it and bought because i just don't read it you know i delete it
so no and when i get something on the mail that i didn't ask for well the same i just throw it right away you know i don't even look at it
and sometimes man sometimes it's true i read it right but no generally i'm never interested in it and have you bought anything
uh um
hmm
yeah yeah
at least the majority of these things are they sell you things that then then they don't send you then they take your money
they send you something of very low quality or that they sell you these things they aren't they're totally because they sell them we sell them and then the best sometimes
i know people who bought it and then afterward said it was shit this is a thing that breaks after two days or
or spoils or you know that after aren't things of quality just because you say they are
oh i'm sorry since you had the  cho you know since you said new  chor well i thought i said this one is from argentina
if you say they are fine that it's the same this whatever no but everything is spam it's all a scam
it's like it's like the sale of things in all these catalogs that have
really absurd things then something to scratch your back and this is have you seen these catalogs filled with shitty things with shit
i've seen them they are really stupid things
yes for example a
and have you seen the latest thing it's like little boots that you can plug in to warm your feet have you seen them
yes and things like that no that they sell you like that the lady comes out like that the man with his feet inside that little boot that
it warms up and warms your feet i sometimes think who buys that
of course
mm
oh good good
yes
yes
oh no no the ones that call you on the phone yes i tell those straight up no
i am sorry i am sorry i am not interested and that's it and i hang up
yes
i know man that you don't know what's going on i feel a little pity the people whom work in those is not that don't laugh but it's true
i feel i feel pity about the people whom whom have to work and earn a living calling then you know they call you mister and i'm not interested and of course i say i'm not interested and i hang up
but i try to be a little polite because you know the people is working and earning a salary by calling as operators calling they're not very pleased
with people treating them bad and harrasing them and getting hanged up like that without an answer because i wor i worked then everybody
i don't know when i was younger and i was a student and so then then i had well i'm still a student but when i was younger
what is what's your name
but man well in summer you know you have well a wor i worked as operator and no it's wasn't selling no i didn't sell i
i got calls incoming in other words no i didn't made calls
and i worked for a supplier in spain and i worked for an insurance company
and what was a how is it called here like here roadside assistance
and i called people whom has gotten whose car had broken down and we did send them a wrecker to take them the car to a garage and so
and i of course i mean i used to work eight hours a day and there is a moment in which you burn out i mean you get tired that everybody calls with problems
and well and insulting you and telling you that when is that assistance is coming and so and you know treating you bad and it's not your fault at all because i was a complete nobody
i was a worker in the company and i had no idea you know if the company is good or bad or what i only got paid to to
answer the phone and give a service the best i knew then to me you know that why i feel a little pity about the people who calls
those people calling have no intentions of harassing they don't want to bother people they have to eat too just like you and me you know
atri
and they want to have a job so
i don't know i do feel somewhat sorry or understand this that yes they should not feel that because i feel sorry for them i am going to buy the product they are selling that would be too much
you know but at least treat them good tell them look i am not interested and that's it but as it is said people in the united states have lots of attitude
that's one thing i notice i perceive a cultural difference you know and as for spain it is what you'll call  intrusive
yes that to me i don't know or you know sometimes you have to be intrusive because people bug you to death sometimes but
when there is no need to be  intrusive don't be you know
i understand
sure sure
yes yes
hey odri tell me what's a peruvian woman with an argentinian accent doing in new york
ah oh oh odri like odri
yeah
yeah
hmm
ah right
ah that's why
hmm
ah right
that's good that's good very good
aodri hi and how are you
yes
no yes i ohm
to me that when i open my email and i see a lot when i see that puts me oh and i say oh this because sometimes it says to me like
five nine messages and i have who has written to me and i see there are five new four
they are direct for the trash
no but the good thing is for example the service i use for mail
what is it called no i use gmail then
yes they can and you can designate
that like them since i do not know how they do it but they have a way of verifying that like it is span and puts it in another folder
then ah i these work i am not going to say that ninety percent works very well
my name is aodri and i'm in new york
yes
yes uh i think so
i believe that most mail tech support have that now because its its like an invasion because they try every way to pu
words like it was a conversation and it's not just in english because i'm telling you
i also get plenty in spanish uh
my personal mail and my work mail and i get plenty plenty plenty
so you've never bought anything from a spam
no not me not me but i remember that it might be almost a year ago that i read an article on the paper about a man that
and yes he loves to buy things crap
he lives for this but i it seems to me i've never known anyone who
no i'm peruvian
who bought spam because for everyone he got them angry when they see the blessed spam that this that the other and i
yes
yeah it's really in bad taste
yes yes no yes you know something
perhaps if you have a reason to have them but it's a thing that why spend the money
yes yes
no but you know what i always say i say someone has to be buying that for them to send them how they send them
and they enacted some laws like in the state of virginia is illegal
send a spam an unsolicited email
but even then i still get a lot i get a bunch
you're not the first person don't worry
is also like for example the ones that call on the phone oh oh those they they really drive me crazy when i see
yes
no no no no i'm not as sweet with them no no no i tell them what are you doing with my name delete my name immediately
so there is something i don't know if it's federal but i know is from the state our governor did it and that is of a cover
and that you can you can put your name and if someone calls you they have to pay a fine because it says they weren't supposed to call you
yes i i have my boss my exboss what he would do when they would call him from one of those cards for a raffle i don't know what
eh from the mortgage he would say wait a minute and he would leave them there waiting because he said look when i need to speak with customer service of anything credit card bank i don't know what
they always put me on hold for a really long time so i love to tell them
hold and leave them there and that his things he loved to do that
ah
but tell me
yes
yes
ah okay okay
yes
yes
yes
you are right is always that way but no i am not lying by saying no i am always there i don't want to say no and i don't want oh
because it is always the same thing especially when they call me on my cell phone i say ah
in the middle of the day or sometimes at work i don't know and i have a lot of stuff to do
i'm not here for you to be bothering me
odri
well you know it's a long story well first well i was born here my parents are peruvian but then my parents left
they left their countries when they were really young
neither of my parents has a peruvian accent even my granny doesn't have one my grandfather didn't have one either
uhmm my grandfather lived in argentina for a decade and
he was very attached to the argentinian culture and all that
yes then my mom has a little bit of an accent
and well i have it i have a stronger accent but i even work for an argentinian studio
then their accent rubs off on m yes yes but no but between you and me it's a legal studio but
aodri
yes yes exactly exactly
well what do you think about the mail unsolicited
hello good day
music on that was her throwing a pl a plate at the floor because we are trying to
pardon
eh but you know we spent the whole day listening to music
classical or or you know of of to play or whatever it is and we listened to it in english and in spanish
so here when your father is in the house we talk english only
but when he goes to work we speak only in spanish
so but eh and you
aha
aha
hm mm hm mm
my name is anni and i'm calling from miami
hm mm hm mm
hm mm
yes
okay
hm mm
yes
hm mm hm mm we
well we had a
not a awkward time but my daughter all like two months ago she started to sleep at night entirely
but when she was seven eight years old we took her from our bed
hello
to her cradle and i could not you know i had a lot of difficulty to putting her to sleep and at the end i found that if i eh put her music with a sound machine
you know that she sleeps well and now uh we bought her an ipod
because uh what i do is i have you know a month and like a hundred something cd's
so i i can choose what i want her to hear normally when we put her to sleep
we pick the you know the the lullaby songs i think they're called
so uh i i turn the music on i turn on her machine of of the sound machine
well we read her a few books and that's it she knows that when she hears that you know she she goes to sleep she sleeps better i uh i put her to sleep in her crib now and in like fifteen minutes she's already
sleeping yeah and that's why that's the reason why one of the reasons why we bought the the ipod
because also when we're in the car she wants her songs and what ever and for one to carry you know carry five hundred and something cd's have them in your car
and but she's also a well she's not sometimes she uh does baby modelling
okay
so we bought her ipod with the money she
she herself does you know
that she herself eh she worked
yes yes
we did it well part of her and part mine because i have my music there too so you know
yes so
well probably ninetyfive percent is hers
and that you know because like that if we are in a place whatever it is because the the little cart is hers also
it has like eh headphone
but with that and and when we bought it i thought who is going to put a you know a walkman or something and now i am doing it
hm mm i'm i'm coming out
yes me too
hm mm
yes yes i understood you don't worry yea
yes
no but look we're going to have the uh our next baby
god willing within a week
and you know that's what we're doing we're going to go to the to a maternity center that's here and that's what we're going to do
because you know for me the first one was a cesarian and
no and it wasn't because i wanted it it was supposedly for an emergency
but i think that ok
yes no no it doesn't matter
that's ok then
you know ther therefore we are going to do that and with her she doesn't watch any television
you know eh a lot of times when we take her to church and they show her you know the dolls of elmo
or whatever she just looks like what's that and the people looks at me like she doesn't know who is elmo and i because we don't watch television
aha
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
music
well and also you know i since we are going to have a baby i was thinking that we are going to have her
not watch tv but i was searching to see what educational program i could let her watch but
yes but i i still couldn't
yes but
what happens to me is that i know that the tv i'm not going to have any problem eh to get her interested
and that i prefer if i can to wait til she's at least three or four years old
that she continues with the love of books and music and all that i rather prefer you know that we continue with that i don't know
yes when the ba the baby arrives that that i am going to feel that that in order for me to have a little time you know
what i'm going to do the most if i do it is going to be half an hour a day and it is going to be a program that i know that
you know it is educational
ah music eh we pass the entire day listening to music i have a daughter of twentythree months
but al
well the the biggest difficulty we have is that no we don't watch much television
but and if you go into our our home of ours you would think that we watch much television with because our house eh brings a
came with one of that fiftytwoinch televisions
then also last christmas we bought a tivo
then we rec record you know those old movies or the shows we want to see but
but it's nothing we never watch abc nbc none of that
it's always the discovery channel or you know things like that like the history channel
but because of that because i don't want her to watch tv my husband he's watching less tv
because when he's home and she's awake we don't you know we don't turn it on
and no i did not say that she watches television but i always have
so that that was one of the difficulties we had because he he you know he understands that i don't want her watching televi
sion but he doesn't understand that if he's watching then she's watching
yeah
hello
uh hmm
oh yes
oh okay okay
it's like like allowing her to
yeah that's that's the problem i have with mine i mean because i also don't watch tv i'm in the room all the time
oh okay
no that is good don't worry
hm mm
ah okay
hm mm
oh yes okay i understand
ah good me uh normal i i oh listen to all kinds of music
i don't have a favorite i can go for all even music in another language
um and yes i pass the whole day listening to different music because as they say music calms
good day ah my name is jenny and i'm calling from new york
until the most ferocious animal eh i think it is so so in these moments i work at at home
and i also work in the court so when i'm not discussing something in the court i'm at home and in that moments when you feel more agitated
oh the best time to turn on the radio and listen something to relax you and put you back in the
in the way you should be thinking um not yet i don't have children but um i was some years working in a pre care
and that was the best when you wanted that
a class of of eighteen kids of four years get calm down
play a a or some music eh classical
and it is like changes the all the mood in the room because yes this affects the sense of of of the animal human you can say
so hm mm
oh okay
ah okay hello
hm mm
um um
ok
um
uh um
yeah
uh um
wow so she has her routine
uh um
oh yes it's better to bring the ipod than
um can you wait a moment the other telephone line is ringing i'll be right back
uh um
oh
aha
so it it is kind of like her vagrancy they did it
ah well that is a good idea
well or like no it is not going to be just her music anymore
oh oh that's how things are
oh wow
hm mm
yes
okay
no that is the best that is the best because i tell you the point of view of a person who was an educator
the music that is that the kids that the parents they they let them they cultivate a love of music in them it's like um teaching them to read
because it helps them with their concentration with uh their movements if if if you've ever watched kids you when they hear piano music
they move their little fingers as if they were playing a piano all of that helps
for the uh development i forgot i forgot how to say development in spanish
well the development there we go the development of the kid for e for yesterday so it's quite a marvel because i'd always though that i tell my husband all the time when we have kids
there are some things that you're going to think that are a bit crazy i was telling him that i want
you know i want to give birth in a bath with water with music and he's just like uh huh you're half crazy
hm mm
oh wow
hello
hm mm yea
ooh
oh okay oops sorry it's the dog shh shh quiet
i'm sorry
aha
that's the best yea
ummm
no that that's the best the best method of to make sure the the success of your kid eh maintain all that that's the problem with my husband
and i tell him because his mother was a little weird because she taguht him he left him in front in front of the television always
and i don't think i have a television untils i was thirdteen mi mother and dad did not buy the television we did not have any of that he is the only one that thinks is weird
sorry ah what was the the theme of this call
that i was always very advance in school in the scholar system i was advanced ah i finish university early and he waited for me all i have done i've done it fast
and with easy and i'm not sure about him i always tell him because i did not have all the distrac distractions i did not have a television that took awaya one or two hours
of studies you know that everything was always was focused my mother and father were poor but if one of us wanted to play music my mom and dad did whatever they could so i could go to take music lessons
you know if we were interested on animals we went to the museum
on the weekends or you know there was alaways something about education so one only grows for a short time so when you are already eh a teenager
grows and and sees the difference adn the one's friendships know about this they know about this
and you feel strange but after when you are more more mature now i look and say thanks i always say thanks to my mom my dad thanks a lot because now
i can buy all those things i want if i want an ipod i buy it i have one
if i want uh a playstation we have one there it just sits there gathering dust
because we don't play it it doesn't interest me and my husband says you're not going to sit and play i don't want to play with that either
ah okay well start yes yes you should start
so it's there but i also see the benefit that i didn't waste my youth
hm mm
well nowadays there are a lot of programs
depends no there's there's a lot they have in channel thirteen they have like two that are safe two that have the approval of of the school system here
in new york
hm mm
hm mm
no
hm mm yeah
well i i have faith i don't know you but i have faith that you are going to do a wonderful job because of the way i hear you speak
oh okay
it is all that i in my mind saw and said ok this is what i want to do this is what i want to see and when i talk with my husband he ah
i don't know anymore i don't know but
but it is it is i'm hearing you and i can tell that he is good you know everything you say is perfect no there is nothing
what i would do different like who says

always the places were but too full of people then you went to dane and you almost couldn't dance and people stepped on you or they gave you when they were turning then no well i i got tired of that

and you know where there is a lot of hispanics there is many well the bad friendships starts and all that the bad people
so the americans start to think negatively not him anymore
that is an hispanic they start to think all of them same they think
and since there ain't none they don't have
yes they don't think he is a mexican he is not doing this or that
no i think they haven't haven't experimented with mexicans much
and for that reason there isn't there shouldn't be mexicans well there is no one to do evil deeds
you see that mexicans throw a party one or two am in the morning and with the music as low as possible
and there is nothing of that until now now already soon more hispanics will start arriving

ah
i do i listen music too but i also hear but a lot it's been a long time since i left of listen music and start to listen
problems converstation programs
of policy
but is like after a long time you usually to that and forget of listen music and days go by without listen music
and then you realize that your music i mean the music really change the encourage
for the rest of the day doesn't it
so now i listen more music for have more encorage and energy
because i don't know will be for the latin blood i guess
and you are from from ah where did you say you were from from
but a necessity
it needs that you know that dance music music that
yeah because here i don't hear much of that music or style
you sure
no i like everything now
before when i was in chile i didn't like salsa merengue or anything like that now that i'm here i love it
now all i need to do is learn how to dance no more but i love it
no they don't have it here they don't have anything nothing latino nothing merengue nothing at all here
no because there are very few latinos here
the majority here are only mexicans
puerto rico
but on tv on the radio there is nothing nothing spanish nothing latino
on tv no nothing
no nothing
so we are in the middle of nowhere
yes it is boring
boring when i went to california to visit it was
and how long have you been here
oh long time
i've been living here for ten years this year
still that's not as much but it seems like it no
it's beginning to get cold but no not as much as in chicago
yes that
cristina i am chilean and i'm here in idaho
oh yes i've heard that it's terrible terrible
my brother lives in chicago as well
yea ahm i'm not sure because i don't live there but around the university of chicago
and i think they live real close it seems like the apartments around the university are
so i'm not sure then
yeah music
and well well its like puerto rico what kind of music do you like
bachata whats bachata
ha
oh yeah
how are you
yes yes i've heard it before
and from and from so living in chaicago hasen't made it hard for you to keep listening t othe music you listened to in puerto rico right
because many
well not there is a great variety in chicago
so you haven't missed that a lot have you
great
of course
sure
aha
oh yes yes
are you in chicago right
oh nice
oh
oh really
here in idaho nobody gets here
no
that's cool
oh i see
so you don't feel that far from home right
you have all that
here at idaho we don't have any of that here the only music we had is a little mexican like
oh
i don't know what it's called but it's something like  saltaditas or i don't know what it is
but it's music that i had never heard either over there in chile
and of course over there in chile you listen to more music i don't know like boleros also and
things like that but of course yo miss that here because you don't hear it you don't hear that much of that and nobody comes here either so you don't have a way of
sur
tain or anything like that and i was missing it so much that no i'm listening to satellite radio
and with that i have been able to i have been able to remember now many songs in spanish because after ten years i can lis ten to songs that they are playing right now now
like that regueton and all that
i had no idea of that because i hadn't heard music in spanish since ten years ago
and it's music in spanish
what time is there
ah nice
aha
of course
of course
yes it is it is good to have music in spanish because
because english is rich but it is not the same
but it is not what you have grown up with or anything like that eh
yes i am now happy with with being able to listen to music in spanish again because it really makes a difference
on your mood and all that
to see
what time is there
of course
right
sure
and it would be cheerier right
instead of getting mad well if you´re waiting so long at least you'd dance in the mean time right
yes
seriously
seriously
my
two with this one
oh it is late
yes
wow then you call because i was waiting for a call
but then you can call and wait
oh can you talk more than once a day
once a day
yes last time i talked i talked with my sister because we called at the same time
and my sister lives in atlanta
and i talked to her shes the one that does the recording for this show when you hear a girl talking saying what to do and all that
she she is my sister
so when she did the recording she told me to call so that we could listen and talk to each other that was the only time i talked then i didn't talk more well
here is nine
so this is my first time talking to someone else
yes so i put the batteries and so called because i was waiting for someone to call me but nothing happened
aha
it's scary right
ah yes
ahh
clearly
ahh i see
no i like the theme of music more simple the other time when i was a subject clear of immagraciones i think it was
that makes me more afraid to talk politics and migration
good evening
in the evening
yes
oh yes yes i speak
yes
i don't like politics but i talked about immigration music and marriage
about cell phones well a lot of topics figure out that i'm missing only 9 thanks to god
after the 25 you wait two or three months and they send a check to your house
yes
yes after 5 pm you can call to anyone you can call to the number you have
you have to call and you communicate but it has to after 5 pm because at that time they change
the topic of what you're talking about the topc
wow
well before i talked like 5 times about marketing
i talked with a girl 2 times about music three about marriage and only one about cellphone well a lot of topics
but they didn't change the topics but now that they placed a lady to talk well they changed the subjects
but first you have has to talk well much the topics almost always left the same topics for the people speak
look then ah

its a kind of music its not slow music
nobody really sings that kind of music and alejandra alex bueno me as well have found cds at the library
ok good evening
to hear them i also like regueton i don't know if you listen to regueton its popular now
from  daddy yanky  don omar  tego calderon  ivi queen
no it's not the almost
it's almost the same
aha aha aha
no no because before
ther in puerto rico i listened to'boleros' and'salsa' but i didn't really like'boleros' and'salsa' because you can't dance them
they are more romantic
butt we use'merengue' a lot
like'olga tañonelvis crepo'
fine
and here in chicago there ia a lot of purtorican parade
and they were invited this year came  ivy queen which is the baby of the reggaetton
en 2004 we had elvis
crespo
yeah then
no
here we also have a boricua party which is in september and we had tego calderon there are always a lot of concerts in parks and open air
and they are free there is also something they do a lot which is called  viva chicago
and they bring a lot of colombian music from mexico from all over the world
yes yes
thank you it is a little bit cold and a little hot
yes
yes
aha
no
aha
aha aha
aha
aha aha
ohh because now here in chicago we have a radio station that is nine hundred point one fm
it plays regueton the whole day long
hmm
aha so specially when i'm driving in my car
that you don't get bored because you play the the radio loudly and and the walk is
faster and it doesn't bore you you don't fall asleep in the car or anything
listening to music
aha
no no
aha aha aha
aha
it is like music that i don't know if you hear it did you hear that they have eh ah when they are you are waiting for a person
to grab the phone to talk i don't like that music because eh ah it is music like like classic and it is music like when you go
aha
like when you are on an elevator
that they have music from for me for me
it's not nice and you should change it put merengue or bachata music or the music
uh like like cumbias cumbias are nice
right right right
right right right no it's just well you fall asleep while waiting
look right now i was waiting like fifteen minutes for uh to be communicated
yeah the other time i was waiting for half an hour and when i was going to be communicated to someone they hung up because supposedly it was eleven pm
and they hang up now
right right right
it is eleven minus twenty
how many times have you called
¡oh right i'm on this one
its thirteen
ha
no no they will they will call yeah you can call and then after five o'clock you can call to any oh after five
who ever you want
no no just once
yes
ha
ohh
and there
ha ha
ohh
ohh
oh blessed you are missing a lot if you are missing twentythree
because again we are put to policy
but i call and get put on hold and nobody on the phone nobody nobody
but aha but for me my five in the afternoon every afternoon i called here to someone who
that if i want to grab the phone to talk but as i grabbed the phone because i do not know what topic they are speaking
like this music this is the second time i speak me
i've talked to many people nebraska of philadelphia of miami
i'm tammy once again fine and you oh my god
because she can't have them all and that's bad because if they don't take them like they have to
they are not going to help you so that makes you scared
yes that is mja or welfare
assistance that they give them here because they don't give you much so it is difficult and you have to prove ehh show them that really
you have that but in any case if you do what gives you the thing is that if you are working
and if you don't know they don't pay you well but you they pay you twenty dollars or a little more than twenty dollars from the
or i think less than twenty dollars from the from the limit they give you they don't help you
i say because it is twenty dollars more from the limit they have but i say if that is not too much
and they don't want to so they prefer that you don't work
so they can help you but with the help they give you it is not enough for you to survive
no well here i think that some things are good but others aren't
no then that what they give you good thing they can not they don't help you
they don't want to help you because you make too much supposedly and too much is not so much they can not survive with that and you have to stop working for them to help you
not so much so it's difficult i guess that is rather difficult for people trying to do that that's why you have people who work under the table
because they cant's say what they do because afterwards they don't get enough help and they have children too that is another issue
no no i was standing one day and my son came the mad came home and said to me hey mother why don't you apply to the government so that i get lunches
i say hey we do a lot of stuff so that you get lunches i think that i give you enough that you can buy launches and give him the paper
four children wait four persons in a house want you to make twenty four thousand dollars
that isn't enough a year is not enough
four people no especially when you have a baby
because that is i say it's a lie i was showing to my husband and i said to him that people is mad where you work at and where you live because here where i live
specially about the older people they don't give them enough money it's not about the money but they need medical help they don't fully pay for their pills
that is my son when he moved miraculously found an apartment near the place we live in like seven hundred twentyfive a month and that' cheap
mja no that it didn't had nothing of that so you can imagine and with the two
so i say if a person has four people at home and they earn twenty four thousand they can't they can't
so to me that's why i always talk to my children be careful with your credit score save money
because aha do you remember that i spoke to you yesterday
my son is now back to our house the older one moved back with us he had a fight with his girlfriend and the girlfriend did something bad to him and this man my son when you do something bad to him he just waives goodbye to you and he will never see you again
so he took his stuff and my husband went there and helped him pick up his stuff and he left nothing in that apartment
so that's
aha very bad this man he called me on the phone and said mom and i told him that i was going to support him and so i told him to come back here and i'm going to try and get him to go back to school because
yes but now i want him well people in his job told him that he was allowed to go to school during the mornings
then it's harder for them you know to take their pills because they have to think  i have to pay for the pills or i have to eat
and work in the afternoon they are helping him so i told him that if he was moving back home he would've to go back to school and that way i wouldn't ask him to pay me a rent
but if you don't go to school you are going to have to pay rent because i want him to finish school
because it goes i say a lot of things specially with him if he doesn't want to finish school it will be hard for him to get stuff so i want
mja so then oh yes yes because that is what i say to him because later something happens to you and you don't do it feels like you are going to finish asking for help and you are not going to get any you are a man i mean
it's not necessary he is so young to not finish his things we can help him here and he won't accept it
i always put the example of the people we know look you don't want to end up there work hard
mm no yes and how it is over there in canada with him with this of the insurance
mja
yes mja yes
yes
because they have to pay more and sometimes sometimes there are also abusive people i know some people that well they're not my friends but i know they're abusing
yes
no i don't know i we when my husband came out of he used to be in the air force
so we arrived here and he neither they pay so much that was like in ninety two
and then when we arrived here there wasn't enough to pay the rent so we got into it for a month
to have enough to help us and for the time it took him to get a job so it took him a month
well a month to get a job but you know the next check so we took that month and we got out right away from there but when you go to the shop with those the one of these that they give you that are like fake pieces of paper
people yes when you go to buy that was years ago so maybe now i think they give you a card
but people look at you the wrong way
aha that that yes because not because not because they are giving you aid you look like you can work yes we can work but they didn't have and i was with two little ones i say i can't work right away because where would i live the little ones that i have to pay someone and i don't have money to pay them
and then i told my husband never again never
abusing people that really that other people really need
i say i work where there is before i'm stuck in that and always he has told me that i lower and i do not put my family that way
so that because it's like they look at you bad i say no man because you are asking for a little help
because no puno he left you those things fine or but it's very difficult
uh huh they don't remember people don't remember that
but i no i am not that way when i see people that have the need i say to anyone it could happen one day to another it happened to me
so that and good ah i say
mja well what i say they are not stealing they didn't decide to go crazy and steal they are
they went for what they had to go and ask for help and maybe they didn't even want to do it but they had to do it
mja
no no ah eh which which well they send you a check
right but it's hard i have my sister in law my husband's mother
well this was in ninetytwo it is that i remember they send you a check and then they send you a little book
little that they had like those of money monopoly
and i made like five dollars twenty dollars and you had to take it out from there and give it to the person and they didn't give you eh change back
it is that you had to try to have all that that was appropriate because what i say no i say that it is
mja and then had to they wanted to be sure that you don't use it on alcohol so that looks bad i say they should i think that now with that the card they have
and she has partial assistance but no they don't help her too much and she has to she has to search for coupons and stuff like that to see if she can buy her medicines in another place to make it cheaper or
buy this medicine this month or buy another medicine next month
betsy hi how are you
right no
and and that is the welfare or pension or
oh or that is aha i imagine
mja
mja
ha
ok
aha
but already but they don't pay you let's say all the medicine you need
aha
i'm sitting here let's see what can you tell me about the social security or whatever because i have no idea
and the help they provide isn't sufficient anyway there is
aha aha
but after eighteen years you don't get any help when your children turn eighteen you don't get any help
mja
aha
aha
twenty four thousand a year oh my goodness for four souls no
aha
mja
mja but it doesn't include utilities
right right
aha oh okay that's clear
aha it's not enough
aha i see don't waste it in things you don't need
yes aha he moved back in
boy
i see
that girl must have done something pretty bad to him mm
well yes when he moved out to live with his girlfriend he had no job oh aha
aha
ah that's good aha
oh
yes of course mja
mja or to have a good career also they are not going to send him to work to a mcdonald's forever
mja
mja
no he doesn't want because he doesn't want to have the government doesn't help him at all
well here they make him work me when we got here from el salvador which was fifteen years ago and we were given we were leased an apartment
bed and this couch and this but we were with the welfare
for a few months there because we would go to school and from there my parents got a job and my brother and i were in high school
and from there since my parents were working and they received help for my brother because he was fifteen years old i think
and me already and i already had eighteen and they didn't receive help for me only for my brother but i got in high school and didn't work until
right oh
yes but they entered me in the welfare sometimes i would enter but i think that here they help you a little more because they give you a card for medicines
mha and this and you have to present it at the shop where you're going to buy the medicine and and they pla pay well it was like that the last time that i asked for assistance
but now ah now i don't know how it is it must be harder
aha mha
aha
aha
that's good
really
oh aha
they look at you as if you're from another planet
right
mha aha yeah true
no
no
like what mja
now of security them they it happened the same and they look at you bad it's that way
mja
oh yeah of course
because looking poorly upon people who have government aid which really helps is not a great thing
aha ok
mja mja and that that it was like a little piece of paper that says that the government helps you and people know
right
it is not money i mean they don't send you a check to your house or to your account
mja
aha
oh oh
oh no
and the government that they did it to embarrass you

i'm expecting another baby in two weeks
uh um
i want it to be healthy
fine and you
uh um
no
a little tired yes but god permit in a few weeks two or three weeks when i have the baby i will feel better
fine and you
yes
and you have some children
ah
wow
why
mm
a girl
she is goinh to be 2 years old november 18th
mmm
no she is really good she has her episodes yo know about not doing what i say to her
annie
but
when i talk to her and ask her to do something she does it because if she doesn't you know i make sure she does it
because i want her to you know be well behaved
so
let's say she doesn't have a chance to be bad
yes with my husband
ah
yes
no
i don't know
in miami
so you know the only thing we're hoping is that it will be healthy
ah no today it wasn't very hot well it was hot but cloudy so it was quite breezy but probably temperature was on eighty eightyfive eightysix on that range
but humidity wasn't high so it wasn't a very very hot day
because what it have little effect here not just temperature
but humidity then we have usually i think so i think about seventy eighty percent of humidity
and when you left home
you know as soon as you left you start to sweat because it's like somebody is hitting you with a wet sheet
you know it's very sticky and
but now we are entering on a not so bad season it's hot but humidity drops a lot
but you know for example i can not wash my hair
oh
ah and i can be all night with wet hair
it's not dry because there's a lot of humidity
and i wash it in the morning i go out and then i tie it up with a little bow in a bow
so my hair is wet all day long
so you know it's not always the heath but the humidity i believe
so what is it cold there now or not yet
wow
so when do you normally have snow over there
when do you normally have snow when does it start to snow when does the snow season begin and all that
so eh but when does the snow season begin
oh no never i've never been
why i thought you had snow in new york
didn't you told me that you were eh live in new york
okay
i believe okay
okay no i was thinking that it was snowing in new york that's why i asked you
oh sorry
no no eh mi parents are from em dominican republic
but i was born in puerto rico
and my father too
and puerto rican too
oh twenties
mhm
hmm
aham from haiti
yes from haiti
from haiti
from jamaica
i don't think so i mean we have a house but my husband is the only one that works and we have to you know
no we don't have a luxury life
ah we have enough money for what we need to buy food pampers
you know pay the the the light whatever but we don't have we don't have anything for vacations you know any of that
wow
we have what we need but
you know and we only have a car we don't have two cars and here normally the people have
two cars
no we only have one car
no we have a house but for here it's a pretty small house
eh we have three bedrooms
and two baths it's nothing big and here the houses are very very expensive very expensive
so you know what have what we need
but it is not a luxurious life
we don't have you know we're not hungry and we don't need clothes
so you were born in new york
but since i don't work i stay home with my girl
it's quite hard
i believe that is possible it has been more than a year since the last time i bought some clothes to the little girl
and you know we saved a lot of money but i do not go to the stores i don´t shop a lot
no shopping because the clothes is very expensive
when we want to buy some clothes we go to costcos
Ó maybe sams or something like that
look for our sizes and if it fits we buy it
but i am not a big fan of the stores i don´t do that
you know as long as i have clothes to put on i don´t cared about the brand
hello
yes oh well we have to talked about trips where have you travel
because they are are three trips three flights i mean no there is no money left to go to any place then i believe after i finish the school and i going to take a
a free time vacations before starting to work for
yes or to or to go to some place where i want to go to a place that is different no not to go to see my family
mhm yes yes and generally when you start working they don't let you take vacations for some time
there are places where the first three months you can not take vacations and others where the first six months you can not take vacations
then yes how is your baby

mm
mhm
aha
su
mhm
mhm
but ah when you went to arizona when you've been to arizona did you go sightseeing or only to
yes did you go to the grand canyon
hi
aha did you like it
yes yes
of course yes
mm and you have only gone to mexico to visit your family or to visit other places also
aha
mm
mm
mm
mm
mm
fine and you
and would you like to visit any other country in the world
alaska
mmm
it is very cold there
mmm
yes my um the boss i had before went to antarctica i mean the south pole
yes to see the penguins because penguins are only in the south pole
and ah and she loved it there are cruise ships you can take to go to alaska you take it in california and they take you all the way to alaska
and then you get to see all the glaciers and all the
mmm
are you working right now
ah indeed no
time and money costs
yes yes it's difficult no it's it's to me
aha
no no let me know where you were going
clearly mhm
mhm
mhm
yes
clearly yes balance is difficult to see family and go on vacation but when you get married because then you have to go see family and tue
oh
family of the wife or the husband
then there time is running out and the and the vacations and the money and everything goes on that
yes yes
mhm
mhm yes of course
mhm
mhm
of course yes
yes yes i love to travel i hope now that i start to work as a nurse and that i started to have money to be able to travel
to the to where i want to go but yes i eh i've been in europe and and i've been in costa rica and guatemala i've been in mexico but only in mexico city
oh of course
in puerto vallarta and in chiapas
ah i was in eh in san cristóbal and ah where else was i in chiapas in eh i don't remember but ah and i was in ah in taxco too when i was
yes when i was in mexico
yes i have a friend who loves to travel she loves to travel and to stay a lot in other countries she just came back from staying two years in
in taiwan and when i met her in mexico she had been six months in mexico and then she was visiting the whole country
and i met her when she was in chiapas then we went to san cristobal and guajaca and then we went to taxco and we came back
i came back she stayed
ah from ciudad de mexico ah well she was studying
she was studying then what she did was to take the classes as an independent student then while she was studying and taking classes she was traveling all over mexico
yes yes and then when i ten trips with her i spent almost nothing because we stayed in hostels i don't remember how you call them
a rest oh
but you can stay there you stay there but you have to sleep in a room with a lot of people no but you pay we didn't pay we paid like
two dollars or three dollars per night
but they're almost all students i mean you have to share the room with people you don't know but
no yes it's people that
who is doing the same as
they come to travel yes and they don't want to spend a lot of money and then they stay like that and uh that was good but i also went to europe and i stayed a month in
traveling through europe but that was very expensive but my parents helped me because it was my university graduation present then yes but after that when i was here in houston
i've only gone to aruba which is in venezuela's northern coast
yeah and it's it's a little island like puerto rico but i didn't like it it's a a very famous tourist destination in the caribbean but i didn't like it
because puerto rico is an island too and puerto rico has a lot more green and mountains and this island aruba it's a desert there's nothing
fine fine you are working in construction you told me that right
absolutely nothing they only thing is that the beaches are very pretty but besides the beaches there's nothing else to see
in aruba yes
it's really dry there's nothing absolutely nothing it's really flat and the only thing there are rock it's really rocky
the beaches are rocky too
yes the sand is white and the water is very clear and you can see through the water it's a really clear blue
but but no nothing else to do absolutely nothing else
so i didn't like it because of that but yes i'm lucky that my whole family lives in puerto rico except a sister i have who lives in florida
the the rest are in puerto rico but nove even like that and now for example this year i went to see my sister in florida and later in in august
and after i went to puerto rico to see my family and now in december i am going to canada to visit the family of my fiancee
then thes is no more time or money to go to any other place
hi
well the best each one can do right
uh yes to mexico
only to mexico and here and here in the united states i´ve been to different places
uh on vacations not work on vacations
uh
in texas
when i was in texas i would travel from there to here
i have family here and there
now that i´m here to i´m going there or nebraska with my bro my brother that is there
i also have family in arizona all my uncles
ah this is manuel from
all uh almost all the family on the side of my mother is here in the united states
besides that in other states i have one in wisconsin so i sometimes go there too
it's kind of close
so what can i say when you have time you can travel by car i like it i like to drive here
because you can stop along the way whenever you want to get some rest
with family you've got to stop to rest
if you take the bus it only stops once and it's pretty uncomfortable
just like that
ah grand canyon
yes
chicago how are you
oh it's pretty
is very pretty even though is very like is a very desert area
but it has many pretty things
well i have family in two states in durango and in monterrey
oh monterrey has many oh is is like what can i tell you well yes it has many tourist places where you can go for a stroll get to know
is an industrial city there are many well what can i tell you there are a lot of things that you can there aren't over there there aren't things like that but is very pretty
it has like i don't know exactly what they are like rivers one is called the horse's tail
they are like this huge high waterfalls
that a lot of people from different parts visit it also
is very pretty
fine fine working
oh yes i would like to visit alaska
yes
going to to know what is the
eh what the exactly what real coldness is
i would like to be there
really
yes
yes i have known something about it
yes yes i would really like to get to know that place
but sometimes there is no time
yes
and when
when you have time sometimes you have no money
what happens is
as yes tell me
oh what happens is i tell you like when you're on vacation one which then well at least i ah eh treatment
but go out where my family going to visit my family at times ah
drive two or three years without seeing them
i prefer to have a chance as well of course seeing my family walking also because it is not
eh us as we are very close much less frequent
and therefore better there is sometimes you have to do better make plans to go see the family better
yes the phone ringed and i took the call well just to entreating myself a little bit take a little rest
oh talking about that that's another problem
yes then better the time because the ah i'll tell you that i don't spend much money when you go to see the family i don't spend much like when you go to
i don't know that you're going to travel to know different ah cities or country
there yes you spend more because you have to spend hotels food
and logical you're going to know where you want what you go you go spending money
to go out with the to visit the family yes you spend i don't tell you that no but
you don't spend as much
it's very different
how good
oh yes
eh
oh taxco
on vacation
yes i with vacation
oh
hmm that's nice
hmm
but at least you know you're in with people there is no danger on the contrary over there
they are pe
ah exactly people who are doing the same thing
okay
how are you
is it a desert there
yes
yes
look at that
hmm
well yes
to rest
well that is good because just starting working if your are just beginning and don't know how is going to be for you well practically it is going to change your life rythm
mhm
look
yes
oh very good thanks
yes that is good growing growind from the day he was born he was born on wednesday on saturday she had a appointment with the pediatrician we take her
and it gained almost one pound
we were talking with the doctor no i was talkng with him awhile he was telling us everything that its very good that he have fattend because many children
when they born in regular they tend to thin a little to lose weight
and this girl don't lose weight to the contrary he won weight
yes its very well
mmm so i hope he keeps like that and i don't have problems
yes
ah betsy you are indeed talking with alex again how are you
and to gibraltar i liked it a lot but the south of spain where all the beaches are
they robbed me in in the underground train
they took my wallet
and they took like one hundred dollars
yeah maybe more how in spain
and in colombia where its very famous for those things
rapone never happened because it is one of the reasons he was always most preventable
and spain when one is prevented
yes yes and also know that recently there was an act of terrorism there
if some trains operating put some bombs and some people were arab terrorism
and people died in spain and this happened at the stations where i was
eh those landscapes were beautiful
few years ago i walked in those places where the act occurred
a year ago
yes then you know it what it's going to happen if something bad
i will not go wrong no matter where you are
but i didn't had the money to stay too much
and that it always gave me frustration if i only won a prize with all that money
and the time too of course when you have the money you need the money too
and then i would love to travel to spain and visit the
there are lots of castles and interesting stuff there
ah lot of things from the old world lot of roman things ah very interesting knowing the history
but you need money it's an expensive country especially if you want to travel
yes and no it isn't that dangerous from where i am columbia is dangerous
well yes well the subject is travels
one does not enjoy a beautiful country which is
always in fear for the security of the country
no spain is better
dangerous
yes
columbia is a fantastic country if there weren't any soldiers
you have a scenery and some very big mountains
yes and we also have a coast but the problem still is the army and the
and the drug trafficking already damaged this country completely and the image that it has i can imagine it's horrible
if what else enter united states if you like to travel or canada
yes something interesting
yes i have listened that it is pretty but cold
yes
where do you live
not snow
impossible
you are near to the north never falls snow
yes
because here in los angeles never falls snow at least you go to the mountains
yes
but if it falls should falls because betsy is well north
yes i've had many different opinions
yes you're near alaska
yes near seattle washington
do you know seattle washington
i'd like to know over there
yes and also washington dc i went to the capital once
it has beautiful things museums history i like everything about history and and one classical city is montreal canada
they say canada is beautiful
and no there isn't insecurity as much as here in the united states
here at the states it's ugly
it's almost almost like latin countries now
well do you want to start this time
yes that's why they critizise the immigration here because its a lot of immagration and theyre bad
and it has damaged the country a lot
a a a throughout the years i've seen this country really go down and today in united states there is a lot of differences between poor and rich
this was not the case before in canada i think there is more balance
hay there is not a lot of difference between poor and rich in canada like here in the united states
but there are more social pro programs there
and there is not that many people the problem here is that there is a lot of people
yes the country has gone down regretfully yes a lot ahh
yes and its drangerous
they can rob you they can do something there is a lot of misery its kind of like a latin country no i don't see a lot of difference
and why
yes and you know latin countries are known for the difference between rich and poor people
and that's how that is how the united states is transforming
yes but there there there is interesting stuff and i once went to texas and i liked the scenery i
i have always liked the colombian plains
super hot but very pretty
and the texan plains look like that a little more developed and i like the roasted meat
and a lot of roasted meat was bought at places like that
it is interesting i would like to know more about texas
because of the scenery mostly because of the plainsi like the plains the plain the cowboysi like them
and the barbecues
is your husband canadian
i love the roasted stake how they say in colombia the stakes
and you encounter that allot in texas
yes yes i think the most interesting part in united states especially seattle is known for it's coffee they say it's a good coffee
yes yes
you have volcanoes there yes
i remember that there are really good views there
have security
yes that is the problem of all the latin countries they never managed to overcome
yes hopefully one day could make l
yes but i heard that vacations out there are beautiful for the volcanoes
yes a cruise ship would be fantastic
and mountains do you know the beaches in salvador how are they
what are  olotas waves o what
because there is pacific coast and also atlantic coast yes
how many seas does it have only pacific
yes
yes
because colombia has the atlantic and also the pacific colombia has two seas
that is why it is a really beautiful country more beautiful than many countries
as a country is the worse but has a lot of beauty
maybe because it has many queens
well i once went on a trip to spain
but there are lots of bad things
yeah there's lot of thing i don't deny it one cant deny the truth about
about a situation there are also bad things
not only that there is also insecurity and um
and when somebody does tourism one wants to go to a place that nothing bad will happen to them
right one wants to visit a place where there's not so much insecurity
i'll tell you one thing that will frighten you
i've never gotten robbed in colombia
and i told you about spain how they stole from me in spain
yeah that's true
betsy yeah oh hi alex
yes a cruise ship because i've never been i've never traveled on a cruise ship before and you
really
that's weird
ha
oh no
wow and that was in spain
in spain and not colombia

hi hello good night where are you from
oh fed up and talking about travelling have you ever travelled to puerto rico
oh yes
then you have not always been in colorado you travelled oh you just travelled for holidays
oh no yet not a lot yet just utah and i don't know just utah really i went to washington
to washington yeah but not not in the east of courseone day i hope to be able to
oh to study
we came here after my graduation from the school to study at the university here
well went to utah and there i met my husband and now we live in idaho
but but we went back to chile once five years ago and
we hope we will be able to go back you know maybe next year
from colorado and originally
oh not that much but it's more expensive from idaho i believe than if we were in florida or california i colorado is in the north right
in the middle oh ok then a bit downer but more to the middle
oh then it will be a bit easier to travel
aha
oh no really
oh sure that's why we never go to any place because only the eh anything will cost about three hundred dollars or so each ticket it's very expensive
yes have you ever travelled abroad like to europe or something like this or you never ahd the chance
really
which country which country would you travel to if you had the chance
to yes to australia
oh i'm in idaho and i'm from chile
yes loo yes for me if i could choose i think it would be italy
yes i don't know to italy yes i believe that italy but australia it is huge australia there is so much to do
oh
and of course
oh then you are going to be
of course at least for another fifteen years no
of course when she no longer wants anything to do with me for a while no
of course no now it is difficult
yes we have small children also and that makes it difficult to travel anywhere
sure ah
in the united states 10 years in idaho three
ah so you're going to take her there but at what age more or less are you thinking of taking her
aha
a look so she's constantly
mhm
sure
i can imag
sure
oh yes i can imag how old was she
oh tiny she didn't understand yet of course
aha
yes a lot well it's like colorado with a lot of snow
ah yes that's much
no but good that she likes to travel because so she will want to travel after because there are people who really do not like traveling and y can't believe that
they do not like traveling
sure
sure and we have to take responsibility for the children
set foot on land for a while
i heard it is super slow
many forests no
how long have you been living there in colorado
wow
of course
mhm
mhm
ah and she was american or where was she from
ah
oh yea
right well it's that a person changes a lot right
in those years
right
ah yes oh and that one her is from mexico
aha
of course and puerto rico is not like that right
mhm
what strange no yes she is very nice
now where does she live
aha with the girl
ah then you can see her frequently
ah look how nice
look how good
and it is going to be nice now when you are from puerto rico and you don't have any problem coming in and out of the united states right
i've never understood why what role does puerto rico play to the united states because it is not a state it is a separate country but at the same time
aha
oh but no now
oh not so long ago
clearly
oh
independent
and how long have you been there
goo night i'm joe
no never
oh i have been here many years more than 20
look since 93 when my parents died it was the last time that i went to puerto rico but i have gone to other places gone to mexico
i have gone to other places other places in the us also including florida which is
one of my favorite places
and for holidays to other states there is a lot to see here i don't know if yo had the chance to see other places here in the us
but there are lots of nice places
washingon state that is really beautiful over there
how did you land in idaho
ah
from colorado
yes
great
and
and it's so difficult to travel around due to passport matters and so
sure it's more or less in the middle we are a bit downer than you
yes it's a flight center from here there are many flights to southamerica as well
yes if i decide to spend my vacations in cancun for instance
and went there for three days with about three hundred and fifty dollars
that would include flight and hotel acomodation yes
probably it would be easier for you to go to washington or go to a most centric place and fly from there to elsewhere
from puerto rico
no i would love to go to europe my two brothers one lives in wichita kansas and the other in puerto rico they do travel a lot
they've been all over europe and they have told me how beautiful it is over there paris sapin
well i would like one of my favourites is australia
yes and i would love australia because it is rather exotic there and also new zealand but i would also like to visit italy spain france all those places but i believe that the number one for me continues to be australia
italy yes italy is beautiful
there is a lot of history yes well i i worked for a company where the president of the company he is an australian and owner also of the company then there we became good friends and all that
and he always invited me to go there but i have a fiveyearold daughter i am a divorced dad
and i have shared custody
then
i would never abandon i would never leave behind
chile nice how long have you been there
yes yes when she forgets she has a dad and and she starts thinking more about boyfriends yes
yes yes but until now well i am crazy about her and she is crazy about me and
we have a great time
yes exactly well i want to go to puerto rico next year so that she gets to know her puerto rican half because her mom is mexican
so i want her to know that and she's crazy about going and to see her grandma her grandma comes here every year and they get along really well they have good chemistry between them
she well she has traveled many times by plane
ah she has traveled more that i in the last three years because she goes to mexico with her mother at least twice a year
oh she's very used to traveling she's very quiet i'll tell you that once we were traveling well it wasn't it wasn't by plane but when i travel to wichita
i went once by greyhound and it was a horrible experience because she was still very little and when she got on the bus
she was asleep but when she woke up completely she panicked
10 years oh do you like it do you miss a lot your home
i think that she though that she was having the worst nightmare and people there were very uncomfortable and they told me things
and it was a very bad trip but
she was about two then
and i promised her that never again going to take her in one of those buses we call it bus
then then next time we went on a plane a small plane we had a good day and she was very happy not to mention that it was only
an hour's flight compared with thirteen hours by bus
yes
it was horrible
i would love to see the entire planet if i could
i love to travel as much as possible but actually it's hard for me because of the economic situation
and it changes a lot this season changes from
yes exactly
yes exactly yes but has if given the opportunity to go to other parts come to colorado because is very nice
is beautiful come here
has many national forests many majestic mountains a lot of places of attractions in the city a lot have a bit of everything but if you come here to the mountains and go to sites that are great you will see that beauty like you're in paradise
i've been living here twenty six years
in december it'll be twenty six years yea well yea i came right here well i stopped for a bit in new york for a short time
so i came here with my ex first wife
so we were married for about ten years and then each one went their own way
but uh she's half puerto rican and half swiss
she was my my high school sweetheart
cold to hot or from hot to cold
yes well we got along well and it ended well we just realized that we had different goals in the end
you can change a lot yea yes
the girl's mom well it was a really short marriage
it didn't even last two years
yes she is from oaxaca mexico
but we have a good relationship as parents with the girl we work very well toghere with her in fact today we went to her school to the kindergarten

she has a voice so sweet that everybody loves
she has she behaves very well she is very respectful it is a she has a lot of love for god ans she has you know good principles and she is hungry for learning

puerto rico it's almost the same weather all the year but it has it's rainy moments and it's sunny days during the year
she lives very close from here i live in aurora colorado y she lives three miles from here
yes i see her three times a week all weeks more in other activities like today for example well
we shared together with her
yes that is good
not at all
well it was invaded by the americans in 1898
it started when the spanish settled there then governed by americans and from there it was under control until they started putting puerto rican governors in charge
as in 1950 fiftyfour they gave the citizenship to all puerto ricans
but puerto rico it was not so long ago for example my parents were not born there as citizens but i have been a citizen all my life
in then thereafter because it emerged that the commonwealth has a free association with the united states without being a state
july might be really sunny and may really rainy
beyond the primary vote the vote beyond the primary for president here but not voted by the president for elections from here
so in some ways they're independent in some ways they have a lot
a dependence or union with the united states would be very difficult for puerto rico to make a fully independent country because
it would have to be approved first there and it has never been approved nor does it have approval
good evening mildred from connecticut
mmm
what type of music do you listen to
rock and all this ah
reggaeton and all that
ah
yes i yes i listen to everything reggaeton rap everything
rock i don't like i hear it but i don't like it for a long time for a little bit okay but a whole night listening to rock no
i'm not really a rocker
but if the bachata merengue salsa all that's music classical music
romantic music nice yes i find that if all the towns know the music they know people in all different countries
mildred
and
ha ha
i think that if lots of people even if their different nationalities there are mexican people that like salsa there's people that
that are from different countries that like salsa merengue yea bachata when ones dances it
oh
there's so many countries dancing it
i like mexican music because it has a good rhythm specially in northern music i love them yes
i like them a lot
yeah ha
yeah very beautiful very beautiful and the chinese too chinese music
where are you from arturo
yes especially i mean if one knew how to interpret it it would be more beautiful because they're almost always eh presenting like histerically when presenting their presentations with the women moving their hands
yes and the fans
they use it like like to tell a story
then without arri going to previous times indians did their their
their dances and everything and they were and the the slaves were the first that used the music to to like to explan like to be able to say
how bad they were treated with that they expressed all their their
their discomfort
i think that the music will always always go on centuries and centuries and it will always be there you know
even if it's different on the uh on the kind they choose they're always going to unite people because wherever you go well you listen a reggaeton and you already know who was it and sometimes
i do not know id you remember there was a japanese band the light band
oh okay we have already spoken haven't we
they started to play
yes and they were japanese and they were here a long time i do not know what happened to them lately but they used to play a lot in new york a no they did not have original discs but they played of these
same salsa discs they made the music in japanese
o i am sure if a japanese came to america they would say well i heard that song
although i did not understand what they say but
mhm i believe the music is beauiful and relaxing
one uses it to relax
i have records even from coqui from puerto rico with that music that they tape in the river
for one to relax
when you want to spend some calm time at home you can light those little scented candles and relax that helps a lot
sorry
hmm yes and you need music you need it because maybe if we didn't have music people would be like
even a little more aggressive too
because music has a calming effect
yeah
hmm
oh
and how do you say it they extradited him from the country they they
yes because it was what they call protest music right
in puerto rico they had el topo el topo and who did sing protest song too juan manuel serrat did sing protest songs and sometimes when they made concerts they didn't want to let them do it you know
because as they sang the truth about the working class
yes
against the government and all that they
they tried to boycott it and that people didn't attend it
but is interesting because that tell stories
mhm yeah i agree i think that
as i i tell you i think music is very much needed
tell stories about love tells disgraces tells people troubles
the daily life is used to a lot of things
yeah i think that i love the music i think that when when i put it on i clean the house faster
no you see i always liked piano and my daughters took some piano lessons but i really never had a chance because my mom had no money to pay for piano lessons for me
i like guitar and harp
puerto rican mmm
harp it's an instrument it's not that used now but i really like it
harp sounds beautiful i like i also like accordion music i like it too
aha now in puerto rico they use it the people it's what we call gicaro de campo when people go out to party in christmas they use it
but you don't play any instruments
my boyfriend plays bass well he used to play it not any more he's older now
but
he used to play in a band and in orchestras he used to play the bass
mmh
ok it relaxes you
ok that is good
today it is the music
that is good i lea here we have many
because he he does dj
he does dj so there is music all over the house
and then he is on the internet all the time recording discs and
and we make discs for people if they want
sometimes we have done parties and we make it is what he records a dc full of songs and we give it to the person
aha
ok
do you like it
hello how are you what's your name
do you play an instrument or
well everything music jazz a little bit of classical music but i also listen to a lot of i don't know this popular music and also alternative and fusions like
fusion of jazz and funk
you listen to a little bit of everything
no do you like reggaeton
do you like reggaeton
yeah
no i am i'm really a rocker
yes
yes yes but
mildred i'm arturo
recently i think that this has lost also how music now is so mainstream like for example the hip hop that now everyone in the world is making the same music
in the united states in mexico in every wave they are only imitating like if its turned into something global
the whole world listens to it i don't really like it but i've seen how the how world is adapting to hiphop
inside music i think its like regueton therea a big change as well
in mexico mexican music is using lots of hip hop and there are more rock banks that use hip hop
yes
yes yes
i like dancing merengue and salsa as well
yes
yes northern music
um i'm from mexico but right now i'm in philadelphia
yeah they're good i like them too but sometimes i dont i want to learn international music like
i've heard music like arabian music or turkish music once
its interesting its good as well
yes yes
yes yes yes yes
aha well then everyone like tells something with the music too i mean in every way the music that has no lyrics it's still telling it's painting like an image i mean like
like a scenery it has lyrics then it's always like telling something or relating to a feeling or a history i mean the be the mexican music like the corridos
are very well known because they tell stories don't they of different people of different things that have happened but they're histories well very original very good some times
yes
yes
it might be
aha
yes yes yes
of course
yes ja
yeah
no no that yes
japanese oh
no i never heard them
sure
yes yes also
i think so i don't where are you from puerto rico
very relaxing to enjoy
ah
yes
yeah yes like pure environmental sounds or that are
yes no because music is
even music that's uh aggressive can help you blow off some steam also music can be very important for venting just like
there's a singer that's called there's afrobid music his name is cela kuti and this man well for him nigeria's civil war
it was very important because him with all his music he made the revolution's movements i mean people didn't see him as a musician but as a political leader
that he moved people through his music then when he released new cds
the the army got mad and sometimes he he had a whole community of like followers who had the same political philosophy he did
yes i have spoken with you
and they all lived together in communities and then he released a cd called zombi criticizing the army because they were like a puppet of the government that were
like killing their own people
he said all these things in his song and the army heard it
yes yes they kicked him out they they put him in jail and beat him up and burned his house and all
exactly the music
aha yes of course
yes is yes
people were rioted a lot and the government dislike it
yes
yes it clear that it is engraved in history aswell the music will always reflect what is people living and what is thinking at the moment
it was my turn to talk about i don't remember whatwait i do remember now it is the music
yes so good
yes always
yes
yes yes all mhm yes yes yes i think it's is essential as essential as air i think we couldn't live without
and yes do you play music do you play any instrument
yes
oh harp
yes it's not that in fact i used to have a friend in school that played the harp really beautifully yes
yes but yes like you said mexican music uses a lot of accordion sounds
yes yes yes
yes the music is good isn't it
i play the guitar and i tried playing the bass for a while but it was really hard i couldn't i wasn't able to
so i stopped
aha
yes
it's always good to play music i believe
it also helps me to blow off steam when when i want to get distracted and then well i grab my bass and play a little and
i distract myself it relaxes me
yes
mmh
ah
a lot
ah ok
yes
aha
yes
to parents hes my uncle does something similar i mean he also he was like dj
but now he doesn't work much in that he is doing other job but he also record
goodnight i am joe
well well growing getting very nice and sweet
listen you have
sorry continue
oh i remember about that
yes
yes crime can happen anywhere
that's sad that you
yes and don't be too trusting of some people strangers in particular
i i always teach my daughter not to trust strangers and to be very careful
yes and you start to teach them not to touch here or there and
yes
oh yes really so little and she tells me whe she asks me when can she have a boyfriend i tell her it's going to be a very long time my little child before that's possible
yes more or less i could be
that speaking of tonight's topic
well denver is a city that's considered big but eh w
i live in aurora which is next to denver
it's also a city and it's fairly well populated but it doesn't have the highrises as denver
i wouldn't say it was quieter i would say it was
because it has a mix of everything
of good people of bad people of all ethnic groups there are crime is fairly high here and on lives it seems with a bit of fear
how are you cristina
so yes i used to live in a house before now i live in an apartment and and i have found several nasty situations around here
including shooting and thing like that
well yes yes if i could leave i would like a place that is much more peaceful in a town
because i am really tied of the city in fact i drive here everyday in the traffic in denver is horrible
too many cars too many and and where i live my daughter ah where she goes to school well it's really far sometimes in the morning it takes me an hour and half to drive before going to work
yes a little bit once you get to work you are already under stress
and you have a headache yes
yes
is it a town
yes
i am from puerto rico but i live here in denver colorado
yes over there yes
yes
yes
yes
and how is crime and those things
oh that's nice
in auroram things don't work in that way
they are not related to crimes or something like that
wow that's really really nice
i'm moving right now to be your neighbor
oh i have a lot i have about twentysix years here
it's the complete opposite of denver
and aurora aurora
yes
no the people in colorado also eh mm eh here nmm we like to go to the mountains of camping of all that
but here there are people from all different places and
make places that that the people have come from they have brought many bad habits also
so well things happen that one lives in terror
with my daughter i always live in fear because there is much always they speak on the news about crime happening in aurora
that yes the shootings the robberies that that they run over a child and that the driver went on the run
things like that
yes and you
excuse me
yes
and cars and the cars here you leave cds
or anything because they break the crystal to steal them
the cds and
i never leave anything that calls attention to my car
ay that's great i dream about a place like that the only thing is that like
i have and i am a divorced dad my daughter
she and i have eh i mean we my exwife and i have shared custody
yes i i would never want to leave my daughter behind i want to stay with her here until she grows up
ten years where are you from
and she told me one day oh dad i am going to get married and she forgets me i hope not but i know that sometimes that happens
well spend a lot
but nothing i would like if you live in a quieter place my brother lives in kansas
and very little calm over there too
we do festivals people are not calm
yes there are many beautiful things here is not ugly or anything but
is that because so many people living there and more people moving and and the city is there are cities in colorado are among the most growing throughout america
eh that too has its problems
yes
yes
hadn't i spoken with you the other night
no it's the opposite here here you have the
yes
yes
and the well the the many parts around here it's quiet and there you have all sorts of attractions for the family
for adults for singles everything in truth there are many things here in fact where i work it's a zone with many high tech companies of
so also there's even an amphitheater about a block away from where i work and sometimes we hear concerts from where i work
from the building
yes or no that is not lacking here the only thing is that sometimes the it's particularly in the city where i live that there is too much crime here i would like
there are other parts of of right here the border zones of of that are fairly quiet and
and good neighborhoods even thought they have many people but they take good care of each other and and as you say they keep their cars open and they are not afraid that they would be robbed or anything like that
yes i think so you have a family a husband and children
in this that is like the limit of is a mixture of bad and good
understand and the smug well the are the ones that like to take advantage
and you like like in fear and peaceful
but the traffic is horrible let me tell you
is is horrible because sometimes the taxis during winter days is even worse because when these accidents start you can't move in the highway
is terrible
but i always dream of a peaceful place someday i think that or rather is going to be possible in in
she lives very close like one not even two miles away from here
in what is my house mm and also from my exwife's house well that used to be my house they got in also once they broke in by the
the because the house has three levels
yes a little girl five years old
and the the like the basement like that like that is not a basement that had windows above
then they came through the back part and in the basement i mean the lower part and they stole a bunch of things from her
no she had gone with someone from work i went to the house and examined and advised her that she had to block this and that so
they are not left exposed to criminals really
then she did it like that also her car at work where she parks is not a very good area and they have they have broken in to the car like three times
three times they have broken the glasses they have they have stolen her cds they have stolen the stereo
ok yes eh that is the bad thing about living in the city you have all kinds of attractions but also there is a lot of
disadvantages
i miss
exactly
goodnight cristina from idaho
you have to be careful with the kids
and they relax and all that
and
oh for example when this happened here it was major news here at least a man who came and and killed a family and took two children
yes and because precisely living here in the country and the children one never imagines that something like this is going to happen around here and
and
of course
and you have to be careful always
of course that's the way
yes but you realize that when you have children you start worrying about all these things ah it's terrible
of course when you don't have children at least you take care of yourself right but
like when you're twenty five years old no
yet having children and no
and li
yes how is colo how is where you live in is it a big city or do you live in the city or do you live outside
ah
aha
ah and it's a bit quieter
ah
hm mm
hm mm
i am well where are you from
really
oh and and would you like to move to move where would you like to what kind of place would you like live in
oh
it must be
wow
you have a headache right
what a difference man here is very peaceful
very very peaceful eh
is good idaho the state of idaho is very peaceful eh country i would say
i mean the city is much bigger is boyce
ah how many years do you have
that's why is a peaceful city and and is more or less a small city
and that's the biggest city after that i think it's idaho idaho falls but i think it's like a big town
because it's not a city it doesn't have any big buildings or things like that
so there are ones like this one which is a big town but
oh nothing happens here here people lives with open doors open cars
and
of course it's really quiet in the news they daily talk about someone missing something i mean nothing happens here
if something ever happens it would be like the news of
of course of the month no nothing absolutely nothing
sometimes it's just to quiet
oh
yes it's really quit and people a lot of them live in the countryside
eh yes
like i say it's too much too tranquil there is and there isn't much to do here the people that live here they like a lot of things outside like
camping fishing and going to the mountains to ski and
ofcourse well
of course
of course
of course
of course
of course
i spent ten years in
like a citylike a city city well
we i lived in when i lived in chile i lived for a while in santiago which is the capital
and of course it is it si different to live in a city i mean you don't leave open doors you don't you don't trust anybody generally and
of course
everything
if not everywhere but
of course no here it is really quiet to me eh for me it is too quiet but it is good because since i have children it is good to raise children and all that
because of that
of course
you have to be near
from chile
of course
yes
aha
of course not
a little more relaxed
of course
clearly
if and that's what i miss because here there is not much to do apart from the things you do outside there's no opera no uh places to
the mall is very tiny no places to visit or places ballet concerts and stuff there are no such things here
then one more city you know as i say a city that is in utah
i think yes the voice sounds familiar
and and if you like to do things like going to concerts or going to see you kno an opera theater or anything like that a show
no no you have to drive about four hours three hours to see something nothing much happens here the only thing is that the universities here have such chiquititos show i stuff but
that is missing from the city
that you can find that type of fun but at the same time it's
ah with peace of mind and all that ah i used to like that a lot when we lived in utah
ah in city it's like a city that has all you want
and it's quiet
sure
aha
sure
yes you have a little girl don't you
yes you see that i would like to be near something like that that would have more activities and things like that
hm mm
of course
of course
of course
of course
but i do not miss
oh the snow the ice and everything oh
oh that is one thing i do not miss at all
well yes well when is when is and the time where your daughter lives she lives close also right
oh yes yes i remember how is your daughter
oh
yeah
aha
oh they were not at home though
of course
oh such anger
that makes me angry
of course you have to
you have to be careful
of course here you relax and that is the problem because we need that comes you know on the other side and that you take care advantage of circumstances people trust too much
hello good afternoon
and well it's only the weather i'm telling you i do not get used to it and it puts me in a bad mood
i swear that i in the morning i turn the window and i i get angry again
ah i'm in the highrises aha
yes where
no no no no i lived before coming here i lived in in lived in singapore for two years and before that i was in mexico city all my life
yes
yes well yes i have gotten used to to the tropics
then it's tropic like that no not more then
yes i arrived and it was like today today what's going on
yes
this is maira
and in the air that it rains for a week i don't understand how they can survive this time
yes
yes yes yes and what happens is that the cold if you can put up with it like let's say until december christmas passes and then when what happens is that
when you come back you think yes well christmas is over so you then say the cold is now now over
the cold is for christmas and that's it and you come back and it is worse that is when it really hits me i stay like that like that like oh no
that's it that's it please
yes
oh come on seriously
oh come on aha
oh that is unbearable
memo are you memo
and i was thinking of going there that is good that i didn't go because i would not have survived i swear that i would not haev survived
uh huh
ah
ow poor guy
oh
ow poor guy
he asked for it
oh
in what year is your brother
ah ok
who are you
it's ok
of what of the crime
i haven't heard much here in philly i heard that some people got robbed in the forty one or whatever
but i think that i've had good luck because i've been walking alone in the night on the forty one and i like to go shopping
in the stores that sell fruits on the forty eight and i go there when i want and nothing has happened to me
yes alone enchanted about my life in addition i'm not even scared of anything
and nothing has ever happened to me i've had no reason to panic or get scared on the contrary everyone is very friendly when i go there
then i don't know i think that
i think i've had luck because in mexico it's the same all my friends in mexico has a history of robbing or kidnapping or something else that happened to them
and nothing has ever happened to me i'm always alone in the darkest hours of the night on bad places and everything people tell you not to do
oh again
all of that i have done at the same time and nothing has ever happened to me
yes yes it is like that i swear that that mm i see what i have done yes i remember what i have done and how did i dare
what was going on i sure was an irresponsible teenager bu well nothing has ever happened to me
so i don't know i don't i don't feels necessarily so insecure because i don't have many reasons but you you do know philly
oh yes how was it
aha
yes
yes too
yes yes there is a lot of it
ok
how are you
yes
yes in general like in philadelphia there are zones that i don't dare to go yet
i don't like it i mean in the night the center city there are some places that i dont like to walk
but i don't know maybe because i dont know very well the city or i dont know the people here
i mean in mexico if i see somebody i know if i go near to him or cross the street or not
and here is like that so i don't know i know whom i have afraid and who not
well no no no
yes
mm
yes also
very well how is everything how are your classes
listen so then you don't know anyone in philly that has a history of of that they've stolen anything from
mm okay
mm
yeah that too
of course apart from that its also not that rare for that too happen you may be walking and then
43 just like that they cant always do that
yeah its relaxed
not worry about anything
yeah there's not light
and no light
good
on the streets
uhum
yeah
me good everything is good i finished all my exams this is the week in which you can't do anything
hello good afternoon what
oh no
no but but where are you from where do you live
eh before coming here
ah before coming to to study here
ah ah then it is there
yes it's very hot or it's hotter than here
singapore is very hot right
yes
ah and then eh yes it's cold and
eh
ah maira what's going on it's jose
no it's cold and yes yes there's no sun ah yes i know after the summer it's nice but a a a week like that with a bit of cold and of
so that uhm ahm not much like that i like that but ahm yes one knows that it is only the beginning right of a terrible winter
then ah but that that is what strikes me the wrong way but
uhum
oh
yes i know type my my brother studies in in in cornell that is like much more to the north it must be around six hours from philadelphia but it is
much more to the north
and over there it is so cold that the classes don't even start until until the end of january until maybe the twentyeight of january or
yes yes because wehl he says that here it is so cold that for me we better stay more days in may that spend here the days in january really the students because it is that
they are is that the the cold in cornell is brutal the one in philadelphia at least one can take it right the one in cornell is is too much
hi um
and my brother
right no it's that and my brother uhm well he was lucky to to be given a what they call a town houses
but that that it was much bigger then one went in and they had a first living room downstairs and kitchen and then one went upstairs and there were all all their rooms but
it was quite big but the problem is that they were some of the new university dormitories
and they had built it on on the on a on the outskirts of of the university so it was at a really far end of the university and his lectures
they were of engineering that were on the other end of the university
and and he said that that and also he is oh it's that i say no right then i tell him but i say ha there's there's a bus system there of of
of public transportation there why don't you use it no it's that i don't want to pay the fifty dollars you understand
right so in the end he spent the whole semester walking and and in winter it was i don't know twenty degrees and h he walked forty minutes to get to class it's that
oh it's that my brother
it's jose
no no it's that it's
but it's because no no that yes it's that he's cheap right he didn't want to pay the fifty dollars then he said yes i it's that that's ridiculous then he said
no because the bus only goes by once every four times every hour so he doesn't want to wait fifteen minutes it's a thing like that
oh it's that my brother i don't know
no but um he's in third year now
yes yes but
and and what do you think about the crime here in filadelf
er of the crime yes
uhum
and you walk to the forty eight
yes again
oh
yes yes
uhum uhum
to the
ehm
mm well i don't to well to me
to me is is the them with me it is almost the same story right because nothing has never never happened here to me s but of course that i live
here close to the university i live in walnut and thirtyeighth between between between the thirtyeighth and the thirtyninth
thn it is not very far and here there is a lot of safety and then but in general i i don't know anybody either that that have done nothing to is that seriously i think that
of course if happens right in by turn you see it it in the newspaper and one
good and you
but in general it is pretty rare because in in these areas there is so much security ehm and they have cameras
and and lights and they have those phones and they have the people the the the police that ride a bike that it is incredible what they what they have to
and they spend a lot of money but also it i it is like in general they maintain it pre pretty safe
i imagine that the people of this neighborhood by example or the criminals know that there is so security that they have to be careful really
it seems to me that there are many times that it can do with the criminals so i don't know its pretty safe in general and now
in the quad they have of those because the security wasn't so strict before you had to pass and gave your card to another people
and then they passed what did they call the system that to see if you really were a student or were not
that you were not falsified the card and then you pass right but now
but another thing is that the people get out and was very easy to get in but now they have those sistems with new doors that
you cant do anything right then they worry very much for the university in general
oh well here i'm studying a little bit and then they called me and i say well why not why don't i rest a little right
heh
yes
no
yes
mmmm
yes yes
well philadelphia has many dangerous neighborhoods because
eh they have and the neighborhood is really safe right so then you have here the one of the university which in general is also very safe but
say it you go to the north like in north philly all that and south philly and west philly and well is not necessary but more
in other words only that gets very very dangerous so but also for example if you are going to go out at night you are not going to go out to north philly so then is not so
and how are you how are your classes
so important right
for us
yes because if if you are going to go out if you are going to philadelphia but that you go to old city but then in old city there are so many people that go there that they even have police there and everything
then
yes eh yes in general well also there are not that many students that go to old city usually the students are they stay here in the university
i think eh yes well generally but people complain too much that there's no security here that we are in a bad neighborhood and
but generally is is that yes every week you read the the d p so there is there is one time that
that there was an assault or whatever so then you naturally think that is that is happening a lot right but
in in reality is a you think well maybe they assault or rob i don't know two hundred students but there's like twenty thousand students so the probability that the
what what if it happens to one
uhum uhum
of course it exists right but its not so high
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah but that too i think its better to live like that like something from the high rises of the university specially if someone goes at night
its just that um yeah its nice too
too walk a long time people live in baltimore but the blocks are big their should be
yeah huge um
there's not light no light
yeah there's no light but highrises are better its calmed you don't have to buy every piece of furniture
eh if something happens you just call the university
but and and one has that that also there are many i have heard many stories of so of problems between people that that share an apartment
hi
i'm in the linguistics program
mhm mhm mhm
mhm
sure
no
but no
well the ldc what it does is collect all type of lagnostic data can be test like it testeh oeal thing then this may be used for many things like for example
ah programs that can understand voice needthey need a training do not need
a sample should we say
and then maybe mm for example for that you can do and and for studies from how people pronounce the letters to the dialoge how it develops do not know how don't know
for many things and the ldc they do they do that collect data in many languages and then people
you can use for practical things or more theoretical studies no
mhm yes yes
hi i'm olaya in philadelphia
well i live in west philly but well good not manywest lets say i live off forty three and spruce
no to much west
i see
mm
mm
well i really like them i mean before living here
they told me that philadelphia was dangerous and
take care of west philly even in some guides it's written that being at the campus at night is dangerous
and well this is my second year here and
and well i haven't saw anything i have never felt insecure in general i mean it might be because
are you spanish
i don't look around i don't check the local news i feel a little frighten
and i don't know nothing has happen to me and i don't feel threaten i don't think this is a dangerous place but i know people who are really scared of west philly and
yes but well mm
that is their that is their problem no i mean i don't know
mmh mmh
yes mmh mmh yes that
n i mean tell me tell me
mmh
mmh mmh
yes
oh ok ok very good nice to meet you and where are you calling from
mmh mmh mmh
no is it true that things happen i know a girl that got in trouble right
and but those kind of things happen in every city
and there are crimes in every city i don't know i think there is here
we think about it too much and people keep doing it and it goes on tv the newspaper so then the end they create a collective state
from psychosis right
yeah
mhm mhm
mhm and west philly doesn't have good zones but it does at the same time its good for traveling
and i don't know there's people that live in the center that would think nothing happens right
also ok
and and i know i think its a nice neighborhood actually to be honest
mhm
yes yes yes mm
yes
mm one time i took a walk to 70th st or something like that i started to walk and i left
i wanted to see what i would there and
well i found a normal neighborhood a poor neighborhood the neighborhood look ugly and the houses looked old
saw poverty in some places
i but i didn't see anything wrong i didn´t feel scared
well i feel that the profit of that neighborhood was worst than others
i'm studiying now
and of course it also surprised me that i didn´t see one bank on the street
are the things that have surprised me the most about philadelphia no the the big division that there still exist
yes mm
mm mm yes really and sometimes is interesting i mm i take the bus here here in front of my house and sometimes when i get on the bus everyone is black and the bus like starts changing color no as it moves
that you go east and when you go west the other way around is one thing
yes yes yes is interesting
of course of course is more related to the social class no more than a racial thing is clear yes
what part of mexico are you from
they say is dangerous no or that is
mm
in in upenn the college
yeah mhm b
mhm mhm mhm
mhm mhm
wow
aha aha aha
i had heard that too i mean kidnappings like that
yeah yeah yeah yeah
wow
mhm
mhm mhm
yeah what do you do
hmmm
and people didn't do it before no no they didn't report it because they were afraid
hmm
yes yes yes hmm
hmm hmm
hmm hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
wow mhm mhm
right
wow impresive
mhm mhm
mhm mhm and no
do not know how it is meforgive i say also i do not know how it is in mexico but also i believe that here television comes in osea
provokes no that there the same scares because the news are more local and very
going around every issue going around and they explain and explain again and
really
yes yes yes yes they look for mordibity and i do not know what
and
already
hi who am i speaking to
oh okay i mean do you have anything to do with this program
but yesyes
well yeah in mexico in mexico that is not as much not as much because it is it is osea so excesive that that llewhat
it's practically impossible to keep on showing every hold up or every
each well violation or each i don't know
each robbery you get me so it's only the ones that are exorbitantly large i mean when they are kidnappings
very drastic or when they are like the the the the the case of the the dead women in juarez that are that are
ah okay
and pa and p and with what end are you'll doing this program or what is it for
a
ah okay ah
okay okay
yea wow
yeah
more especialized
wow okay hear and this one where do you live here in philadelphia what neighborhoodo
olay i am arturo
ah okayah well yes is is no no too westhow you say
yes i live at the campus
but i live all the way up in the 40th
in the high rises
and how does things work there living in the 43th
yes
yes
really
mmm
yes also that
uh no i'm from mexico
yes people black people no like there are many people who are intimidated by black people here
e to me
yes of course no but it is that i mean like many people associa west philly with like well the barrio like the ghetto no like l l
black neighborhoods and like unsafe
but
i mean i i don't feel like so intimidated either or anything because i have a friend who lives around fortyfifth
and and i walk there very frequently and and at night aso and everything
and e and i run into a lot of people too there sometimes at night because i have to cross through through this through the park
and this and there are many people there are also this at night there that at two in the morning are there partying and well this
i have never been threatened or i mean they never ask me a cigarette or something like that and already
from philadelphia too in fact yes
no i mean in in truth no i don't see that they are provoking there like
ah okay
yeah everyone yeah yeah yeah
yeah ha
yeah yeah
yeah i think its like you said like its exaggerated so people do it by themselves
like him the idea that its very insecure but it actually isn't its not that insecure its just the ideas you make in your head
its getting worse then before actually
yeahyeah
what no
what do you do in philadelphia do you work or study
yeah its all the same thing for me
what this means this is not very nice or anything similar to it but it is as you said you have nice places to take a walk
well i am living as a university student i don´t want to be far away from here i want to be in touch with the people and the university
i also believe that
that's the reason why it is very comfortable for the ones that live in the university
really
and what did you find
ok
yes
yes you didn´t
uh okay
they do not make much money yes
yes yes yes
yes is that the displacement is incredible
yes is incredible to see that the more you go to the west there are more black people and there's less whites
yes yes yes
yes yes yes is true i've ridden the bus just one time but i do remember also getting on it and then then i noticed that
everyone was black when i was going towards the west
yes but that's also a result of that the majority of the the the black people here are of lower income therefore
of course yes more than anything is simply just that but
from the city mexico city
oh me too
yes yes yes there is much more serious that matter not as much as here that that here is really serious
and specially there's still a lot of separation between the social classes and is very obvious is
i am from a i have like a an appearance much more eh european let's say i am i am blond i have white skin and light eyes
if i go walking through a neighborhood over there in mexico a bit unsafe
you better believe it that i'm not getting out of there with my wallet
nor i mean but i i of an hour i mean no they will take no time in catching me
and they may even kidnap me i mean it's much more likely that they would kidnap me
yes it's impressive right now it's it's interesting because kidnappings who who they kidnap i mean it's not because you belong to a certain family
prominent nothing whomever they get you into a car they take you away and they call it express kidnapping then they they take you away and they get what they can from you i mean form a few
thousands of dollars up to if you have much more well whatever you have but what you have i mean not more people are
yes chemistry engineering as an undergraduate
like very desperate then well they do stupid things really and it's
it's terrible but well this but well to tell you the truth i mean lately also there have been much more social conscience about what th the th citizens this now they're really starting let's say to oppose it you get me then
people report the uhm the muggings people are now opposing to them
i mean there's been a lot uhmm a lot more participation because before it was like no one
yes because yes no and because really the security system was practically useless i mean you reported a crime and
it was just a paperwork procedure that that didn't go anywhere
but then lately they've been let's say reaffirming the action of the police and things like that and trying to
to catch more thieves and kidnappers and a lot more so that way then people feel there's a little more response to to all those
to those reports
before not so much but even then and also for example there was a march in mexico a couple years ago
and you
almost a year and a half ago and it was called hmm a silent march for mexico's security and everybody went to walk to the
to the city's main square
and millions of people went to the march it was packed
or is they would see all the world dressed in white and the wold world on the streets
then ah like you noticed that yes osea is is is the truth something socially needed osea the people are there
a lot more attention to secureity
any other thing
yes
yesyes yes yes
yes very yelloish we say no
aha it's javier
and i could do a description of you and
it would be good
and have you had a problem with the going to court or that
yes
and it can yes it could happen too but i don't know but they say that that i mean it is optional if you if they sent you a letter
eh is it optional if you want or have to go i don't know exactly
aha
oh
sure it is
oh yes it's like a a friend also received a letter like that but he works from six in the morning to four in the afternoon then he didn't he said that he
eh the company manager said that he was someone who couldn't couldn't be absent
exactly
well yes yes but i don't know i mean sometimes i think it would be good because most specially in cases of
hi how are you eh like eh i think that this is good i have never taken part in like a jury but but i would like some day i don't know about you
girls and boys rapes
if you can serve as a juryand and and if what's like if you realize that the person i mean the person is guilty and
you can help to make justice faster i think is a good idea
ah
today yeller
oh ok ok no i would not resist not because it's ugly or horrible that
you ah where did they send you i mean what state
oh you are living in canada oh
i'm here in new york
yes but but what i was telling you is about my friend in arizona because i was living in arizona and
ah yes
and then but there in canada eh the system is the same eh you thin
oh look at you um oh it's good it's good then
you never know when you would come but as you said we need to be careful right
unclear
i imagine that they do a meeting or a session to explain the case
you are already inside and you have to decide
oh already
no too late
what was your real name
petty oh sessy or jessy
ah no eh you know that sometimes they say that it's a bit difficult because more than anything else compromising
oh besy oh
javier yes yes yes
oh you who are living in canada then how much time
fifteen years wow
how can you resist the cold
yea
yes
yes
oh
oh
because maybe afterwards you have if there's some trouble i don't know like there is your i think that they have they have like your record or your data in court it's safer i don't know
oh yea in what state is that province or state
oh vancounver it is not from washington state
ok oh yes and you know l was planning traveling to vancuver because some friends from bolivia were there
but i lost their track and i could't get there because they told me that life over there is really quiet i do not know if that's true
oh
ok yes yes
ah
ok i see
oh and where are you from originally
oh i thought that i am from ecuador
aha
yes because i can hear a little bit of salvadorian accent that's nice and well l want to go there someday
like the justice topic sometimes here the things are not very well
and the the how
yes tell me
yes
here in the united states
sure they put you in the gas chamber you know
ok
oh yea yes yes yes
ok
yes yes
sure she is going to have a very hard time you can imagine ok a serial killer who killed someone
and right away what to the gas chamber no well they have to punish them yes or no of some years
yeah right that's it
mhm
yes but no
sure it's they'll get him there
what he did i don't know why why ah why do people do that no
yeah but well as i tell you not even
people are crazy
and as i tell you here it's it's getting difficult every time you hear comments that that in canada things are quieter
a well a drug dealer or something
yes
oh the i don't know medicare something like that
yeah
yeah exactly
and over there
is much more fair then
how great
listen and and how is working opportunities there
what type any kind um construction
yeah
oh i see i see you're right no because he can say she is like that and
oh
yes yes
oh no why
because i heard that you can that this country canada needs a lot of people right
oh yeah well there's a program on the internet that if one get points like sixty four points and one
can go work and the government will help them with everything
yes
yes that's right
yes that means you can
im interested in doing that right
alex ah besy
aha and th they may have friends bah let's say you say ok he's guilty and then he could have friends and say ah this one go after this person and kill her children or her
yeah
i see
me no
aha i see
mhm
aha
no well the letter that was sent to me um i said no but i sent a letter from my doctor
saying that i couldn't be seated for a long period of time because because i have an illness that i can't be seated for a long time or walk for a long time or stand for a long time
so they said it was ok that i did not have to serve as jury
and that was last year
it was ok and i guess he asked for a letter
to send to the jury to so he
oh hi
mhm
ok for that yes but but good i would like it at all
because i'm not i'm not a yeller and ok
no if something happens ah rape of kids and the i don't know the show a video of something eh
oh no it's ugly yes
ah no i live in canada
yes aha and you
oh aha
aha um oh
more or less i think i don't know
ah no they sent me a letter last year
already
already we need to be careful it depends but no one tells you what to do maybe only the judge knows
or where does it have to be
but that is when you told you were going to do it
alredy be the jury
and if you said no i don't want to do it it´s too late
he already said yes
besy besy already
no besy with a b
already ok ansd yours javier
but for already for serving as a jury i said that i ah that i rather not
yes mine is difficult
fifteen years already
yea yea
ah well i lived in a city before where the winter was very cold and had enough snow
enough snow fell
and then my husband and y decided to move to the beach
in o in another province
and then here the winter here is just like the rain nothing more
and it does not get cold
aha it is a province the british columbia it is close to where i live in vancouver if you have not gone to the city
mhm
ok ok more or less ok yes ok
ok yes
oh ok i spoke to someone before and he told me that you should be living in a paradise and i asked him why you say dad
because there are many islands everywhere and the sea is really close and you could go to the united states
well having a passport
he can go alone cross the border
10 minutes from here to the border
yes from washington
from el salvador
ok yes
i don't know i say that serve as a jury is something ah dangerous because well it depends on the case that you will serve as a jury in
ok yes
ok
oh sorry
no mmm well how do you call it one who kill somebody and will receive the death penalty
is it happening in some state there
the death penalty ok
ok but i was watching the news the other day about a woman who killed her three children
she put them in the water and drowned them
then my mother told me they should kill her and i said it is better to put her in jail that way she is going to suffer more
if the other prisoners know what she did
or that one if it's a a
i say they will shatter her in pieces i say
yeah sure something to make them suffer because if they only kill them and
he suffered mm what ten minutes or whatever and he was but but if they get him in jail ah the other inmates mm
poor guy
that's it people really suffer there i say
mhm there you go he's going to pay for what he did yeah
yeah
who knows crazy people
mhm
yeah here it's a bit quieter yes
a case of someone that killed someone or or if someone from the ah of the a that sells drugs from the
because i imagine that the health care of of the united states is not is so good or or is like the the the eh how do you call it
what do you call that that mm a card the card that you are given for health i do not know what you call it
yeah me medicare yeah that one
is not not that good
oh really
umh here is mm i say that is good because
is much more fair since here is more fair than the
then there
yeah well they are looking for many people to work in construction
i am sure um i think is to make building something like that
what do you call it from the
yeah and they request from other towns
well if one has it if one has experience of making buildings or making houses things like that
i imagine that you could ask for a visa or something i don't know
ha
at least in the state where i'm at um i heard news yesterday that they were they needed people for
for construction work
where here
oh really i didn't know that
mm
mhm
hello hello hello hello
uh blacks and hispanics they want to know that
eh we all have one
yeah so it's like but it bothers me that something as simple as you know you are puerto rican i'm dominican
no no no i know but
yeah but what kills me is that we're so close in proximity
dominicans republicans santo domingo are what like ninety miles apart we're closer than florida and cuba
and we hate each other just because of where we were born what is that
exacty yeah but i you know
hm mm
it just it makes me laugh i usually don't tell people until i'm asked but i never deny my race like people say something and i ll stand and be like oh hold up
hm mm
hm mm
get out of here
oh thank you so much i speak spanish like a white person too
oh l let me find out ok that's another eh that's another thing that bothers me just because a person is um you what what does it mean to some white
you know what i'm saying what
hm mm
no abs please i'll tell everybody i don't care
hmm mm
yeah
no it's no it's not your fault it's not
your fault is not to is you know people act ignorant around me all the time and say stupid things like that and it's like
oy yes cri they always criticize they criticize if if you marry
yes if you are je and you marry a hispanic cla
i i am uh my father is dominican
i and eh both parents
yes ah well yes my my husband is puerto rican
so ah that was also a problem
with his family sure his doesn't like dominican people much
so nevertheless when one looks around that doesn't have anything to do with race because even my husband says it if we went into the detail
hello yes no it's okay uh what's your name where are you from
things of a family if it was a family situation
my family there are more professionals in my family we are more educated uh
unfortunately in ergonomic stuff we are more stable economically however
the only reason they had for not liking me was that the last girlfriend he had before me was puerto rican
and i am from dominican parents born here raised here
right
g
right
right
yeah uh i can't understand the ignorance of
ok my name is jennifer from new york
yeah i have a my brother's wife is uh africanamerican she's you know
come again
uh uh manhattan
oh ok so yeah so um the topic for me uh i don't understand it hav having been uh raised here in in new york um
i understand it and for me there is no such great thing always when two people are happy
uh no i care little that they're green and yellow uh pst
hm mm
oh ok uh ok and and the funny thing is that we're not all the same
because there are dominican persons in my own family that i don't like
i don't like
ok so let's begin so that we can finish quickly
yea
hm mm
yes hm mm
yes but
but eh exactly to deny i mean i love to talk to people about my professional life i talk to all types of persons what i means is that
i'm talking to you where are you from i'm dominican
what from where how is that possible i was thinking that you were what does it have to do with anything
hm mm
aha
aha
ok so uh the subject was uh uh interracial marriages
eh
hm mm
but that's
he is your friend but that is ignorance because
you know
yes
is that no
exactly
that is doesn't have that is i'm sorry but that is ignorance
yeah that is ehm
oh yeah that's it that's today's subject so what do you think about interracial marriages
and you still still been know that it doesn't have anything to do with that
that's it that does not change anything because still
aha
hm mm
there are from all kinds in all of the the races
yes no yes because that is true with dominicans that they like to multiply
to have children
yeah
yeah
ehm but you know that
hm mm
ehm yeah i feel like speaking english uhm i can't we can't
but all that is because the brother is a police officer here in manhattan
in the twentythree and i see house uhm and he uhm and i work with uhm in inves uhm like an investigator but i work mainly with police officers
so in that
so a moment yeah so that's what i always say always oh where are you from after talking with me for a while i've helped it they've said things uh of dominicans in front of me
they've said oh yeah yes so blah blah blah blah they say  oh where are you from uh dominican
eh oh
yes right
oh yeah no
ahá ahá
i see well i
aha
yeah because
you can but the the diference is that you can critique a person and and describe like that dominican stopped there on the corner
ok but yea
yeah exactly aha
they know each other because pitifully the worst dominicans that do all that stuff they are marked they have a tattoo
they have a shirt are
yes
oh yeah eh yeah yeah that too but we aren't all like that is that is the funny thing because when i was at the university that was like where are you from
new york oh oh what what how what what ethnicity are you oh i'm dominican oh no
yes i i was also asked that what do we think of uh if it is easier for certain races to marry for example for white or chinese people
i don't think so
yeah oh no that one that one is unfortunately that's a a trait we all have but but still it's the whole point of
excuse me the point that um because we are and have that attribute
no doesn't want to say that we are all equal
because i have cousins that i'm embarrassed of because they are sluts basically
and no no but no no i understand but you know let's you go to the heart of it
eh they are like that and i also have people
your know we are professionals we do what we do and unfortunately ok so my grandmother had a nice behind and everybody inherited it
but
no
hello i'm sorry
i think it's not easier but it's more like no not better because as a latin person to marry another latin person not yes right now it depends on where you live where you live if you get married if i'm latin and i marry a brunette or something
and that's all starts like even in chatrooms in the computers checking out the chatrooms
and that's just like crazy the way that we're fighting
yeah well the reason why i part asked you why you're from new york'cause
like what part of new york'cause you sound like like white
yeah you sound like white
but no nothing of course not now let the spanish come out
yea like
like me when i told you i'm from the bronx i thought you were going to hang up because i had three callers i told them i'm from the bronx and they hang up
they hang up on me
in in florida disneyworld
in many places maybe many people will criticize
it was a line and we were standing a few excuse me'cause you had the line was moving but they weren't moving
and i had i said bronx new york and they oh honey come on they're from the bronx and they moved and they got off the line like
out embarrassed
i was like oh oh well
yea
we are yes
yes but all the races what race are you
aha and your mother
both parents are dominican well i am puerto rican
yes
with his
yes
yes
john from new york
yes
yes i
right no i am i uh i have dominican family
i have a lot of cousins that married dominican ladies
and uh they they have left them
divorced and everything and they don't keep in touch and still when the girls see them every time we're like  that's my cousin and they have they have lived with us and everything
and they have always been raised as uh they're my family we comply i have a lot of dominican friends
i have black relatives too my cousins have married africanamerican males uh
yeah wh where in new york are you
where in new york
and you oh
oh i am in the bronx
yeah that's why i think also i think
yeah
yeah i me too i have gone out with gu go girls of different ethnicities
they're um i don't know i don't i don't care the first girlfriend of mine was dominican
yes
yea yea same as same as me i have some friends that they are dominicans
but n they say that they're dominicans but they don't tell many people that they're dominicans because they treat them badly
because that that they're gay and all that and he says i have and they don't have because it the same family of theirs say that they're gays
like like they tell him that they're rude all of those things and they're
yes what was the topic did you hear it
they are um nasty
they are ashamed of themselves i said this has got to make them feel ashamed because this happens to all races
yeah i know a guy ok
no i know a guy he's a cop a real cop
and i he always he has tattoos um of the puerto rico flag
and so i thought he was from puerto rico but two or three weeks ago we did had a barbeque no more than three weeks ago to say goodbye to the summer
and he was there his wife was talking and something happened and he said bag words to the flag i don't do that and he told me that he was swearing to the flag because he is not dominican he's this and he did
his like how when he became a citizen here
and he said he was from puerto rico but that he had changed his documents so that he could be from puerto rico
well that he was born here but he changed absolutely everything that his parents and everything all of that
oh ok cause i didn't hear it mine
yeah i said but and why did you do it then he said because those people have not ta don't talk to me he does not
does not want to know about anything dominican i say but i that is not like that because right now there are puerto ricans that don't want to have anything to do with puerto ricans but
for life they say oh i am puerto rican
never sa they never change i don't know why you should change it
and he well no i am i am american puerto rican american and with that you don't do that
oh me being dominican hey i am dominican because that i can not change
not like him that has been paying and paying to change absolutely everything to get that he is a puertori and do and and from new new york
hm mm
yeah where where where i am working now
en the bronx here there are many dominicans there are are there are many boricuas but there are dominicans too
to me it doesn't bother me after all you just fall in love with a person
how many people talk ho dominicans are stupid they don't know how to do anything there's a lot there's a lot of dominicans
ehm you say there are more dominicans than whites
ye
yeah no and then the the the puerto ricans do not say anything because the more like they say the more hispanics more latinos the better
the whities are the ones that there are too many dominicans and this and this and this
thes puerto ricans want to get oh absolutely everything here
like that
i know so i am getting up i as well
yeah yeah
yes
yes you can marry whoever you want
yes
yeah i've uh i i talk about dominicans like that too
but in front of them and also of puerto ricans in front of them
talking is something talking but some of them talk about them and they fall deep until u until they get the point
because i i sometimes we're we're a group talking and i say look it's dominican how dirty that and that but i'm on a group with
two or three dominicans two or three puerto ricans
with whiteys that's that's how we chat
but
yeah because when i see people on the street that i know that i see they're dominicans they have a flag or something they're dominicans
i hey dominican come here
no to me i don't think i worry about it nobody should worry about that
like that
yes like the
yes like the women too
you can see them from far for something
si yeah
yeah yeah turn around
yeah
yeah
yeah oh no no i didn't mean it that way i meant it with the back part
yeah
i don't
yeah
well yeah but you know it's like that always it's like
that that they are you know like like sluts like you said
puerto ricans
dominicans hell yeah
like look at me my family with their own cousins and everything
i know that for a fact
yeah
yeah
yeah it's not even it's because like some like the dominicans say oh dominicans think they're better than us and puerto ricans thing they're better than us like that
yes hello
uhm yes
oh but they still call you or not
oh and they only pay her for twenty five right
yes do it in english right

yeah one no no no think but when one is in school that is where all the friendships are you don't have to to to ah you know communicate with your friends
no the whole world is right there in the very center you know
but already when one leaves and has to be at home and has to pay the the the expenses of the house it is very difficult it is better to stay in a school
yeah forcibly yeah
no no no
oh yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
of course yeah
eh yeah
yeah well that's not happens
yes the call was dropped right
no no your habilities
in the life when you finish school the world calms down you know they get families or get married you know
you know they get childs anywhere and the life gets easier not
yeah that's why if you want to live the americans live you know the american dream
the american dream you know buy her own house etc
right
yeah
yeah
right yeah
yeah you are more more responsibility in life
ah i don't know why
but you know but and then the poor people life is more more easy
the life of poor has nothing to do you know if you want to work you work if you don't want to work they support you
you know
yeah more or less same thing you now
that is why you need a good woman one that can help you that she has house an apartment that helps you for this or that
no but that's life yeah no you know
live and learn
right
right no but e
you tell me the the big companies are g are giving you things
so how have you been
don't you see that the the r big companies give give you cars no money down they give you the the things
yes
hello
there are lots of people that i don't know that that they have so many calls that they haven't processed yet so i think they don't know how many calls
each person has so i don't know what they are going to do there are lots of people now my mo she has reached twenty five calls
but she knows there were several calls that didn't drop then she doesn't know what to do right
yes they still call her i don't know two weeks ago yesterday they called her i think they still call her but i don't know
i think yes i think yes but hum at the end i think they are not very organized and that surprises me because
it's something they already done that the the ldc they done that 2 years ago or one and a half years ago
but that was before that was in english but they did it in arabic and and spanish and whatever but that is an old story they have done it several times then i do not know at least once
and then were several months so i do not know why suddenly is something new
no
i know no no and it was not only the recorder i think they had some kind of computer or something else
hello good night
and what i said it was my theory but they write a text in english with the things they want you to say
what you hear right
then they went to the autothis translator then they pur there the text
from english to spanish and then there from from there they copied to a computer that that that did i don't know that then there are computers or programs that one
put put a text and then the computer the computer reads it
yes yes no no well well the translator it was something like that a kind i imagine
then the thing that was speaking
i imagine that was it it was a computer
then no no not only had a very bad accent but everything it was saying was for examle when the calls ended it said
your time if for above
fine who am i talking to
yes no no no i don't me neither well i i i did not even look until until many times really what i heard what what what i don't understand anything right
and then once there i heard ah yes your time is for above or for example once co/ was was that they had am the the topic was dating
then
the the translation in spanish was to put in the calendar then like that do you like to put in the calendar things like that that are
ay incredible but and and they obviously have people who speak spanish right ay i don't know like that i no
it has not been good very very very well organized
mmh mm yes shudong yes but the good thing is that they pay well in the end one is a little bit sometimes it is a little annoying like that to have to answer and
but no it is not so bad there and they pay well
mmh
mmh
ah david this is joe jo jose
mm mmh
ah a surprise
yes in philadelphia yes yes well well my mom lives outside i live here eh in west philly in
at the university then
i'm here i'm here mm
no no university of pennsylvania yes no no yes is different yes everyone gets confused with that because there is well penn state
is in the middle of the state
and is is a public university
and so the university where i'm at is university of pennsylvania
yes exactly yes that's private and is in the city is completely different the other one is is much bigger is public is in the country
ah fine fine where do you live
ah
i don't know since i've never gone there i i don't know exactly where it is
but i do know is in the middle perhaps in the eighty one perhaps one possibly but but even though the eight one i think goes more towards
no possibly yes possibly yes because i know that the eighty one goes to i don't know is better if i don't say anything i
yes all i know about the eighty one is that because we used to live in tennessee before
and northeast
and then there around virginia we lived in virginia then we passed to tennessee but i spent eightyone there that is all i know so
it seems that it is the road is long i don't know i don't know but yes e but then you but you end up you are studying or what or whatever you do
mm ah okay
much easier i imagine
ah yes yes yes how are you
yes yes yes yes
yes it is good for the the good thing about beinn in the university is that is a place that already when one finishes already one's expenses go up
enough really so it is and buyinng a car and and and you want this you want the other so one already must begin to work really to to maintain as long as you are a student one lives there
in short i don't know i don't know if you know of roman noodle soup
no no no these soups that are sold by by raman that cost yes twentyfive cents
yes one lives on roman noodle soup twentyfive cents the twentyfive cent meal one then it is so
you spend a lot less but its a life more quiet yeah is quiet but also i think that when the people remember when they were students they forget everything all the work they had passed its not true
yes yes but it's also a life with more freedom more flexibility in the time like for example tonight i want to hangout
all the nights i wake up and then i don't know studying i don't care cause i don't have class tomorrow true because i don't have or have class but if one day i don't want to go i don't go true
but in the work you can't say ahh yes i don't want go to work today
yes i don't know why
only if no no it's not like that like very flexible
mmm
a lot harder
yes yes yes the problem is that i feel that you have to be happy with the things you have and that's the thing
the people don't do cause your incomes gets higher obviously and with the work you get more responsabilities true
but at the same time
all that we consume is one one get better car and one maybe and do another and that is it and when we come and see we had spend all the money right and we just say it appears to me with all the responsabilitys right
then don't know don't know i am happy like a student for now right but eventually one must save buy a house but
don't know that scares me to have many set bills right because we only work and work work
and we feel that we are not enjoying the money right but also in part we say well we do not think about the benefits right but also
ah yes i don't know what they are going to do with that because they have
one has a car to go to work right then we have that need to have then you need to cut the herbs don't know i believe is too much
too much like set bills is responsibility set that is
yes definitely
yes no
yes yes is that
it contains the wife
yes
yes yes
yes
yes no yeah n eh i think that that there are there are that's why that that one has to have like that i think care with with
so many calls that that have dropped and a couple yes i think
how you spend money because it's easy because for example if if one buys something then buys another and buys another i you have nothing and one feels that one doesn't won't enjoy the money right
one has to seriously look into
what is more important right what what what is it that you like to do
and if not it's not that then better not to spend money on that right
that's what i think
