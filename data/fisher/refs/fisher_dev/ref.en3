yes
aha
yes yes
yes
yes hmm
oh and where are you from
hmm yes yes let me tell you something
over there in barranquilla in colombia from where i'm from
there's the same little problem too
but it turns out that am at home the church we go to
eh well we talk and everything and we reached the conclusion
that in that respect women are pretty no and they need to do themselves up because they are not going to be like that all the time
exactly so in that respect
yes there are there are people that are very bothered then they look at the other person as less than the others
and they look at you like in a strange way but i don't pay attention to it because and more my my sisters i have two sisters
and they dress very nicely and they're young and one has to dress nicely
oh i see
so no yeah but there are people that get really bothered
sometimes they don't say hi to you
or but no but yes they have their own way of thinking and sometimes they are really stubborn
like this  because no that's not the way it is it is the way is say it is
but well you have to
yes
right
right
right
yes
i am from colombia yes
yesyes
yes
clearly and one should go beautiful because if if someone fixes them self up to go to a party it's true that
that has nothing to do with god or anything of that ah when someone goes to church they have to go very well put together
being fixed
exact
exactly yes
yes
yes
what things and
uh yes it´s about religion
i was going to tell him you eh were you born in puerto rico
um um
yes wow and the
aha you got married here
ah wow yes
oh you are young my mother is twent eh
she is going to turn fifty in november
yes and ah i'm turning twenty seven years old
in november al yes yes then those are the things that one thinks when you come for example to the united states
like trying to find a like a better future for for all our children no
afternoon
yeah
aha aha
aha aha aha yes yes yes yes
hmm
aha
oh that is good that is good
aha
aha aha aha but no in in our countries it is not the same as here
over there there is a lot of poverty and there is no work
and over here not here you can find a job anywhere
but but the family when since my family stayed over there in puerto rico my mom is over there my brothers
carmen
my nephews and and every now and then i go to see them
but but i am not going to live over there in puerto rico because my two children are over here
although they are all grown up already they are still living with me
until they get married and everyone have a profession and their their and they go and live with their wives and husbands
eh no can't i can't go there to puerto rico calm down
in puerto rico yes yes
ah
no vi i came to live i went to florida with my mom and my little brothers
and from florida i came here to chicago with my mom and my little brothers too
my mom went to puerto rico after
its the first time we talk no
and my little brothers went to puerto rico then i stayed here and as i got married i stayed here
but my mom was coming and going but my mom disliked being here due the cold
why not and she says that that what is worth that i stay in here between these four walls in puerto rico she can get out of the house
it's not the same
in puerto rico yep yep
but my mother is catholic and my aunt too
and but how am my uncle is christian he goes and reads from the bible to my mother and and
and he talks about father god and then asks my mother questions about father god and my mother responds
but he doesn't like that my mother am after my grandpa died my mother has has pulled her eyebrows my mother has
done things am holes in her ears to put some earrings
ok
shaved her legs she was wearing pants suits too
and my grandmother and father don't like that
because he says that women should not wear pants
for in your religion
of my mom
he says that women should not wear pants because the pants are made ​​for men
but my uncle is very uh as it is labored to religion
he has religion like chest as the
so if that does not tell their children they get to religion
only it is my mom sisters their nieces nephews but the kids do not say anything
in chicago
so am so ah i tell you that that to believe in god must be seven days a week at church
but this seven days a week at church
he is here on on saturday he says he goes to church since early in the morning
until night time and on sunday the whole day at church
so then he is very church fanatic
i have a friend she is christian and she only she says she goes to church
saturday and sundays
but mu uncle goes seven days a week
and and he is always talking about our heavenly father that our heavenly father here our heavenly father there
and i always when i go to puerto rico i tell him
twentynine years
heavenly father we have him with us twentyfour hours a day
uh uh i tell him you do not have to go to talk to our heavenly father because in your own bed you can talk to heavenly father
the only thing is that you can't be asking daddy god and nothing else what is it don't think about god when you have problems but all the time
because some people
ay god please give me this ay god please give me that but when they're fine with no problems
then they don't remember daddy god exists
ok and you
ok
ok

ok good afternoon
ahhhh
but aha it continues
well i think well i am catholic
and i believe in god very much but i don't i don't practice the that of going to the to the to the church every day every day every day
because i was taught since i was little my dad
us would put us would make us kneel in around the bd
and over there all of us ahm my dad my mom and all my sibling and my siblings
we would ask god for us for the whole family
and my dad always taught us that that for you to be believe in god you don't have to be inside in a church
oh but i have an uncle that is christian
well thank god and you
but he is he is in puerto rico
but every time i go to puerto rico he wants one to change religion from catholic to theirs because he says that catholic
is one ah is a religion that that ah how is it that you can i mean women can can go with pants with panels they can cut their hair
paint themselves
so he says that isn't good
that that eh on eh that catholics are so liberal unlike christians that put their their
i mean the wife puts her suit or her skirt and blouse
long skirt and and not cut and not panel and not painted
then hum but my mess is with religion
and and don't you believe that that that
yes it´s very cold
that the same god that the same god that he's adorating is the same one we're adorating as well
aha
aha
aha
aha
aha
aha aha naturally aha aha aha aha
aha
aha aha aha aha
aha
i´m from puerto rico
aha aha aha
right right
yes
right
right
but also on catholic school too i remember when my children were little
for i took them to church
and we were waiting for the first the first to come out the first one to go was for the american people
we were waiting and behind me there was an hispanic lady
she was talking about the lady that was coming out if that lady thought she was going to a party that her suit was too
and you
too colorful for the church that her shoes were too high that she had a lot of make up that she seemed like a
like she was going to a party that she wasn't properly dressed for church
and i looked at her and i told her
how will she be talking if she adores god
yes yes
yes yes yes yes yes
and you should not talk about your neighbor if you are going to church
i suppose you do not talk about your neighbor
but she was and i looked and her and said wow my god she is talking like that how can this be
if you see a women in the street showing almost all her body
oh do you know today´s topic
ah
yes
yes i was born in puerto rico and raised in puerto rico
and came to the united states when i was eighteen nineteen years old aha
y got married here and
yes and i have a twenty eight years old daughter and i have a twenty six years old son
and i'm almost fifty years old
yes
oh yes
oh that's almost the age of my s of my son
hello milgred from connecticut
adventists or are um of the evangelicals
or they are of the of the other ones of the taballas the ones that sell uh oh what do you call them the th i forgot their name
but it's i mean they're a lot of a lot a lot we're a lot of races and we're many religions
but um i don't other religions don't bother me i share with any religion as long as they don't try to to get me into something i don't want you understand
yeah that aren't fanatics right
yeah
yeah religion is like politics
depending on on what side you look at it from well not everyone is going to agree you understand
uh um yeah but that's good it's good to to discuss everything because really if you realize also my my i have aunts and cousins that belong to the evangelic religion
and the rest of them are mostly catholics
how are you good evening
and in the uh on the other side of the family there are also some absentees
but when we get together no one is talking about religion no one is talking about you know that  you should be like this and  you have to change nothing
and my cousin's husband is evangelical he almost always attends is in the church and she does not belong to the church and they have a really happy marriage
and she she doesn't she only attends when there are special occasions for example when the mothers celebrate a ceremony to the moms when they have in in
in which they more celebrate because they do not celebrate christmas but they do other there other occasions that
the evangelicals
okay yes the evangelicals so my cousin's husband i say is and was not evangelical they get married in that religion and after they get married he joined the church and she did not
and she dances and she drinks and she never stops and he goes along with her to the work parties and everything and he is there with her and does not
i mean he is not doing to the people ah you should stop smoking you should stop drinking should there is not any moment
yes they do jokes in the parties so relaxed she does not get grumpy either not anything you know of of that thing of this thing nothing that you shouldn't say that thing not really happy
hm
yes i mean is the kind of people to whom everything depends on who who who how how the person found him but if they get obsessive never mind
that is
okay
okay so in that way he is right like my cousin is
oh yes
yes
yes
so you don't go at church or similar
no
i go to church but i not that of a nun
do you believe that it unites disunites or
i don't like it
yes
yes
i think it is a strong foundation specially for children
well yes you raise them at least with with something forget it that they go and and are i don't know they they get a little wild kind
they don't have like feeling or rather they do not develop a feeling towards anything
i understand like they do not care about anything
and and and you you said you were christian and that and what a miracle that uh you were accepted by his family seeing that the jewish almost always
they are how do you say are
only among them they try they try to marry and so they can have the same religion
or do you think that if the whole world was of the same religion we'd be better or we would be the same or it would be
yeah ah
but did you get married as a jewish or did you married as a catholic
oh how beautiful oh yes yeah
hm mm
and that said aha
the girl and the great one are baptized catholics but the small ones although not baptized in the catholic church also visit the church
evangelical churches
she goes with the husband of my cousin and she puts on her long skirt and they respect it
it's religion to them and eh she is happy to go with them and i never said no when they asked me if i can take her i said ah yes
you know
a much better world
because i believe in the bible it states that trousers is something for a man
it is related to
that is for those who become fanatics
they interpret and understand word for word what is written
as the iraqis with their crazy doctrine that kills people in the name of
of that god they have or of the or whatever they believe in
that is that sometimes there are people that like they give it too much thought it it is distorted
interpreting what in truth must be something that should unite because religion should unite it don't matter which one it is it doesn't matter which one it is understand i don't think that because a person a religion and another of another then
have to to kill each other for that for that for that belief
so for me like i am not not fanatic of anything i i never become fanatic with anything i observe i was raised in the catholic religion
aha aha
and i helped in the church and belonged to the to the club of the daughters of mary and i helped a lot in the church and all those are
always has been my my faith the the catholicism but no just ehm the it did like i would take my children to the church and i baptized them because it that is how i was raised
but as adults well if they want to go wherever they feel like it i they go understand it is not like they have to that i have to tell them no you can not visit that other church
or you can not believe in that because catholicism says that that it is different you know
and the majority of this of this some people that are in the gospel or in the jehova witnesses and they even try to get things in through your eyes and they want to come to your house to to early in the morning to come and sell every thing they can think of
and i well sometimes they knock and i tell them well look thank you i already have the little book and if not i tell them well look i am catholic and no
are reckless
aha ah
i had a lady who used to come look each time i went out the door the woman came with no look that you an help us with that buy the book you know that
that you are fishing and what do i know but it is that i have been a sinner since i was born my daughter so there the lord can reprimand me when she arrives i there well
yeah yes i think that is it's the same and like we wouldn't we are not of the same race so the each race has its
eh if they try to i don't know they tray to tell you such negative things instead of telling you well look you can know more about the lord and what do i know or something else
on the other hand but that you are a sinner yes yes yes i continue sinning and now you are sinning talking like that
its doctrine their own oh and and even if we're hispanic some acquire other that in eh sometimes are not not even i mean sometimes some of us are from a catholic family and the other members of the family are
hello
uh um
exactly that don't get you
or force you that you don't feel forced yes
that they talk to you but i mean that if i believe in the what is uh what's it called um the that religions fall apart because of the same differences
well what you believe in the differences always exist
exactly
uh um that's why they say you should never argue about religion not because not because of i can't believe they have made us discuss religion on this program
uh um
uh um
uh um
mercedes speaking from philadelphia
who are them
okay
hm
what happened in my house is
that eh my mom is evangelical
and my dad doesn't um he really didn't go to the church he never decided
and but we everyone of us went to the catholic high school
yes it's like we never always had christians but
we had you know what we learned from school at home we didn't reinforce those concepts
and now i think that from my sister only the older one is still catholic the youngest i think is evangelic and i have decided myself to be without any religion at all
mm good evening too
no
no
so since i finished college i decided i would never go to a
to a church i really don t fell interesting an organized religion
no exactly i don't like it and i don't really need the necessity to do so i feel a have god in my heart
yes that's how i try to live my life but let's say that know that i'm married my husband is jewish my son is also a jewish and we'll raise him like one
because i think people needs to grow with a religion
yes definitively i
hm mm
hm mm yes
let's see what we talk about religion then
yes yes for this reason i agree with that yes yes is that if children well that's why they say
yes yes they are really like that
yes you were lucky
yes yes it's true yes oh they of course of course they are very strict right
but no my husband's family have always been very understanding in fact their other son married a girl that was also not
jewish and i think i imagine that maybe that is why i was the second one it did not
no we had a religion a jewish wedding
yes and lest say and then is what i say my son will be raise and say is important that he grows up in a religion
when he is an adult he will decide what to do
the truth is if he wants to follow or notreligion in itself is another thing to raise a child on
hm
hmmmm
i don t understand when my mom says she has to wear skirt when going to church
then i said because it is wrong to wear trousers
yes but for me that was one of them
not moving away from the truth but a little bit from organized religion and that the people takes the bible too strict
ah yes
hmmm
hm mm
hm mm
yes
mm i think that i what i think is that that the
hm mm
ah but is that there are people that well i understand them in that they
their job is conve no their job but they wish that people would convert to their religion right but they don't respect either he no
right or or that maybe on well there are peo
someone being of the same religion that we are all of the same religion it's impossible because i think that there will always be differences eh cultural
and that's going to make that every person interprets the that one religion their own way what do you think
hm mm
good evening how are you with norma from here in atlanta georgia and were are you
my husband is american yes yeah
and then what do you think about religion or religions
aha
mhm
mhm
mhm
mhm
right in fact i am a religious person i belong with a religion called hare krishna i don't know if you heard about
mhm it's based in a hindu philosophy
then every one of us believes that we are part of god and we believe in reincarnation we have laws and rules we're vegetarians we don't eat food eggs and fish either
oh okay
mm we don't drink alcoholic beverages
because we believe that every living entity deserves respect to avoid violence against the other living entities
that's why we don't eat meat or get intoxicated with drugs or alcohol
we don't take coffee or tea
and we don't play games of luck
no are you religious do you belong to any religion
mhm
mhm
oh but you do believe in god
oh that's very good i mean there are many times that you can identify with a group of people no
i am from peru
but its important that you have god in your heart and you treat to develop a relationship with god that's very important
mmm a supreme being
sure
mmm yes
mmm
sure a supreme being that control everything that happen
sure and the religion really i mean the religion or believes that you have in that supreme being join people because in the moment of dessasters suffering then you always
turn around and always you ask god for help everybody in the world there are many people even they called atheas themselves on the moment that they are despair always
they don't ask they turn their faces like that to ask god for help
no that is really one is the one that is really in their heart no one feels that there really exists a supreme being only that many times don't
oh okay yes there are many people from peru here
hmm sure hmm
yes ye that is why not in the philosophy that we follow there is always a ___ there is one one verse that says no that when one is suffering
one must always one must always seek help from god and that one should really ehm should should ask god to send you suffering because in that way one remembers him more
because otherwise when one is find on forgets about one's relationship with god
in t in that it is true no because when one is doing fine one is very happy
no then one thinks that one is the one that controls things not that one is the one that does the he is the one that controls all of the things that happen and of one so that is what does the deeds no
no but really that is what is that god blesses one and helps you in many circumstances
and and you have one have a notion regarding reincarnation or something like that regarding the law of karma have you heard anything have you read
hmm
if the law of karma is a law of action and reaction that one is rewarded accordingly positive or negative activities do not also have a positive or negative reaction
ah are you mexican
many things people say do not happen although they are seen as good people they are not really
past lives that had negative actions are not having negative reactions and suffering
not that there are no innocent people or no people who are very good only a reaction has free will
you can not do what you want god does not force you to believe in him or obligate you to serve or perform devotional service
no one uses free will and does negative activities there is often a reaction to the law of karma if is infallible that no one is free from the law of karma
mhm that is what we think and not what we believe
in our religion yes
yes that is i am now married and live here in an apartment near the temple
the temple here in georgia in atlanta but before i lived in the temple or was admitted there i lived not doing service to krishna but to god
no there are different kinds of service that one can do preaching singing the holy names of the lord cooking for the lord as an offering to god
oh okay
and it makes different activities no
not everything i mean you do your the center of your life is god no and you offer him everything you do all your actions all that you cook all that you do and the moment that you get up you go to the altar and we
we offer food to the lord then this is good now and i am married and i have children then i have to worry about them
ok but if i always go to church no and i have there devoted we get together most sundays or for big celebrations that we have throughout the year
mm
well we have bhaktivedanta prabhupada ace bhaktivedanta prabhupada he is god's devout who brought this knowledge here to the west
no and he is who we really no or we honor and
well we respect jesus christ very much also it is not that we don't respect other religions other beliefs
of course and but he brought the knowledge here to the west about the consciousness of krishna like we call it the name of the city
mm
mhm
mm
it calls international society for the krishna consciousness
ah his name is ace bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada
yes he was born in india
well he is no longer on the planet no he died when he abandoned his body
no i mean he is very devout he is considered a pure devout of god then he is there turned to the spiritual world
no no he has not reincarnated because the goal of life in this world in this material world is for one to develop his devotion to god
and that you go back to the spiritual world and the spiritual world no longer comes to this material world despite this cycle of being born illness and death that all living entities go through
no even animals and human beings
no
no i am i take care of my children i am homemaker
nn aha
yes he is already at that level he is now a pure devout
no it is very interesting it would be good if you are not interested you can
peru no no my husband is
hi
yeah form peru american
oh right ah good
then i think it comes from medival times and that
the religion was lost during institutionalization what i mean by that is that religion wasn't left to be something spiritual
and converted into something more political and lately in our times isn't such a political force but it giving headaches too
like institutions then you can be religious and spiritual
but not necessarily institutionalized then you may not necessarily favor what church says or favors
a certain institution like the jew catholic or the muslim but then perhaps like someone said you can mix a little of the philosophies like
using them to take a good road in like more than anything
what do you think
i am arturo i am in i am in pennsylvania philadelphia
ah yes yes i heard something i don't recall very well and don't know what hare krishna was about
aha
and why don't you eat meat why do you believe that
oh i see
aha
yes
any kind of games of luck
no i don't belong to any institution right now i was born and grown up as a catholic but right now i am twentyone years old
since i was eighteen i haven't followed the indtitution because i i was not very interested in what they preached
i felt rather like my spirituality my contact with
yes nice to meet you where you from norma
with this god didn't need to be through this institution so i just decided to read a bit about other religions but merely
to cultivate myself and to let's say get the right way through life but
i am not a i don't like institutions
yes definetly but no
exactly
yes precisely you have tu reconize the true of that
a divinity behind everything no
but i mean in base of that i had changed a lot and studied too i studied chemistry engineering a lot of time as people of sciencie you tend to
we say broken the people religion or corrupt it
but i think all the contrary because the people begins to know of him so i am very scientific this things are very religious because
from peru my my my roommate is from peru
because they give realize that with that more you know and can explain
more questions you get and more you discover of this inexplicable world and there are miracle things in every place every time and this
i am sorry each time the people knows more like scientifics and that people understand more must be a divine caos a divinity behind everything
yes
yes yes yes yes that is
yes exactly one does not need to turn to religion to seek help but also to say thanks
i think that many times people then becomes religious on certain moments because they need help but when they already that they are fine that is forgotten by them
yes
yes
yes you then don't remember
for lima yes also mexicans
yes yes yes
yes yes yes true
well i have heard about karma no and like ehm like how karms is is is carried out no that is if you had a bad karma you are going to reincarnate in another being but to
to improve not to clean not to have another opportunity to have good karma but not something so pure
ah ok
yes
yes
yes
ah i see the hare krishna
what have you done do you meet with the hare krisna weekly or daily
yes i am mexican
aha
oh yes
aha
of course
ah ok and do you have a prophet or something like jesus christ how is it
aha
what is his name
yes of course
ah ok
and what is that man's name or
from the city of mexico
what is his name
ah ok ok but what's the name of the man who brought here
ok is he from india where is coming from
ah ok
ah ok but then i mean he it is very possible that he has reincarnated in someone else o he doesn't reincarnate because he has karma
ah ok then he no longer reincarnates
aha
yes exactly
ok of course
and then then he already went to that level and no longer reincarnates
very good and in georgia what do you do study or work
ok
ah very interesting
and you guys how long have you been in that religion

haaaaa
no
ah
aha you won that you put as i receipt them from msn i have msn
then josefina was awarded with this she obtained press here you have a free scholarship and have i don't know
and a trip uhh and the cruises and
and i erased them because those are for knowing
if you answers to them they don't stop
mmm
ah
and i say how do they find out so much of us don't they
two days two three days aha
people so weird
wow
mhm mhm
to finance the costs right
oh but that is
yeah but it is horrihorrible because i leave this a little controlled with the filter they put me a spam filter
i lost it i didn't buy it but they put it in my msn
i think that filters a little but not always the junk where it says junk there are about ten or twelve a day right
right
so
oh my god
um
right
oh
or it has to have like an annex or an attachment something like that that says
if you want you can open this email something like that you know
right mine has i mean i have had because when i send over yahoo because i have a mail a division
in yahoo and sometimes when i'm going to send an email it asks me to identify something that's like ciphered you have to decipher it right
they say this is for protection
messages like that
then they put the pieces the letters like you see them
not usually
but at times it is a a j
the and a number or something like that
you've seen it right its more like a puzzle right
i don't know if its that what
to protect
oh yeah
ohhh
that doesn't get filtered
oh and since its in between you've thought about the forums of univison or telemundo right
and when you write a word like a retard or an idiot it doesn't read right like it says it doesnt permit it
of course and one week you told me that you had an exam like on friday or something like that
mm a little of each one
hello good night ah this is josé
a math class that i am taking and i also have um eh i am taking a marketing class and also there i have another another homework then
ah in a week if you have a busy week but at least i have
this two days off yes
ah i still not i i many night i am busy and and can not then
only me maybe i have only twelve thirteen yes
ahh yes that is why i want to hurry because i know that soon
people will soon stop doing it
ahhh
m
ahh
ah good good and you ah good here quiet no classes tomorrow then tomorrow and tuesday
ahhh if everybody in the world
know someone in the university or they study in the university because
otherwise i don't know how one will know about this
okay yes sure sure
yes yes it's ok
no but i think that program has had several problems with the computer that or i don't know the devices that call
that record because it happened to me once or twice that i was in the middle of the conversation and suddenly the call was dropped
hmmm yes shudong yes
yes
yes those
yes then i came back home yes fall break
yes shudong
yes shudong says just hang up on them but i feel embarrassed i don't know
ohh
mhm mhm
ah
yes
but is she american
mmm
oh and not necessarily spanish
yes yes yes
holidays then yes here then resting
no never never i have two accounts i have two accounts in hotmail and one in
the university and the university never sends me anything
thus unsolicited emails but in hotmail is terrible all days receipt them
twenty twenty five messages and all garbage but
mmm
ah
eh yes
yes
yes the sad thing is that they do because the people that send all those mails they have they put and create programs
that go through internet from a website to another website then when they find
yes no yes then yes also i don't have class on friday
an email addres
put them in a list and then if
yes yes so also they go to the news group and also in
to everything so it's very easy that for instance the directories for example the directory of hotmail i imagine there too as well
they look for names and look so they make a huge list
and so with that list they make their message right and so they send it to everyone in the list but so the quantity of work that is required is little is very little right
and if two three people respond of thousands of people they won enough money for what it is
yes yes that is sad is that
with two three idiots they bother everyone right
mhm
then well well i have a class on friday but not
mm
yes it happens all the time i have read an article that looked pretty interesting that microsoft wants to do that they are making a software
hum every time that one sends a message the computer has to do something i don't know it breaks a code or do a tasks so its not
very very big
but that requires a little bit of work right so if you're only sending emails you write an email and you don't even know if you sent it right
and then when then when the computer does that job then it breaks a code then that's exactly what microsoft does uh it gives the email a certificate that the email
that the person took a little time to make right so if you're only sending two mails it doesn't matter then the mail arrives and it knows it's not spam but if you're sending millions of emails
you don't have the computer's processing power is not strong enough to do that much work right
sending so many emails so it takes longer and possibly what it expects is that it will take so long that i think it will be too
slow and they won't be able to send all the emails they send nowadays
it is not more more if it's nothing in general i am not going because it is more than that there is a graduate student who helps him but really the class
and the moment you get an email without that certificate you know that it's spam and you can throw it out
yes yes i don't know exactly
i don't know exactly what it is but i think it's an idea
right
um
yes
yes yes
uhhuh
hmm
and the numbers yeah
ah it is during the week where there is a professor but that is more if you need help right
yeah i've seen it yes mhm mm
yes i don't know i dont know
but it seems like the filters aren't that reliable right because one thinks that every time someone says something like that then yeah it has a
a a like how do you say it its like saying something you suspect you can throw it into the spam folder but sometimes
the people that create the spam know that the frases are suspicious so the frases in general activate
so then they create that form message right
don't let him touch the filter that way yeah yeah cause then
ahh yeah once in a while
oh that's interesting
then yes yes on friday i have an exam then i was studying and then i have yes i have several things this week friday i also have homework to
hello how are you
what do i think about the not requested mail well is a problem
throw it to the trash immediately
when it gets
to me make nerves
yes
mmm well about the email is a scandal about of spam
which do you use yahoo
oh gmail yes
mmm
mmm
very well i'm miguel angel and i am in philadelphia and you
yes i have it and its true i have yahoo too and also about the spam it put it in other folder
and if you don't want to read it no you don't have to read if you don't want to
mm no if that isn't the truth
ah no no
yes yes yes
mm not only in spanish you see i've been living in spain uhhuh up until last year i've only spent a year here you know in the united states
so in spain it's the same in other words there is a lot of spam there and i don't believe it matters what language it's already international
bad things quickly reach everywhere eh
ah i have bought i've bought things on the internet i mean i've bought books from amazon and i've bought concert tickets and things like that but it's always been on my own initiative you know
ah so if i want to buy a book or i want to buy some cd or i want to buy a concert ticket or movie or whatever
are you in new york mm where are you from from argentina don't tell me
but it's simply that i wanted to you know it's never because it was sent to me in spam and i have not ordered or bought as a direct result i don't read it you know i delete it
so no and when i receive something unsolicited by mail or something like that same thing i throw it out right away you know i don't even look at it
and at times man it's also true that sometimes i read it but no usually it doesn't interest me how about you have you ever bought anything
mm
hmm
right right
also most of those things are i mean they sell you stuff of that later later they don't send it they keep the money
they send you a product of very low quality i mean they sell you this things they aren't they are you they're really because they sell no well we sell you this look that and then maybe sometime
i've met people who has bought it and said well this is shit this is something that breaks after two days or
or it breaks or you know that then they aren't things of quality because if you said
ay i'm sorry because you had the  cho you know you have the  chor accent i thought this is argentinian
if you said well this this is great this that this those no but all that of spam that's all that's all shitty
it's a like it's like the yes eh yes it's like the li that sell of of and all those catalogues that are of
of super absurd things like that like one thing to scratch your back and that's one and have you seen those catalogues that of silly th of silly things of sillies
have you seen that i mean super silly stuff
yes that for example one
and have you seen that that goes it's like some boots that have a plug to heat your feet have you seen that
yes and things like that no that they sell it to you like that the lady shows up like that lord with the feet put in put in that little boot who
it heats up and it heats up the feet i sometimes think of buying that my mother
sure
mhm
ah ok ok
yes
yes
ah no no the ones that call you on the phone yes i tell them right away no
i am sorry i am sorry i am not interested and that's it i hang up
yes
yeah man you don't know whats been happening as well it makes me kind off sad people work in that its not that its dont laugh but its true
it makes me makes me sad that that people have to work and make money while calling then treating people like men and when i'm not interested i say im not and just hang up
but i try to be a little polite cause you know people are working to live by being phone call operators its not funny to them as well
that people talk to them in a rude way and insult them and then hang up the phone on them with out picking up
i don't know when i was younger i was a student and that seemed well i'm still a student but when i was younger
what did what's your name
well man in summer i worked as a phone operator it wasn't selling products i didn't sell i
i would receive calls i didn't make the calls
and i was working for a provider in spain and i was working for a security company
and the time was like like they call it here an assistant
and the people that called were the ones that got stuck so we got a call from someone and sent them a toe truck to get their car
and then wow i mean i worked eight works a day and their comes a time in which you are tired of it you get tired of people calling you with their problems
and well people insulting you saying the actually want help or just miss treating you when you don't have the fault about anything cause i'm the last one to consult
i was the little one in the company and i didn't know you know when a company is good or bad they paid me for
answering calls and giving them service that's why it makes me sad for the people that call
because that people that does not call you do not have the intention to give you a hard time people that call you do not have the intention to bother you the people that call you want to eat like you and like me you know
atri
and want to have a job then
i don't know i feel a bit bad that is i understand that that if that no that it doesn't that not for feeling bad i am going to buy a product that they are selling me that that would top it all
but you know but at least to treat them well and tell them look well i a not interested that's it you know because people like they say here do not have much attitude here in the united states
it is one it is one of the things that i note i note the cultural difference no and what in spain we call to be to be a  son of a bitch
yes that to me i don't know that is no you know sometimes one has to be a  son of a bitch because people are driving you a little crazy no to their face but
when here is not need to be a  son of a bitch well there isn't a reason to you know
i see
sure sure
yes yes
listen and tell odri what is a peruvians girl with an argentinian accent doing in new york
ah oh oh odri like odri
aha
aha
um
ah of clourse
ah that's why
um
ah of course
nice nice very nice
aodri hello how are you
yes
no oh yes
to me when i open my email i see it many when i see that i say oh this because sometimes it tells me
five nine messages and i had been written i see that are five new ones and four
it was directly to the trash
no but the good thing is that by example the service that i use for email
how is it name no i use gmail
yes they can assign
i don't know how they do it but they have a way to verify that is spam and put them in other folder
so i work in that i am going to tell you works fine ninety percent of the time
my name is aodri and i am in new york
yes
yes mm i believe
i believe that the majority of the technical services for mail have this now because it's like an invasion and they try whatever way to put
words as if it were a conversation and it's not just in english because i'm going to say that
i also receive a lot in spanish eh
my personal mail and my work mail and i receive a lot a lot a lot
so then you've never bought anything from spam
no i no but i remember that almost a year ago i read a magazine article about a man that
as that he loves buying stuff stupid things
he lives on that and i stop it seems to me i've never meet someone who
no i am peruvian
who has bought from spam but because everyone get get this fury when they see that blessed spam that this that that and i
yes
yes it's it's disgusting
yes yes no yes you you know what that
maybe there's a reason to have it but it's something that to spend the money because uh
yes yes
no but you know what i always say i say someone has to be buying this for them to send them as they send them
and and they have la laws that in the state of virginia it's illegal
to send spam an unsolicited email
but all the same many arrive a lot of them arrive
you are not the first to say that don't worry
that's also like for example the ones that dial on the phone ouch ouch that really i that really gets me mad when i see
yes
no no no no i'm not so kind with them no no no i ask them what they are doing with my name take my name away immediately
so there's a thing i don't know if it's federal but in the state yes our governor did it and it's of a cover
and that you can you can enter your name and if someone calls you they have to to pay a fine because it says that no calls should be made
yes i have it my boss my exboss what he used to do when they called him from from one of those cards to raffle a house what do i know
eh from mortgage he used to tell them wait a minute and he left them there waiting because he said look when i have to speak to a costumer service for whatever for the credit card the bank what do i know
they always place me on hold for a long time so i love to tell them
wait i leave it there and he would love doing that
oh
but tell me
yeah
yes
oh okay okay
yes
yes
yes
you are right it is not always like that but i will not i will not lie to say that no i always am there no and i don't want to ah
because it is the same thing especially when they call on my cell phone i say oh
in the middle of the day or sometimes at work i don't know and look i have a lot of things to do
its not for you to be bothering me
odri
well eh you know is is is a kind of long story but first i well i eh i was born here from peruvians parents but they also went
then your parents were young
none of my parents have peruvians accent not even my grandmother neither my grandfather had
eh my grandfather lived in argentina for a decade and
he was eh very attached to the argentinian culture and all that
yes and my mother has some of the accent
and then i also have it i have it stronger and also i work for and argentinian studio
then i get their accent yes yes so but no no no no it's not is a legal studio
aodri
yes yes exactly exactly
well what do you think about the mail not requested
hello good day
music on that was her throwing a play to the floor because we are trying to
sorry
but you know we spend the whole day listening to music
classical or you know playing whatever and we listen to it in english and spanish
so when his father is at home we only speak in english
but when he leaves for work we only speak in spanish
so but what about you
aha
aha
hm mm hm mm
my name is anny and i am calling from miami
hm mm hm mm
hmm
yes
aha
hmm
yes
hmmm we
right like we had an
not a good moment but mi daughter like two months ago started to sleep by herself when night came alone
bu when she had seven eight years we took her from our bed
hello
to her cradle and i couldn't you know i had a lot of trouble making her sleep and finally i discovered that if i eh put her some music with a sound machine
you know that she sleeps well y now we bought her an ipod
because what i do is i have you know a month and like a hundred or so cds
so i can choose what i want her to hear normally when we put her to sleep
we choose you know the lullabies i think they're called
so i put on the music i turn on the machine the sound machine
well we read her some books and already she knows that when she hears that she begins to sleep she sleeps better i put her to sleep in the crib and like in 5 minutes she is already
sleeping yes and that for that reason well it was one of the reasons that we bought the ipod
because also when we are in the car she wants her songs and whatever and in order for one to carry 500 or so cd and have them in the car
and but she also is a good she's not sometimes she makes a model of a baby
okay
so we bought her the ipod with the money that she
herself you know
that she herself worked
yes yes
we did it well partly her and partly me because i have my music there also so you know
yes so
well probably ninety percent is hers
and you know because like that if we are somewhere whatever because the car is hers too
it has like a headphone
if not with that and and when we bought it i thought that she was going to put you know a walkman or something and now i'm doing it
hmm mm i'm coming out
yes me too
hm mm
yes yes i understood you don't worry yes
yes
no but look we are going to have the ehm our next baby
god willing within one week
and y know that is what we are doing we are going to go to a to a maternity center that is here and that is what we are going to do
because you know for me the first was a csection and
no and it was not because i wanted it it was supposedly because it was an emergency
but i think that okay
yes it doesn't matter
that okay so
you know we are going to do that with her she is not allowed to watch television
you know lots of times when we go to church and they speak about the elmo dolls
or whatever she just makes funny faces like she's thinking  what's that  yes people look at me like saying  doesn't she know who elmo is and i go well we don't watch television
aha
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
music
well and also you know i like we're going to have the baby i was thinking that we were going to put it
not to watch television but for i was looking at what programs i could let her watch that were educational but
yes but i i still couldn't
yes but
what happens to me is that that i know that on television i'm not going to have any problem eh in getting her interested
and that i prefer if i can until she's at least three or four years old
that she continues with her love of books and music and all that i mean you know that we continue with that i don't know
yes when the ba the baby arrives that that i'm going to fell that that in order for me to put to have a bit more tiem you know
the most i'll do if i do it it's going to be half an hour a day and it's going to be a program that what do i know
you know educational
ah music eh we passed the entire day listening to music i have a 23 month old daughter
but als
well the the biggest difficulty that we have is that w we don't watch too much television
but and if you go into ou to our house you think that we watch a lot of television with because our house eh has a
came with those televisions of fifty two inches
so also last christmas we bought a tivo
then we taped we taped the you know those old movies and or series we were interested on but
but it is nothing we never watch abc nbc nothing of those
always is the discovery channel or what you know that kind of things the history channel
but that's why because i don't want that she watches tv to me my husband he is watching less tv
because when he is at home and she is awake don't you know not turn on it
and no i don't let her see the tv but i always have
so that that was one of the difficulties that we still have a little bit that he he is like you know he understands that i don't want that she watches tv
but he does not understand that he is watching tv she is watching
right
hello
uh hmm
oh yes
oh okay okay
is like is like allowing her
yeah that one that is the problem that i have with mine i say because also i don't watch tv i am all the time in the bedroom
oh okay
no it's okay don't worry
hm mm
uh okay
hm mm
oh yes okay i understand
oh well i uh normal i i oh listen to all kinds of music
no i don't have a favorite i like listening to anything even foreign music
um and yes i spend the whole day listening to different types of music because like they say music calms down
good day my name is jenny and i am calling from new york
even the most ferocious animals i think it is so so now i work at home
and i work in the court so then i'm not in the court discussing something i'm in the house and in those moments you feel more agitated
ah it's the best moment to put the radio and listen something that calms you and leaves you relaxed in the
in the way of thinking like it should um still no i don't have kids but um i lasted a few yours working in a pre care
and that was the best when you wanted that
a class of of eighteen kids of only four years
you put some kind of music ah classical
and like it changes the whole mod of the room because if it affects the human animal sense like they say
so hmm
oh okay
ah okay hello
hmm
hm mm hm mm
okay
hm mm
hm mm
already
hm mm
wow so already she has a routine
hm mm
ah yes it's better to carry an ipod that
can you hold on for a moment the phone is ringing on the other line and i will return immediately
hm mm
oh
aha
so is more or less with her laziness you did it
ah good that is a good idea
well yes is not just going to be her music only
oh oh that's not how things are
oh wow
hm mm
yes
okay
no that's the best that's the best because i tell you from the point of view of a person that was an educator
the music that li the the children that the parents let them to them they cultivate in them the love for music it is rather uhm to teach them to read
because it helps with the concentration with uhm the movements if if one observes children some time when piano music is is heard
with their little fingers they do as if they were playing a piano all of that helps
for the uhm development i forgot i forgot how to say development in spanish
well the development there it goes the development for the child to __ for the past so it is doing a marvelous thing because i always thought about that i tell my husband very often when we have children
there are several things that you are going to think that are a little bit of crazy i was telling him that i want
you know that i want to give birth in a bathroom with water with music and he was like aha you are kind of crazy
hm mm
oh wow
hello
hm mm yeah
uu
oh okay oops sorry it is the dog sh sh quiet
i'm sorry
aha
that's better yeah
hm mm
no that's better the best way to make sure that she is a successful child you have to keep that that's the problem i have with my husband
i tell him his mother was a bit weird because she would let him watch television all the time
i don't know i had a television until i had thirteen years old my mom and dad hadn't bought one we had nothing like that he thinks it's weird
pardon ah which was the the theme of this call
that i was so advanced in school i was way ahead in the education system i finished the university early he has waited for me everything that i've done i've done it quickly
and easily and he i always tell him that it's because i wasn't distracted i had no tv to steal one or two hours from me
take me away from my studies i was always focused and my mom and dad we were poor but if one of us wanted to play music my dad and mom would do whatever they could so that we could get music lessons
you know we were interested in animals we would go to the museum
on the weekends or you know we always had education so you grow up faster i mean when you become a teenager
when you grow up you see the difference and your friends know about this they know about this
and you feel weird but afterwards when you are much much more mature now i look back and i say thanks i tell my mom dad always tha thanks a lot because now
i can buy that house that i want if i want an ipod i buy it i have one
if i want uh a playstation we have it here all it does is collect dust
because we don't play with it i don't have interest and my husband says that you're not going to sit down to play i don't want to play with it either
ah okay good begin yes yes you want to start
so that's that but also i see the benefit of not have spent my youth
hm mm
well today there's not many programs
according to there are there are a lot uh they have uh on channel thirteen they have about 2 that still survive two that have the approval of the educational system here
in new york
hm mm
hm mm
no
hm mm yeah
well i i have confid i don't know you but i trust that you'll do a wonderful job because the way i hear you talking
oh okay
it's all that i in my mind saw and said ok this is what i want to do this is what i want to watch and when i speak with my husband he ah
i don't know any longer i don't know but
but it's it i'm listening to you and i realized that it is good you know everything you're saying is perfect no there's nothing
that i would do differently as they say
hm mm
oh my goodness ok
ok
hm mm hm mm
oh yes that is the best
yeah right
hi
uh huh is he already at home or still in the hospital
so
mhm
yes and no that is the problem yes
of course
yes
hello
no no no i'm here
ah how nice
mhm now wake up every every two hours
uh huh
mhm
mhm
mhm ah well so you don't even have to wake up
mhm
i spoke with um jenny
and i also spoke with your brother but i forgot the name
hi my name is zola from texas
because yes he started to do it to do the study too because ah jenny stopped participating
yes the i mean that's what he told me when i spoke because look i spoke two two times with a lady from new york
and she was talking but very little spanish very she spoke spanish very badly
so i sent an email to the person in charge of the study and i asked what would happen if i oh i had to talk to someone who didn't speak spanish well
and he told me to hang up fast to hang up the call because he wasn't going to count that call
so he sent an email to everybody saying that if you spoke to someone who didn't speak englishe spanish well
eh not to talk to that person
yes
so it seems that oh your brother told me that jenny read that message and so she decided not to participate anymore
oh aha
hi manuel
no no i told your brother to tell him that that i was the one that sent that email and that that i hadn't sent it because of her i had sent it because of that other person that didn't speak any spanish she only knew very little words in spa
mm
because i think that speaks spanish very well call
mmm
aha

mmm
ah
well and you
mmm
eh ah as has already married to your brother because it sounded like your brother's kids are big now

mhm
because i can't remember what we were supposed to talk about but your brother was telling me that em no i was asking him if if he had had any problems living there in nebraska
since there are almost no hispanics and he told me that in the neighborhood where he lives there are no there are no hispanics he is the only hispanic
and i asked him if he had had problems with people looking at him askance or speaking to him and he told me no that he only had problems once with

hmm

hmm
right it happens
and you what music do you listen
texan yeah um
um
um
uh

i see there was no problem
um um
no un oh well and what about the regular music in spanish
that from any country i don't know like
yeah
colombian
you like cumbia
yeah
oh ok
yeah
of course yes its good to listen to music in the car yes it entertains you and if you're traveling alone in the car its good to listen to music
oh that's good that's good
im one of those peope that listens to music all the time and i have friends that also listen to it all the time now people have those mp3's
where they can have eighty one hundred or two hundred songs they always have it in their ears listening to music
yes a don't like it i do once in a while yeah yeah to relax me or in the car or if i'm going to exercise i also like to listen to music
ok
hey
yes i like to wake up with music then my alarm clock it´s just the radio
the heart kills you
i like the music that the radio plays because that way i wake up slowly and relax
ok
when i got to houston i used to go dancing a lot
i see
yes i found a group of people when i went to school and we used to go out a lot now i don´t have the time to go out anymore
but after i don't it's almost like i got tired of going out because i had already gone to all of the same places and you see the same people and
the places were always full of people when i used to go dancing you coudn´t even dance because the people could easily step on your feet that´s is why i don´t go out anymore
additionally one has to pay to much to get into the places

yes i noticed that they are not so i think that where there is a town where there aren't much hispanics more so that there is nothing
and you know in where there are many hispanics there are many ehm the bad friendships start and all of that the bad people
so the americans start looking at that badly already no to to him
that is to a hispanic they start seeing that all of them are the same they think
and since over there there aren't don't don't have
yes they don't think this is a mexican this one is not going to do that it's not going to do the other thing
no n i think they have not they have not experienced mush with many mexicans
and m by the same there aren't there is not there must not be mexicans since there is nobody to do bad things
you see that the mexicans have a party one or two am a nd the music at a very high volume and like that
and there's nothing like that there until now now there's later there will be more hispanics coming
i'm already a father again
yeah
texan
i like it a lot i lived for long uh i lived in texas for a long time i like a lot the one they call like texmex
all that music

yes there are people who can not sleep like my brother who lives in nebraska
it was only about five minutes ago that i had my baby in my arms
there was a time when he couln´t go to sleep because he had no music playing
i used to tell him turn off the radio can´t you go to sleep without musiche said i waked up happy and i go to sleep happy

i went one time and yes i liked it yes its beautiful
what happens is is you can't walk
like they are they bring groups good groups from mexico all the people what to listen to them
if the hall can hold four thousand people that's just how many get in and no from there it was the only time i went and i never liked to go there anymore
good night
no yes
what was doesn't say i don't know
ah yes
and after the twenty something one doesn't call anymore right
ah that's good
okay i better get with it and get to calling then
of course
ah okay and everyday is different
ah five days straight
ah
sure
i am there right
sure
ah
i heard the music as well but ahm i also listen but ablot there was a long time where i stopped listening to music and started to listen
problems conversation programs
of politics
but is like that one of because of a lot of time
and after one notices that our music or i mean the music really changes your mood
why for the rest of the day no
so today i started to listen to music so i can have better mood more energy
because i do not know could be latina blood i guess
and you are from from ah where did you say you were from
but one needs
needs that you kow that that the music for dance the music for that
yes because here i do not listen much music like that style
really
no i like everything now
before when i was in chile i did not like salsa or merengue nothing like that now that i am here i love them
now the only thing i need to lear it to dance nothing else i love it
no here they have nothing nothing latin no merengue nothing nothing here
no because there are very few latins here
the majority here are like only mexicans
puerto rico
but on tv on the radio there is nothing spanish nothing latino
on tv no nothing
no nothing
like this because we are in the middle of nowhere
yes it's boring
boring when i went to california to visit it was
and how long have you been here
oh long time
i have been living for ten years this year
not much yet but it seems like a long time right
it's starting to get cold but no not so much like chicago
right
cristina i am chilean and i am here in idaho
oh yes i have heard that it's terrible terrible
mi brother in law lives in chicago also
oh i really don't know but he is attending the university of chicago
i think he lives near that place at the university residencies
so i don't know where
yes music
and what kind of music well being from puerto rico what kind of music do you like
bachatawhat is bacahta
ok
oh i see
how are you
yes i've herd something like that
and of and of so living in chicago it has been difficult to continue listening to what you did in puerto rico right
because many
because no there is much there is much varie or rather there is much much variety there is in chicago
so that's why you do not miss that too much right
that's great
of course
of course
yea
oh yes yes yes
are you there in chicago no
oh that's great
ah what
ahm serious
yes here in idaho nobody comes pue
no
what good times
aha
and so you don't feel to far from where one comes eh yes
it is all of that
yes here in idaho no here there is nothing here the only music that there is it's music like mexican like
oh
i don't know what its called but its something like'salty' i'm not sure what it is
but its the kind of music that i've never heard of before not even in chile
and of course in chile one listens to music like bolero and
things like that but of course over here its like whatever because no one listens to it and nobody comes here anyways so nobody has someone to
true
none of that and now i'm listening to the radio by satellite
and with that i've don't it i've remembered many songs in spanish because after ten years i'll listen to songs that play like
regueton and all that stuff
i didn't have an idea of that because i haven't listened to spanish in about ten years
and its spanish music
and what time is over there
mm that's good
yeah
of course
of course
yes is goo is good to have music in spanish becuase
because english is good but is not the same
because is not like you have grown up with nothing like that uhm
yes now i am happy with with being able to listen to music in spanish again because it is really different
in the mood and all that
to put yourself to see
what time is it around there
of course
aha
sure
and it would be more cheerful no
instead of getting mad well waiting so long at least one can dance in the meantime no
yes
really
really
my
twice with this one
uhh late

and my sister lives in atlanta in giorgia
and i spoke with her she is the one that the recording of for this program when you hear the girl talking ssaying what to do and all of that
she she is my sister
so when she dib the recording she told me to call so we could listen the and speak with her i was the only time that i spoke because i didn't talk any more after that since
it is nine here

aha
is that is scary no
ah yes
ah
of course
ah look
no i like the topic of music it's simpler the other time when it was a topic of immigration i think it was
that one is like scarier to talk about politics and migrations because
good night

oh yes i also talked about that
uh huh
of about politics i don't like but i spoke about immigration about music i spoke about marriage
about cellulars well a bunch imagine i only have about nine left only thank god
after the twentyfive you then wait two or three months they send you the check to your house
yes
yes after five in the afternoon you can call to whom you you can ah i mean you dial the telephone that comes up
that you have to call and you communicate there but it has to be after five in the afternoon because at that hour is when they change the
the the title of what they're talking about the topic
wow

and they are free they come a lot also come ah much much they make something that says  cheer chicago
and they bring a lot of music from colombia of mexico of all parts of puerto of the the world
aha aha aha
thank you yeah it is a little cold and a little hot
aha
aha
ha
no
ha
ha ha
ha
ha ha
ohh we've got a radio station here in chicago its 931 fm
they put on regueton all day long
hmmm
ha so specially when someones driving
you don't get bored because you put the the radio very loud and and the trip seems like
quickly and you don't get bored you don't sleep in the car or nothing
listening to mucis
yeah
no no
yeah yeah yeah
yeah
is like that music that i don't know if you are listening do you listen to the music that they have uh uh when they are when you are waiting for a person
that you pick the phone to talk i do not like that music because ah that music is like like classic and is music like when you
yeah
when you are going in elevators
the music they have for me for me
is not nice and they should change it they should play music ah merengue or bachata or the music
ah like like cumbias cumbias are nice
aha aha aha
aha aha aha no is that ah one falls asleep waiting
look right now i was waiting ah fifteen minutes so that they could connect me
aha the other time i was waiting half an hour and when they were going to connect me to someone they hung up on me because supposedly at eleven at night
is when they hang up the calls
aha aha aha
its its eleven minus twenty
how many times have you called
oh yes with this one it makes
it is thirteen
aha
no no they you they call you yes you can call and and after five pm you can call to an oh after five
whomever you want
no no js just one time
yes
aha
ohh
and a and there
aha aha
ohh
oh
oh lord you are missing a lot you're missing twentythree
because because the other time they put for politics
but i called and nobody nobody picked up the phone nobody nobody
but aha but to me at five in the afternoon every afternoon they call me here for someone that that
that if i want to get the phone to talk but since i don't get the phone because i don't know what topic they are talking about
since music is there this is the second time that i talk
i've talked to many people from from nebraska from philadelphia from miami
once yes it's me tammy again fine and you oh my god
because he can't get them all and that's bad because if they're not taking this things as they should be
they are not going to help you so that is scary
if its not mja or the welfare
right assistance that they give them here because they don't give you a lot so it's difficult and you have proof that you can show them that in truth
you have that but in any case if you do what it gives you its only if you work
and if you don't know they don't pay you well but they pay you twenty dollars or a little more than twenty dollars of the
i think less than twenty dollars of the limit they give you is not going to help
i say this because it's twenty dollars more than the limit that they have but i mean it's not a lot
an they don't want to so they prefer that you don't work
to be able for them to help you but with the help that they give you it's not enough to survive
no here well i think some things are going right but not others
no then that is the thing they can't they don't help you
they don't want to help you because you do a lot supposedly and a lot is not much you can't survive and you have to stop working so that they can help you
it's not that much m hah so it is difficult it's quite difficult for people to try to do that i think that i imagine that's why there are people who work under the table
because they can't say they're working because then they don't help him and they don't have enough and if you have children well that's another thing
no no so that because i was watching my son my kid the crazy that comes here to my house and tells me ah mom why don't you want to apply for government so that i get lunches
i say hey we do too much so that you get lunches i think i give you so that you buy lunches and i give the paper
four children wait four people in the house want you to make like twentyfour thousand dollars
that is not enough a year that is not enough
four people no specially if i take those people with a baby
because that will i say that's a lie i was showing my husband and i tell him those people are crazy who's going to do i say where you work and where you live because here where i live
specially the old people whom are not getting enough money or it's not the money but that they need medical help they're not getting their pills totally paid
no way that miracle that my son when he moved he found an apartment eh near to us that was seven hundred twentyfive a month and that is cheap
mm ha no that didn't include any of that so you imagine with two
so i say that if a person who has four people at home and makes twenty four thousand can't they can't
so for me that's why i always talk with my children be careful work take care of your your credit and save your money
because no way mmhmm ya do you remember that i spoke with you yesterday
my son is back the big one who move is in my house again he already got in a fight with the girlfriend and and the girl did something bad to him and that man my son when you do something to him he tells you goodbye and like that he never sees you again
so he got everything my husband went over there and grabbed all of his things and there is nothing of his anymore in that apartment
now he did leave
uh huh he very bad that this man got like that when he called me mom well and i tell him i support you so come over here i am going to convince him so that he goes to school because
he was but now he is i want well he can go uh uh the people from the job said that he can go to school in the morning
then it's more difficult to them you know take the their pills because they have to think  got to pay the pills or  got to eat
and work afterwards so they help him so i tell him well i say if you move here if you go to school i don't charge you rent
but if you don't want to go to school you're going to have to pay rent because i want for him to finish school
why is that i said lot of things specially with him yes him don't want to finish the school and he is going to have a hard time find things that is why i want
mja that is why there yes yes because is what i said then something happen and you don't do and it feels like you will end up asking for assistance and you won't have you are a man right
no is a necessity you are young not to finish things you have us here and we can help and you don't want to accept
i always put the example of person that we know look you don't want to finish work hard
mm i don't know how is in canada with him with this of the insurance
mja
aja mja aja
aja
because they have to pay more and there are sometimes people too whom abuse i know people that well they're not friends of mine but i know they're abusing
aja
no yes i don't know when my husband left he was in the armed forces
so we came here and they don't pay much either and that was in like ninety two
and so when we came here there was not enough to pay rent so we had to join for one month
to help us sufficiently and for how much time it would take him to find a job and that took him a month
well after a month of finding a job but you know the next check so it took us that month and we left once from there but when one goes to the store with those one of those that they give you that are fake papers
the people will yes when you go shopping that was years ago so now i think they give you a card
but the people look at you badly
right its not because they are helping you you look like you can work we could work but we didn't have me with two child's i mean i can't work already because where am i going to leave the kids that i have and i don't have enough to pay him
and so i said to my husband not ever again ever
from those uses that people really that other people really need
i mean i'll work wherever i can before going into that i've always thought that is so low i won't put my family through that
because they look down at you as a man if you are asking for help
you can't it's like things didn't go well for you so it's hard
aha they don't remember people don't remember that
but i'm not i'm not like that when i get to see someone that is in need and i go like this can happen to anyone in fact it happened to me the other day
s oh well i think
aha well i believe that they are not stealing anything they are not getting those because they acted crazy or because they are stealing they are
the went there because they had to go and ask for help they might even not have wanted to do it but they had to
aha
no no ah eh it's it's well they do send you a check
i know but it's difficult i have my sisterinlaw my the mother of my husband
well that was in ninetytwo i think i remember they used to send you a check and then a little book
a small pocket book that had something similar to the fake monopoly bills
and had the inscriptions of five dollars twenty dollars so you would have to pull it out and give it to someone and then they wouldn't give you change
so you had to give them the exact amount because otherwise you wouldn't get it back
so you had to be sure that you wouldn't use the coupons to buy alcohol or something like that because if you'd do that people would see the coupons and you would feel ashamed but nowadays they give you a card
and she is partially assisted but no she's not getting that much helo and it's necessary too she have to search for coupons and things like that so she can check if she could buy the medicine in another place to make it cheaper or
buy a medicament this month or other one the other month
betsy hello how are you
aha no
and that is the welfare or the pension
oh that is it right i can imagine
right
right
yes
yes
yes
but yes they don't pay you all the medicine you need
right
sitting here let's see what you have to say about the social work or whatever because i have no idea
and what they help is not enough anyway there's
uh huh uh huh
right but but after they're eighteen years old they don't help you anymore when your children are eighteen years old they don't help you anymore
mmha
uh huh
uh huh
twentyfour thousand dollars a year oh my goodness for four people no
uh huh
mm ha
mm ha but it doesn't include utilities
aham aham
uh huh oh okay uh mmhmm more expensive
mmhmm it's not enough
mmhmm ya that they don't spend it on things that they don't need
yes uh huh they already moved back
boy
wow
that girl had to have done something very bad mm
well yeah and when he moved with the girlfriend he wasn't working oh uh huh
mmhmm
ya it's good that way uh huh
oh
right mja
mja o have a good career also you are no going to send him to work at mcdonald's forever
mja
mja
no no don't want to because you want to that the government won't help for nothing
well here you have to work when we got here just arrived from del salvador that it was 15 years ago and the gives us a rent for an apartment
bed and sofas and we were with welfare
for a few months because we went to the school and then my parents found jobs and my brother and i were in high school
and then mi parents were working and help my brother because he was fifteen years old
and i was eighteen years old and they won't receive assistance for me only receive assistance for my brother but i was in high school and didn't work until until when
aha oh
yes but i was in the welfare sometimes but i think they assist you a little bit because you get a card for medicine
mja and this has to be presented in the store where you are going to buy the medicine and they pay it well that was the last time i asked for assistance
but now ah now i don't know how it must be it must harder
right
right
right
how great
really
oh right
they look at you as if you were from other planet

and i'm sure they are going through the same thing but they still look down on you
mja
oh yea of course
they look down at people who get government benefits real help it's not a big deal
aha i see

mhm yeah
it's not money i mean they are not sending you a check to your house or to you account

but also the humidity so we normally have i believe about seventy to eighty percent humidity
and when you leave the house
you know as soon as you leave you begin to sweat because it's as if someone is giving you a wet sheet
it's very you know it's very sticky and
but right now we are entering into an age that is not too bad it's hot but the humidity has lowered
but you know how for example y can wash my skin
ah
and i can be the entire night with wet hair
but i don't get dry because there is a lot of humidity
y especially if i clean myself in the morning and leave and i have it in a bun
my hair stays wet all day
so that you know it isn't always too hot like the humidity i believe
so that and there it's really cold still no
wow
and when do you normally have snow
when do you normally begin to have snow the time of snow and all that
so but when does it start to snow
ah no never been there
because i thought that that it snowed in new york
you didn't tell me that you are eh eh you live in new york
okay
i thought okay
okay no i thought that it was snowing in new york that's why it was that you were asking
oh sorry
no no eh my parents are from em the dominican republic
but i was born in puerto rico
and my father too
and puerto rican too
ah twenty something
mhm
sure
sure from haiti
yes from haiti
from haiti
from jamaica
i don't think so i mean we have a house but my husband is the only one who works and we have it's that you know
no we don't have a luxurious life
we have enough money for what we need to buy food pampers
you know to pay the the the electricity or whatever else but we don't have we don't have anything for vacations you know none of that
wow
we have what we need but
you now and we still have a car we don't need two cars and normally people have
two cars
no no we have just one car
no we don't have a house for around here it's a rather small house
oh we have three bedrooms
and two bathrooms it's not even that big and and here the houses they are very very expensive very expensive
and that you know what we if we have it's because we need it
but it's not a luxurious lifestyle
and we don't know you know we're not starving and we have clothes
so you were born in new york
but since i don't work i stay with my my girl
it is hard to us
am i think so we you see i i haven't bought any clothes for a year now i've bought things for the girl but i buy them at a consignment chop
yes you know we save a lot of money that way but i don't go shopping i don't do lots of you know i don't
go shopping because clothes are quite expensive
so if we buy clothes we go to places like costco
or sams or something like that
and we see if it fits if it's useful and we buy it there
but me shopping no i don't do that what
you know i don't care about you know to me yes yes i have clothes to wear but i don't care about designers or the
hello
yes oh well yes ah mm yes then we have to talk about traveling where do you travel
because these are these are three trips three flights i mean no i don't have any money to go anywhere then i think that after i finish school i am going to take a
a vacation of free time before starting to to work for
yes or to and to go somewhere where i want to go a different place not not to see family
mmh yes yes and that usually when you start working they don't let you take vacation for a while ah
there are places where the first three months you can not take vacation in others the first six months you can not take vacation
then yes how is your baby
yes yes growing up
aha aha aha
aha
mhm
yeah sure go on vacation
aha
yes
yes yes yes but rather that in the beginning they grow so fast
really quick yes until they're like two years old afterwards they begin to not like will still kind of continuing to gro
right
oh uh to
but right
where have you been in the united states
right
um
oh
um
hello it is sulma
right
oh
mm
mhm
aha
cla
mhm
mhm
but oh and when you've gone to arizona you've gone to to visit some tourist sites only to visit the
yes you went to the grand canyon
hello
aha and did you like it
yes yes
sure yes
uhm when in mexico have you gone only to visit your family or other places also
yeah
uhm
uhm
uhm
uhm
uhm
good and you
would you to visit some other country
alaska
hmm
it is too cold there
hmm
yes my ehm the boss i had before went to antarctica that is the south pole
yes to see the penguins because penguins are only on the south pole
and eh and he loved it there are cruises that you can take to go to alaska you take them from california and they take you to alaska
and then you get to see all of the glaciers and all the hmm
hmm
are you working right now
oh yes no
it takes time and money
yes yes it is difficult no it is it is i like
aha
no no tell me what you were going to
of course mmh
mmh
mmh
yes
of course yes it is difficult to balance visiting family and going on vacation especially when you get married because then you have to go visit your family and the
oh
family of the wife or the husband
then there was just time and and vacations and the money and everything is going at it
yes yes
mhm
mhm yes of course
mhm
mhm
yes of course
yes yes i love traveling i hope now that i start working on aa nurse and i started to have money to travel
for wherever you go but if uh i've been in europe and have been in costa rica and guatemala have been in mexico but only in mexico city
ah of course yes
puerto vallarta and chiapas
ah i was in st kitts and uh oh where else was in chiapas in eh i do not remember but oh and i was in taxco ah well when i
yes when i went to mexico
ah yes yes i've got a friend that loves to travel she loves to travel and stay for quite sometime in other countries she has just returned from spending two years living in
taiwan i went to visit her in mexico she had been there for six months because she was traveling through the country
so i went to visit her when she was in chiapas and from there we went to san cristobal oaxaca taxco and then we came back ah o
i came back she stayed
ah from mexico city well she was studying
she was studying so eh what she did was that she took some classes on her own and so while she was studying she was traveling throughout the country
yes yes so ah ah i've traveled with her ten times i haven't spent that much money cause we stayed in hostels i don't remember how you call those
a rest ah
but i mean you can stay there and you get to sleep in a room with lots of people but you pay almost nothing we paid
like two or three dollars per night
most of them are students so you share a room with people you don't know but
no it's people that
its doing the same to
they come to travel yes and they want to spend few money so stay like that good but also i was to europe and i stay a month too
traveling for europe that come out very expensive but my parents help me because it was my gift for the university graduation so after i was here in houston
i only went to aruba its in the north cost of venezuela
ok and its a little island like puerto rico but i don't like it its a place very famous and tourist in the caribean but i dont like it
because puerto rico its also an island and puerto rico has more green places and there are mountains and this little island is very desertic there isn't nothing
well well you work in construction you had told me no
absolutely nothing its the only one in the beaches they are very nice but beside that there is nothing else to see
in aruba yes
yes its very dry there is absolutely nothing there is very flat there are stones that's all rocky
in the beaches are rocks
yes the sand is white and the water is very clear you can see through the water is clear blue
but there isn't nothing else to see absolutely nothing
so i don't like but i have lucky that all my family is in puerto rico except for a sister that lives in florida
the the rest are in puerto rico but even then like that and now for example this year i went to see my sister in florida and then in in august
and then i went to puerto rico to see my family and now in december i go to canada to see my boyfriend's family
then i no longer have time or money to go anywhere else
hello
mm the the the best i could do one no
oh yes to mexico
only to mexico and here here in the united states i've been to different places
uh on vacations not from work on vacations
uh
in texas
when i was in texas i traveled from here to there
i have family here and there
now that i'm living here i travel to i travel there or to nebraska with my brothers my brother who's there
i also have family in arizona all my uncles
ah i am manuel from
all uh almost all the family on my mother's side is here in the united states
further that in different states or i do have on in wisconsin where i also sometimes stay
i will look closely at that
and then what did you say for traveling when you have time i like to go by car driving like this
because you can go when you want to and stop to rest when you want
well with the family you have to stop and rest
if you go by bus anymore you will only stop once and it is very uncomfortable
and so nothing more
ah grand canyon
yes
chicago how are you
oh it's beautiful
it's nice even though in itself it is very much like a desert
but it does have lots of pretty things
then i have family in two states in durango and in monterrey
ah monterrey then have lots of ah is like how would i say it they have lots of tourist areas to visit eh to get to know
ah it's an industrial city then there are many what can say there are thing you can do and they are things you can't they are not too many things but it is pretty
it has two i am not sure if they are exactly rives one is called horsetail
they are towering like enormous waterfalls
that o that one is also visited by lots people from other areas
it is pretty
very good very good working
oh yes i would love to visit alaska
yes
go to to know what the is
ehm what the exactly to what cold really is
i would like to be there
yes
yes
yes yes known something
yes yes i yes i would like somewhat to get to know around there
but sometimes there is no time
yes
and when
when you have time sometimes you don't have money
what what happens is
how yes tell me
oh what happens is that i tell you as when one has vacations one well at least i ah and i try to
to go out but go where my family is go and visit family some times ah
hard two or three years without seeing them
you have one opportunity well i prefer well of course to see my family than going on vacation also well i don't know
eh we like we are very very close we see each other a lot
and well better there are times that we go out we make plans to better go see family
yes as soon as the call arrived i said eh well to entertain myself a bit rest a bit
oh speaking of which that is another problem
yes it is rather the time because ah i'll tell you that money does not spend much when you go to see family and do not spend much when you go to
no you're going for a walk to know different ah city or country
there if you spend more because you have to spend hotels food
logically you know wherever you walk you're going to spend money
to get away with to visit family if you spend do not say no but
not spend much
it's very different
that's good
oh really
eh
oh taxco
on holidays
yes my vacations
oh
mm that's good
mm
but since they are staying there at least you know you are among people there's no there's no danger in that
they are they are
oh exactly the people is doing the same
ok
how are you
is desertic there
yes
yes
look
mmm
well yes
to rest
well that is good because starting to work you are going to be starting you don't exactly know how you are going to have well practically your life rhythm is going to change no
mmh
see
yes
oh very well thank you
yes he is good growing growing since the day he was born he was born on wednesday on saturday he had an appointment with the pediatrician we took him
and he had gained almost a pound
ah the doctor was chatting with is right i was there ah i was there a while talking with him he was telling is that everything was going very very well that she had put on so much weight because a lot of children
when they're born normally they tend to slim down a little bit to lose weight
and and this girl didn't lose anything and she actually did the opposite and gained weight
that's great
mm well i hope that everything continues to go well and there's no problems
yeah
ah betsy you are speaking with alex again how are you
and to jibrartal and i liked it a lot but the southern part of spain where the beaches are
they robbed me in a subway train
and they took my purse
and they stole like i don't know 100 dollars
yes or perhaps more what in spain
and in colombia where where they are very famous for these things of
pickpocketing never happened to me because that's one of the reasons i'm always alert
and in spain when you're alert
yes yes and and you know a little while ago there was a terrorist attack there
yes some trains exploded they put bombs in them and there were some people they were arab terrorists
and people died in spain and this happened in the stations i frequented
eh the landscape was very nice
some years ago i was in the places where the attacks happened
like a year ago
yes then well you know if something bad is going to happen to you
then something bad will happen to you no matter where you are
but i didn't have the money to stay for too long
and that always caused me frustration and so if i were to win a prize and had the money
and also the time and of course when you have money you must have time
and so i would love to travel to spain and visit the
there are many castles and interesting things over there
ah many things from the the old world many roman things ah it's interesting it's it's to know history
and but you need money it's it's an expensive country specially for touring
and it is not no very dangerous where i'm from colombia it's very dangerous
good yes well the topics is trips
you don't enjoy there although it is a beautiful country but
you are always afraid about the country security
no spain is better
dangerous
yes
colombia is also a fantastic country is there were no wars and
you have some terrific landscapes and montains
yes and we also have coast there but the problem is the war yet and the
and oh the drug dealers that has totally damaged that country and i figure up the thinking you have is terrible
yes oh what else what do you like to travel inside united states or inside canada
yes something interesting
yes they have told me that it is beautiful but cold
yes
where do you live
there is no snow
impossible
you are way to the north it never snows
yes
because here in los angeles it never snows unless one goes to the mountains
yes
but if it falls it must fall because you are way to the north betsy
yes i have had many different oppitions
yes you are close to alaska
yes near seattle washington
do you know seattle washington
i would like to know around there
yes and also washington dc one time i went to the capital
it has beautiful things museums history i like all that has to do with history and a classic city is montreal canada
they say that canada is very pretty
and no there is not insecurity like here in the united states
here in the united states it is ugly
it is almost almost like latin countries now
well do you want to start this time
yes that's why they criticise immigration a lot here because a lot of the migration here is bad
and has damaged the country a great deal
through the years i have seen that this country has really deteriorated and now in the united states there is a big difference between rich and poor
that wasn't the case before in canada i believe it's more balanced
there there isn't such a big difference betwen rich and poor in canada as there is here in the united states
but there are more social programs there
and there there are not so many people the problem here is that there are a lot of people
yes the country has been unfortunately going downhill quite a bit
yes it's dangerous there
they can rob you they can do something to you there's a lot of misery it's almost like a latin country no i see a big difference there
and why
yes and you know the latin countries are known for the difference of the poor and the rich
and that's becoming that's how the united states is becoming
yes but there are interesting things and once i went to texas and i liked the scenery
i've always liked the colombian plains
super hot but very beautiful
and the texan plains are similar a bit more developed and oh i love the barbequed meat
and a lot of barbeque meat was being bought in those places
is interesting i would like to get to know texas more
for its scenery most of all for its plains i love the plains the prairies the cowboys i like
and the barbeques
is your husband canadian
i love barbecues like they say in colombia the barbecues
and that is found a lot in texas
yes yes i think that it is one of the most interesting parts of the united states and seattle i would like to get to know for its coffee they say that there is good coffee there
yes yes
over there there are volcanoes yes
yes i remember and there must be pretty landscapes around there
there's security
yes that is the problem of all of the latin countries that that have never been able to overcome
yes hopefully one day they'll be able to do it l
yes yes but and i have heard that the countries there are pretty because there are a lot of volcanoes
yes a cruise would be fantastic
and mountains do you know el salvador's beaches how are they
what are  huge waves waves or something
because here is both the pacific and the atlantic
how many coast do you have only pacific
yes
yes
because colombia has both the atlantic and the pacific colombia has 2 coasts
that's ways is a nice country i tell you colombia overpasses a lot of countries in beauty
as a country is the worst but as in beauty it has a lot of it
it has a lot of queens
well me once i traveled to spain
but there's a lot of bad stuff
yes there is a lot of stuff i don't deny it no one can denied the truth
from a situation there are wrong things
and more than that there is insecurity eh
and when you are a tourist you don't want to go some place where can happen something wrong
right you want to travel some place where there is not a lot of insecurity
but i have to tell you something is going to terrify you
i never was robbed in colombia
let me tell you i was robbed once in spain
yes ma'amm that's true
betsy yeap oh hi alex
yeah a cruise because i have never been i have never been in one before and you
really
very strange

hi hello good night where are you from
oh a lotm and by ah because we are speaking of travelin have you traveled to puerto rico
oh yes
then ah you had not lived always in colorado you traveled or you travel only for vacations and no more
oh no yet not a lot yet only utah and i don't know utah and nothing the truth is not i wente to washington
to washington sure but no no by by this sure someday i hope i can no
oh to study
we came after my graduation from fro school to study college here
well i went to utah and i met my husband there and now we are living in idaho
well we went back to chile only once five years ago and
we hope to be able to go back now you know maybe next year
from colorado and where were you born
not so much it's more expensive from idaho i think that if we were in florida or california i colorado is on the north right
at the center ah okay then it's like lower but to the center
then it's a little easier for you to travel
yeah
ah no really
oh yes that's why we don't go anywhere because just anything will be like 300 dollars or so by ticket it's very expensive
yes and have you been outside of america like europe or something like that or you haven't had the chance
ah yes
what country what country would you like to visit if you could
oh yes to australia
ah i'm i'm now in idaho and i'm originally from chile
yes look yes for me if i could choose i think it would be italy
yes i don't know i think that italy but australia is huge australia there's so much to do
oh
and sure
oh so you're going to be
of course at least for another fifteen years no
of course when she doesn't want anything more to do with you for a while no
of course no now is hard
yes we have small children also and that makes it so hard to be able to travel anywhere
clearly
am here in the states ten years and three years in idaho
ah then you are going to take her there but more or less at what age are you thinking of taking her
sure
wow then it's constantly
sure
sure
i can imagine
sure
oh yes i imagine how old was she
oh very little she did not understand yet clearly
yeah
yes very much it's a bit like colorado no colorado has lots of snow
ah yes that is it
no but it is good that you like to travel because then she will want to travel because there is people that really do not like to travel and i can not believe
that you do not like to travel
sure
sure one has to be responsible and since we have children
have your feet on the land for a while
i heard it is super slow
many forest no
and how many years have you lived in colorado
wow
sure
mhm
mhm
ah and she was american or where was she from
ah
oh yea
clearly well it's because we don't change much right
in those years
clearly
a yes oh and that one she is from mexico
aha
sure and in puerto rico is not like that righ
mmh
how weird no yes she is cute
where does she live
aha with the girl
ah then you can see her often
ah how cool
look how great
and it is going to be nice now when if you are from puerto rico you have no travel to enter and exit the united states right
i have never understood that what what what role the united states has with puerto rico because it is not a state it is a separate country but at the same time
aha
oh but no snow like
oh not that much time
sure
oh
independent
how long have you lived there
good night i'm joe
oh no never no
oh i have a lot of years living here more than twenty
well look that since the ninety three since my parents died it was the last time i went to puerto rico but i had traveled to other parts i went to mexico
i also went to other parts to parts of the united states also including florida that is a
one of my favorite places
for vacations to other states there is a lot to see i don't know if you had the chance to see other parts of the united states
there are lots of very nice parts
washington state it is very beautiful there
and how you came to idaho to stay
ah
i'm from colorado
yeah
very good
and
is it very difficult to go there from here with the passports and things like that
sure it's more or less at the center we're lower than you
yes it's a centric place for flights from here there are a lot of flights to south america too
yes for example if i wanted to go to cancun on vacation
and i went there three days with 350 dollars
that would include hotel and flight yes
it probably would be easier for you to go to the state of washington or go to a more centric place and fly wherever you wanted from there
i'm from puerto rico
no i'd love to go to europe my brothers that one lives in wichita kansas and the other lives in puerto rico they travel a lot
they've been all over europe and they've told how nice it is over there paris spain
i'd like one of my favorites is australia
yes and i would love australia because is very exotic over there and also new zealand but i would also love to visit italy spain france all those places but i think that australia still remains number one for me
italy yes italy is beautiful
is a lot of history yes well i worked for a company that the president and owner of the company was australian so there we formed a good friendship and all that
and he always would invite to go over there but i have a five year old daughter i'm a divorced father
and i have joint custody
so
i would never abandon never leave her behind
from chile good how long have you been here
yes yes when she forgets she has a dad and starts thinking more in the boyfriends yes
yes yes but for now i'm crazy about her and she's crazy about me and
we have a really good time
yes exactly well i want to go to puerto rico next year so that she knows the puerto rican side of her family because her mother is mexican
then i want her to know that and she is crazy about going and seeing her grandmother her grandmother comes here every year and they get along well those two have great chemistry
she well she has traveled many times in a plane
she's traveled more than me in the last three years because she goes to mexico with her mother at least twice a year
oh she is well accustomed to traveling and is very calm from what i told you about the first time that we traveled well it was not it was not in a plane but when i took a trip to wichita
i took one of these greyhound buses and it was an awful experience because she was still very little and when we got up in the bus
she was sleeping but when she woke up she completely panicked
ten years oh and do you like it here do you miss your home country a lot
i think that she thought that she had one of the worst nightmares and the people there were very uncomfortable and they said things to me
and it was a rather lousy trip but
she was around two years old then
yes and i promised her that i would never take her again in a guagua there we call it guagua
then the next time we went on a plane a small plane and we had a great time and he was happy and not to mention it was alone only
one hour of travel compared to thirteen hours when we take the bus
yes
it was horrible
i would love to see all the planet if i could
because i would love to travel as much as i can but in reality the situation i see it very difficult
and does it change often this season does it change
yes exactly
yes exactly yes but have yes they have an opportunity to go to other places come to colorado it is beautiful
is beautiful you live here
there are lots of national forests they have majestic mountains they have attractions in town they have all a little there is a lot of things but you leave here and you do in the mountains and you see places that are fabulous and the beauty is like if you were in paridise
i have been living here for twentysix years
in december i will be twentysix yes well yes i came straight well i went for a small time to new york but only for a small amount of time
so i came here with my ex my first wife
then we were married for about ten years and then we both went our separate ways
but shshe is half puerto rican and half russian
she was was my high school sweetheart
is it only hot or hot to cold
yes well we get a long well and we ended well we just found out that we both had different goals in the end
changed a lot yes yes
the mother of the girl well that was a really short marriage
it didn't even last two years
yes she is from oaxaca mexico
well we have a good parental relationship with the girl we work very well with her in fact today we went to her kindergarten school
then to see what the teacher told us and the teacher gave a god report about the girl because my girl is a very good girl she has a good heart and
has such a sweet voice that everybody likes
she has she behaves very well she is very respectful she is a she has much love for god and she has she has you know good principles and very hungry to learn
in my exwife you say
now puerto rico it's kind of the same weather all year long but yes it does have some rainy times and also sunny times during the year like
she lives very close to here i live in aurora colorado and she lives like three miles from here
yes i see her three times a week every week more in other activities like today for example well
we share together with her
yes that is good
not at all
well it was invaded by the americans in eight hundred ninetyeight
they took it from the spanish from there they established american governors and from there well they weri under submission until they started to gov to put puerto rican governors
like in one thousand nine hundred fifty fiftyfour they gave citizenship to all the puerto ricans
but puerto rico it hasn't it hasn't been that long for example when my parents were born they weren't citizens but i have been a citizen my whole life
and then well from there on well the commonwealth was established which is one free association with the united states but without being a state
in july we can have lots of sun and lots of rain in may
over there they vote for the primaries over there they vote the primary for the president from here but they don't vote for the elections for president from here
so in some way it is independent in some way they have a lot of
ti dependence or union with the united states it would be very difficult that puerto rico would become a totally independent country because
it would have to be approved first over there and they have never approbed it and they haven't approbed either
good night mildred from connecticut
mmm
what type of music do you listen to
rock and all that ah
regueton and all that
ah
yes me yes i listen to everything regueton rap and all
rock do notliki listen but don't like for a long time for little while okay but all night listening to rock no
i am not much of a rocker
but the bachata merengue salsa all music classic music
romantic musicnice yes i believe that music makes people be recognized it lets you recognize people from all different country's
mildred
and
ahh ahh
i think that united people although there are different nacionalities there are people from mexico that like the salsa there are people
from other countries that like salsa the merengue yes yes the bachata when you go to the dance
ai
they are differente countries dancing
i like a lot the mexica music also because it has beat specially the rancheras i love them yes
i like it a lot
yes ahh
yeah very nice very nice and chinese too chinese music
and where are you from arturo
yeah i mean specially if you could play well it would be even more beautiful because they almost always uh they present like a story when they do shows about them with the women that are waving their hands
yeah and their fans
they use it for like for like telling a story
yeah the if we go back to previous times the indians made their their
their dances and all and they were and the the slaves were the first ones that used music for for like complaining like to be able to say
how wrong they were treated with that they expressed all their their
their unhappiness
i think that music will always for centuries and centuries and it will go on you know
even if it's different at the about the type they choose it's always going to unite people wherever you go because you know reggaeton and you already know who it was and sometimes
and don't know if you remember there was a band of japanese guys the light band
oh i see we have talked before right
they started to perform salsa
yes they were japanese and they had spent a lot of time here i don't know what the finally did but they performed in new york they had some original discs and they performed the
same salsa discs that they made before sounded a bit japanese too
then i'm sure that if a japanese would come here in america would say i heard that song before
even i don't get what they're saying but
mhm yeah i think that music is beautiful and relaxing
you listen when you relax
and i have discs of that coquí of puerto rico and the recorded music it comes from the river
you can relax with that
when one wants to be calm at home one can put their candles those with scent and be relaxed that helps a lot
i'm sorry
mhm yes and music is necessary it's necessary because it is what maybe if we didn't have music people would be like a
even a little more aggressive too
because music calms him
uh huh
uhm
oh
yes almost always how do you say it they extradite from the country they they vote
yes because it was protest music what they call right
in puerto rico they had the topo the topo and who else is it that sang protest music juan manuel serrat used to sing protest music and sometimes when they had concerts they didn't want to allow them you know
because they sang the truth about the people
yes
against the governments and all that they
they tired to boycott them and that people wouldn't go
but it's interesting because that tells stories
mhm yeah i think the same i think that
like i i tell you i think that there's a big need for music
it tells love stories it tells of misfortunes it tells about people's problems
daily life is used for many things
yeah i think that i love music i think that when when i play it i clean the house quicker
no look i've always liked the piano and my daughters took piano classes but i never had the chance to to that my mom had the money to pay me classes of
i really like the guitar and the harp
puerto rican
the harp is an an instrument that isn't used a lot anymore but i find that it has a beautiful music
yes the harp is very beautiful you know what i like as well i love accordion music too
aha sure in in puerto rico they use it the the people of of of what we call of gicaro from the fields when they're going to do the parties on christmas and that then they use it
but you don't play any instrument
my boyfriend plays my boyfriend plays the bass he played it too because not anymore he's old now not anymore
but
he played with bands and with orchestras and he played the bass
mhm
ok it relaxes you
that is good
yes today's topic is music
it is good here we have many
because he he does dj
he dos dj so there is music all over the house
and every he spends his time on the internet recording discs
y we do discs for people if they want to
something we have done parties and we do it and he is the one that records an entire cd in person and we gift it to him
yes
aha
do you like it
hi how are you what's your name
do you play any instrument
well all types eh music this a little bit of jazz clasic music and also i listen to a lot like i don't know contemporary music just like alternatives and fusions like that
fusion from jazz with funk
a little of everything what do you listen
no do you like regueton
do you like regueton
yes yeah
no i am am i am very rocker
yes
yes yes but
mildred this is arturo
lately i believe this also is lost as well because the music now is made mainstream an example hip hop that today everyone is making the same music
in united states in mexico in everything is an imitation and nothing else is taking like or is has convert in a global type
in the world the the heard i think yes to me i don't like it but i am affected how the whole world is adapting to hip hop
inside the music i thikn is like the regueton is doing a lot
in mexico the mexican music is using lots the hip hop there is more like bandas of rock that are using hip hop or something like that
yes
yes yes
yes i like to dance a lot the merensge and salsa also
yes
yes the rancheras
i'm from mexico but right now i'm at philadelphia
yes there a good i like them too but i think is like good to know music from other countries like
ah had you heard music from arab or turk sometime
interesting isn't good also
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
right well everybody kind of tells a story with music too i mean in every way music that has no lyrics well it's also telling it's kinda painting a picture i mean like
a stage like that it has lyrics well it's always talking about something or related to a feeling or a story i mean mexican music like corridos
they're very known because they tell stories right about different people different things that have happened but they're very particular stories very good sometimes
yeah
yeah
it might be
oh
yes yes yes
sure
yes ha
aha
no almost
japanese girls oh
no never listen to them
right
yes that too
it might be where are you from from puerto rico
relaxing and a bit distracting
ah
yes
uh huh ah yes like only background sounds or that are
yes no well it's that music is
also even the music that is too eh like aggressive it helps as relief no also music can be very important as well like for the liberation so like
there's a singer that is called there's music afrobid he's called cela kuti and this sir well in he for for the civil war of of of nigeria
he was really important because he with all his music made the movements of the revolution that is the people didn't didn't didn't see him as a musician but more like a political leader
that that through his music moved people then when he put out new records
the the military became furious and sometimes they i mean he had a whole community of like of practitioners with him that had his same political philosophy
oh i have talked to you
and they all lived together in communities and when he put out a record that was called zombi which criticized the army because they were well like a a puppet of the government that were
like killing people of their own race
he all of this said it in his song and the military heard it and
yes yes they threw him out him well they imprisoned him and hit him and burned all his house and all the
exactly the music
aha yes of course
yes it's yes
people got agitated and the government doesn't like that
yes
yes of course that's recorded in history as well music always will reflect what people are living in that moment and what they are thinking
i talked abouti don't reallybut right now it's about music
yes that's good
yes always
yes
yes yes everything mhm yes yes yes i think that it's it's essential that the air i think we couldn't live without
yes and you don't play music don't play any instrument
yes
ah the harp
yes not so much in fact i had a friend in school that that she played the harp very beautiful yes
yes but yes as you said the yes well the mexican music uses the accordion a lot
yes yes yes
yes music is really nice
i do play this the guitar the bass and and well i tried for a while the piano but it was very hard i i couldn't
well better that way
aha
yes
it's always good to play music i think
also it serves to unload when i want to distract myself or something i take my bass and play a little
i get distracted if it relaxes me
yes
mhm
ah
yes a lot
oh okay
yes
yes
yes
my father yes my uncle does something like him he is also like a dj
but now he does not work much in that he pretty much does the jo other jb but but he also records
good night i am joe
good good growing becoming very pretty and sweet
hey do you have
sorry continue
oh i remember that
yes
yes crime can happen anywhere
that's the sad thing that you
yes and not trust certain people so much with strangers specially
i i always teach my daughter not to trust strangers and to be very careful
yes and you start teaching them no one can touch them here and there and
yes
ay yes really so little she says she asks me when can she have a boyfriend i tell her it is going to be a long time my daughter before that is possible
yes just about it can be
that that talking about tonight's subject
well denver is a city considered big but eh we
i live in aurora which is next to denver
it is a city also and it is rather populated but it doesn't have the high rise buildings of denver
i would not say it is more quiet i would say that
because it has a mixture of everything
of good people of bad people of all ethnic groups there is crime is rather high here and you live it seems with a bit of fear
how are you cristina
then yes i used to live in a house now i live in an apartment and and i have found several bad situations around here
including shooting and things like that
well if if i could leave well i would go to a calmer place in a town better then a city
because i am very tiered of the city in fact the daily driving here and the traffic in denver is horrible
too many cars too many and where i take my little girl a eh where she goes to school it takes me a long time sometimes i drive an hour and half in the morning before i have to go work
yes it is a little by the time we get to work we are already stresed
and with a headache yes
yes
what is a town
yes
i'm from puerto rico but i live in denver colorado
yes it goes that way
yes
yes
yes
and how about crime how is it
ah that's awesome
oh is not the same around here in aurara
news aren't about crimes or anything like that
wow what a wonderful thing
well then i'm moving right now and i'll be your neighbor
oh i have a lot i have about twenty six years here
well is the very opposite of denver
and aurora aurora
yeah
the people in colorado as well mm we like going to the mountains to camp and all that
but there's people from around the whole world here and
a lot of people that came here have brought bad things as well
so things happen and people live with fear
i always live in fear with my daughter because they always talk about it in the news that the talk about a crime in aurora
what yeah gun shots what if they stole that what if they run over a kid and the driver left without telling anyone
things like that
yes and you
sorry
yes
and the cars and the cars here you leave a cd
nothing like that because they break your window to steal it
the cd's and
i never leave anything that may call attenttion to my car
oh that's great i dream of a place like that the only thing that
i have i am divorced parent my daughter
she and i have um or rather my exwife and i have divided custody
yes i i would never want to leave my girl behind i want to be here with her until she grows up
ten years from where are you
and one day she said oh daddy i will get married and will forget me i hope not but i know that that happens sometimes
well a lot happens
but nothing i would like to yes live in a quieter place my brother lives in kansas
and it's very quiet over there too
the have festivals people are more quiet no
yes there are many nice things here not everything here is is ugly like that but
it's that since there are so many people living and more people moving in and the and and the city i mean there are cities in colorado that are gro growing the fastest in all america
in eh that also brings its problems
yes
yes
i hadn't spoken with you the other nights
no here but the opposite here they have the
yes
yes
and many parts here are tranquil and here they have every type of attraction for the family
for adults for singles everyone in reality they have a lot of things here in fact where i work it is a zone where there are many high tech companies
so also until the amphitheater there remains like a block of distance from where i work and sometimes we hear the concerts from where we work
from the building
yes or no here the activities are not lacking the only thing is sometimes and particularly in the city where i live there is a lot of crime i would like
there are other parts here the neighboring zones that are pretty peaceful and
and good neighborhood even though they have a lot of people they take good care of each other and like you say they have open faces and they don't have the fear that they will be robbed or anything like that
yes i think so that you have your family your spouse your kids
in this it's at least it's a mix of the good and the bad
listen and the bad guys then are those who like to take advantage
and you live with fear and peacefully
but the traffic is horrible let me tell you
it's it's incredibly horrible because sometimes the taxi drivers and in winter it's even worse because when they start to have all these accidents you can't move on the highway
it's terrible
but i always dream like that with a tranquil little spot one day i think who knows it will be possible when when
she lives right close by about one no two miles from here
in what used to be my house uh huh and also the house of my exwife that was my house then we both stayed there at one time we both were there
there because the house has three stories
yes a little girl of five years old
and the the basement like isn't really a basement the windows stayed up
so then they went through the back part in the basement like the bottom part and they stole a bunch of things from her
no she had left with some work i went to the house and examined and i recommended her that they had to bloc this and that for
they shouldn't leave it in an open area right
so she did it that way also in her car at work where she parks in a non good place and they've gotten her car like three times
three times they've broke her crystals they've stole her cds the stereo
yeah it is that's the bad thing about living in the city any kind of attractions but there's also lots
disadvantages
i miss it
exactly
good night cristina from idaho
you go at ten you're going to have to be careful with the kids no
and the relax and all that
and
oh for example when that happened here it was big news at least here of this man that came and and killed a family and took two kids
yes because precisely they live here in the country and the kids i mean you never imagine that someone was going to come around these places and
and
of course
and you always have to be careful always
of course so
yes but you realize that when you have kids you start with all those worries oh is terrible
of course when you don't have kids at least you take care of yourself no but
when you are around twentyfive years old no
when you have kids and no
and how
yes how is colo how is it where you live in is it a big city or do you live in the city or do you live outside
ah
aha
ah and a little quieter
ah
hm mm
hm mm
good from where are you
ah yes
ah and would you like momove where would you like what type of place would you like to live in
ah
should be
wow
the headache no
what difference man here is super calm
super super calm eh
is good idaho in yes the state of idaho is good eh town i would say
i mean the largest city is boyce
ah as of four years
but it is a calm city and and it is a small city
and that's the biggest city after that one i'd say would be idaho idaho falls but i consider it as a but town
cause is not a city cause there aren't any big buildings or things like that or any buildings really
and so is like the one round here is a little big town but umm
oh nothing ever happens people round here leave their doors open the cars unlocked
and
of course is very quiet look the news around here are boring like nothing ever happens around here
if anything were to happen it'd be
the news of the month but nothing absolutely nothing happens around here
sometimes its too quiet round here
oh
yes it is very quiet and a lot of people live in the country so yes is very quiet
eh yeah
like i say its too much it was too quiet there's not much to do i mean people that live here like things like um
camping and fishing and go skiing and
of course
of course
of course
of course
of course
of course
i have ten years in
like the city
us we lived in when i lived in chile i lived in santiago for a while which is the capital
and of course is is different to live in the city or rather you do not leave open doors you you don't trust in anyone generally and
of course
everything
yes not every where but
of course not here is very peaceful to me is very very peaceful but is fine because since i have children is good to raise children and all that
for this reason
of course
you must stay close of
from chile
of course
yes
aha
sure no
a bit more relaxed
sure
sure
yes and that's what i miss because here there's not much to do apart from outdoors stuff there's no opera here there is no eh places to
the mall is very small there are no places to visit or places ballet or concerts and things like that there are no such things here
so one in a more city you know as i tell you pulsy or city that is in utah
i think so sounds the voice sounds familiar
and and if you like to do things like that go to concerts or go to see you know an opera a play or anything like that a show
there's no there's no you have to drive some four hours three hours to to see something like that there's not much going on here the only thing that the universities here have are little shows and this like that but
that's what you miss from the from the city no that
that you can find this type of fun but at the same time it is
with peace and all that i liked that a lot when we lived in utah
in city it is like city that has everything that you want
and it's tranquil
clearly
yes
clearly
yes you have a little girl no
yes you see that and i would like to be close to something like that somethings that had activities and other things
yes
of course
of course
of course
of course
yes i don't miss that
oh the snow and ice and all of that oh
oh and that it's nothing unusual
good if well when when and now where does your daughter live she lives close by too right
ah yes yes i remember how is your daughter
oh
i see
ha
oh they weren't there right
of course
oh that's bad
that's horrible
of course you have to
you have to be careful
of course one relaxes here and that's the problem because we are missing who we get you know the other side and they take advantage of the circumstances people that don't trust anyone
hi good afternoon
and well just the weather i'm telling you i can't get used to it it makes me cranky
i swear that in the morning i will turn to the window and i get get mad oh again
oh i am at the highrises yeah
yes where
no no no no i lived before coming here i lived in i lived in singapore for two years and before that my life had been in mexico city all my life
yes
yes well yes i already used to the the tropics
s then is tropic really nothing more then
yes i arrived there and yes it was like today what is happening
yes
mayra speaking here
and in the air that has been a week and i don't understand how this can survive
yes
yes yes yes the cold you can stand it but until december once christmas is over what happens is that
when you come back you feel like oh well now christmas is over and you think that the cold is going to be over
cold weather is for christmas and so you come back and it's just worse that's when it hits me and i'm like  oh no
go go away please
yes
oh really
oh aha
oh you can't
memo are you memo
and i was thinking about going there but i didn't that was great because i wouldn't have survived i swear i wouldn't survive in there
aha
ah
today they're poor
oh
today they poor
he looks for it
oh
what grade is your brother in
ah ok
who are you
is good
of what of crime
here in philly i have not been informed of much or say i hear there are some persons whom they robbed at the forty and one or whatever
but i believe i have always been very lucky because i have been walking at night alone on forty and one and i like to go to the store of
to the stores of fruites at the forty and eight and when i want i go there and nothing has ever happened to me
yes i myself also and like that enchanted life also or is don't don't think that i put attention i am not scared or anything
and nothing has ever happened to me and i have never had a reason to get scared or anything and nothing on the contrary everyone is super nice when i go there
then i don't i believe that
i believe that i'am lucky because in mexico is the same or is all my friends in mexico have a history that they have been robbed or kidnapped or they have done something to them
and nothing has ever happened to me i am always by myself at the bad hours of the night in bad places and like that like that all things they say you are not supposed to do
oh again
i've done all of those at the same time and nothing has ever happened to me
yes yes i swear like that that hmm i see what i've done yes i remember what i did and how dared i
what was i thinking sure i was an irresponsible teenager but well nothing ever happened to me
then i don't know no i don't necessarily feel so insecure because of reasons but you you know philly
oh yeah how is it
aham
yes
yes that too
yes yes there's a lot
ok
how are you
yes
yes in general in philadelphia there are still so many areas where you wouldn't want to go
i don't like it or to be out at night like at the center city there are some place that i don't like to walk
but i don't know sometime because i don't know the city well i think or i don't know the people here
or when i was in mexico if someone passed me or something i would go across the street
and here is not like it at all and i don't know to to fear and who not to fear
well no no no
yes
uhum
yes also
fine how's everything how is school going
listen but little so you don't know anybody from philly that has a history of a that they had stolen something from them
uhum ok
uhum
yes that also too
of course besides it's not that weird to happen when you are walking or in
the 43th that's how always occurs but they can't also do that
yes it's really quiet
don't worry about anything
yes and there is not light
and no light
good
in the blocks
umm
yes
me fine everything's cool uh with i've finished all exams well you see i'm in that week in which you just you can't do anything
hello good afternoon what
oh no
no but but where are you or where do you live
oh before coming here
oh before coming to study here
oh oh so then there is
yes it is very hot or there is much more hotter than here
it is very hot in singapore right
yes
oh and so then here it's it's cold and
uh
oh mayra oh how's it going it's josé
no it's cold and yes yes there is no sun oh yes i know no well the summer feel good but one one week like this of of a bit of cold and of
like that uh ah not much i like it but still yes i know that it's just the beginning you know of a horrible winter
so ah that's what i hate about it but
uhum
ah
yes i know it's like my brother is studying in cornell it's way up to the north and it's about six hours away from philadelphia but it's
much more high up to the north
and they begin classes until the end of january around the twenty eight of january or
yes yes that's because the weather is terrible so they move the calendar and they go to classes way into may and they rest in the early days of january right the students because it's
brutal the weather there in cornell philadelphia's weather it's not that bad correct cornell's is it's just too much
hello um
my brother
the truth is not that me and my brother had the luck because um that gave him a what they say one of the town houses
but it was much bigger then we went in and saw the living room and kitchen and then up one floor and there they had all their rooms but
it was quite large but the problem is that they were one of the new dormitories at the university
and had built outside of the university so i was very far from the university and the classes
engineering was at the other end of the university
and and said that he is oh and also is that i say no right then i say but i say ha no there is a bus system there of of
there public transportation why not use it no i do not want to pay fifty dollars to use it
true then the last step and walking throughout the semester and in the winter it wasn't twenty degrees and we began to walk forty minutes to get to class it is
oh that is my brother
it's josé
no that is not it
but why not not if it is cheap right i did not want to pay fifty dollars yes is that this is ridiculous then
not because the bus only goes four times an hour then do not want to wait fifteen minutes for such a thing
oh is that my brother i don't know
no but um now he is in third grade
yes yes but
and and what do you think of of crime here in filadelf
eh of crime yes
uhum
and you walk to the forty and eight
yeah again
oh
yes yes
hmm hmm
to the
eh
hmm well i don't well to me
for me is the uh with me it's almost the same story right because i've never never had anything happen to me here
here near the university i live in walnut and 38 between between between 38 and 39
then it's not far and here there is a lot of security and then but in general i i don't know anyone that that has done anything i mean seriously i think that
of course it happens right sometimes you see it on the newspaper and one
fine and you
but in general it's pretty occasional because in in these areas there is so many security and ah they have cameras
and and lights and they have those phones and they have the people the the the policeman that ride on the bike that it's incredible what they what they have
and they spend a lot of money but also it it's like in general they keep it pre pretty safe
i can imagine that the people of the neighborhood know for example that there are criminals correct i know that here they need security and they have to be very careful
and i often think ah mm that there can be crimes but there are those who do not although i think it is generally safe now
there is security in the quad because it used to not be as strict but now you have to go out there and give a person a card
and then it passed what was it called e this sysem to see if someone is really a student or not
they can't be false with the card and pass through right but now
but the thing is that when people left it was very easy to enter but now they have this system with a new gate thatthat
that you can't do anything right well in general they are very busy and the one at the university
oh ok here studying a a bit and well i got a call and i say why not why don't i take a rest right
eh e
yes
no e
yes
mhm
yes yes
well philadelphia has many dangerous neighborhoods because
e eh they have they are they are and the neighborhood is fairly safe right so one has here from the university that in general is also fairly safe but
s say if you go to to to the north like that in north philly all of that and south philly and west philly and well it's not necessary but more
i mean only that it's very very dangerous so but also all for example if you go out at night you're not going to go to north philly to go out so it's not so
and how are you how's school going
so important right
so well for us
yes because if if on is going to go out if on goes to philadelphia but if one's going to old city but then in old city there's so many people that goes out that there are many policemen there and everything
so
yes eh yes in general well also there are not so many students that go to old city in general the students are they stay here in in the university
i think eh yes well in general but people complain a lot that there is no security here that we're in a bad neighborhood and
in general it's it's that that yes yes every week one read the the the dp so there are there are eh once there
there was a a mugging or whatever so one goes one thinks naturally that it's it's happening a lot right but
in in reality it's a one things maybe that they mug or rob from i don't know two hundred students but there are about twenty thousand students and then the probability that the
that happens to oneself
uh um uh um
of course it exist right but it is not that high
yes yes
yes that's why i think that it's better to live in something like the university highrises because specially if you get home late at night
yes well it's nice to have
to walk a long time people lives like this in baltimore but the blocks in baltimore are huge they must to
yes huge huh
yes not light at all
yes not light al all but in the high rises is better is quiet and you don't have to buy all the forniture
if anything happens you call the university and they take care
but and and one has to also there are many and i heard about many stories of problems among people that share an apartment
hi
i'm in the linguist program
mhm mhm mhm
mhm
sure
no i mean i know the people who carry it and i know the ldc and what they do
but no
well the ldc what it does is collect many types of linguistic data be it text like tex eh the oral thing and then this can be used to for many things for for example
ah programs that that can understand voice need need some training don't need
a sample let's say
and it is then mm for example for that you can and and to study from how people pronounce a given letter even dialogue how it develops i don't know what i mean to
for many things and the ldc they do that they collect data in many languages and and then people
you can do more things more practical or for more studies more theoretical no
mm yes yes
hi i'm olaya in philadelphia
well i live in in west philly but well not very west let's say i live on fortythird and spruce
no not so west
and aha aha
mm
mm mm
well the truth is i like it a lot i mean before i came
they told me well and i read that philadelphia was so dangerous and such and
be careful with west philly in fact in in according to the guides they put in the campus is dangerous going at night
and i well this is my second year here
and the truth is i've never seen anything nor nothing has ever happened to me nor do i feel unsafe in general i mean maybe is because
are you spanish
i don't know i don't watch that much either don't watch the news here that scare you a little
and and i don't know nothing has ever happened to me and no i don't feel i don't feel in danger nor do i feel it is dangerous but well i know people people that really are scared of west philly and
yes but well mm
that is his that is his problem no that is i don't know
mhm mhm
yes mhm mhm yes that
n i mean tell me tell me
mhm
mhm mhm
yes
oh ok that's great where are you calling from
mhm mhm mhm
no let's see it is true that things happen i do if i meet a girl who i'm attracted to right
but these things happen in all cities don't they
and in all the cities there there are crimes and i don't know but i think here is
he gives as much importance and repeated a lot right and comes up on the tvs and in the newspapers and then creating a state just as well as a little collective
he's crazy right
yes
mhm mhm
mhm and west philly i don't know i think the neighborhood there are not so nice areas but it does has very nice areas that are very pleasant to walk through
and i don't know there are people who live in center city and that never happens right to come here and stroll
me too good
and and i don't know it seems to be a pleasant neighborhood to me that's the truth
mhm
yes yes yes mm
yes
mm i one time i was walking until the street sixty or something like that i started walking and i went
because i wanted to see what was there and
and well i found a normal neighborhood a poor neighborhood nothing like an ugly suburb with houses like they seemed old or bad not maintained like that
you would see poverty in some places
but but you couldn't see something unpleasant or something scary don't know like you saw
then well the wages in that neighborhood were like smaller than others no
i'm studying right now
and clearly also surprisingly you don't see white people on the street that too
those are the things that have surprised me more about philadelphia right the division the huge division that exists between
yes mhm
mhm mhm yes really sometimes it's funny mm i mm ah i take the bus in front of my house and sometimes when i get on the buss well everybody is black then the colors start changing right as the bus moves on
moves on towards the east and when you go to the west it's the other way around it's pretty
yes yes yes it's funny
sure sure it's related to their social class right it's not a racial thing that's for sure yes
where are you from from mexico
they say it's dangerous there right is it
mhm
in in upenn the unversity
right um but
uh um right
right um
wow
right right right
i heard that too i mean kidnappings like that
right right right yeah
wow
right
right right
yeah what do you do
mhm
and before not towards the people didn't complain for fear
mhm
already mhm
mhm mhm
mhm mhm
mm
mhm
mhm
wow mhm mhm
ha
wow that is impressive
mhm mhm
mhm mhm and no
i don't know how it will be in me sorry i mean i do not know how it is in mexico i think like here is when tv comes in
it infuriates it is the same it is scary cause news are very locals and very
going around and around each robbery and they explain and explain and
really
yes yes yes yes its morbid and i don't know what
and
ok
hi who an i speaking too
oh okay so you have something to do with this program
but yes yes
in mexico in mexico like is not that cause it is like to much
it's practically impossible to include every single robbery or every
every rape or every i don't know
every robbery that takes place do you understand then they put up just the ones that are really huge i mean when there are kidnappings
very drastic or when they are like the one the one of the dead women in juarez that are
ah ok
and for and i i mean with what purpose are they doing that program or what is it for
a
ah ok ah
ok ok
aha wow
aha
more specialized
wow ok listen and this where do you live here in philadelphia what neighborhood or
hi i'm arturo
ah ok ah well yes it is it is not too west as you say
yes yes i live on campus
but i live up on forty
in the high rises
and how do you feel the ambiance there living by forty three
yes
yes
aha
mm
yes that also
no no i'm from mexico
yes people black people no it's like there's not many people that are intimidated by black people here
e for me
yes of course no but it's like like like many people associate i west philly with like well the neigborhood like the ghetto no like l l
the black neighborhood and like unsafe
but
i mean i i don't feel that intimidated either or anything because i have a friend that lives near forty fifth
and and i walk that way very frequently and and at night too and everything
and e and i meet with many people too there sometimes at night because i have to cross this this park
and eh and there is many people there there is too eh at night so at two in the morning they're there partying and well eh
they have never threatened me and neither i mean they never go any further than asking me for a cigarette or something like that and that's it
from philadelphia as well of course yeah
no i mean in in truth i don't i don't see that they are provoking there like
ah okay
yes all of them yes yes yes
yes aha
yes yes
yes i think he is as you say and that this exaggerated then as people alone is the
as the the idea that this very insecure but truth is not so much i mean no it is rather the idealization and that they are thinking
they are much more serious than it really is
yes yes
not really
what are you doing in philadelphia working or studying
yes i do not i do not find it disgusting at all
then it isn't either singularly or specially beautiful or anything but then like i mean is like you say it has nice places where you can walk awhile and
and then this too i say like living here as a student then this like all the people is living here then at the same time like then they don't want to be too far from here because you are like disconnected from the university people then
also i think
that's why the ones that live in the campus are more comfortable
yeah and
and what did you found
aha
yes
yes no
oh okay
they get allot less yes
yes yes yes
yes it's a huge displacement i mean
i mean it's impressive to see the more you move to the west well the more black people you see less white people live there
yes yes yes
yes yes yes that's true i've only used the bus once but i do remember that too when i got on the bus that i started to notice that
everybody was black when the bus was going to the west
yes but well that's that too well it's a consequence of the i mean the fact that most people most black people well they are poor so well
sure yes more than anything it's just that but
yes from mexico city
oh me too
yes yes it's quite serious in there this thing i mean it's not that bad like like this i mean it's really bad
specially there's still lots of separation between social classes it's pretty evident i mean it's
i'm like i have like a a look more um let's say european i'm i'm blonde i have white skin and color eyes
and if i walk around some neighborhood there in mexico that's kinda insecure
you bet i won't even get out of there with a wallet
or i mean but in i in in one hour i mean they won't they won't take long to get me
and that's if they don't kidnap me i mean i'm more likely to be kidnaped
yeah it's impressive right now it's it's interesting because kidnaps they can kidnap anyone i mean it's no longer because you're from a family
a rich one no anyone they get him in a car they take him away and they call it  express kidnapping so they they they take you away and they get whatever they can from you i mean from a few
thousand dollars to if you have much more well what whatever you have but what you have i mean like that these people
yeah chemistry engineering fro undergraduate
is like very desperat so uh they do they're brutal really and it's
it's terrible but well uh but well really i mean lately there's been much more social awareness towards the the citizens i mean now they're starting to let's say fight again'st that do you understand so
the prople declare the the this the assualts now people if they object
i mean there has been much more this much more participation because before it was like then no one
yes why yes no and for the truth also the the security system was practically was useless i mean one declared a crime and
there was a submission of paperwork that i don't know did not lead to anything
e but then finally there have already been then say a little more this this affirming the action of of the police and things like that and trying to dial of to
catch more thieves and kidnappers and much more as well with this so people already feel that there is a little more response to to all this
before these allegations
before not so much but even so and also for example there was a march in in mexico a couple of years ago
and you
a year and a half ago almost was called the a silent march for the security of mexico in which all all the world took a walk to to
to the center of the city
and there were millionsof people it was filled
like everybody was dressed in white and on the streets
then you notice it that yes like is true something socially necesary like people are there already
much more attention to security
any other thing
yes
yes yes yes yes
yes
it is javier
and i mean can make a description of yours and
it would be good
and some day have you had trouble with going to court or that
yes
and it can can yes it could pass that too but but i don't know but they say that that that i mean it is optional if you if they send you a letter
eh is it optional that if you want or are you obligated to go i don't know exactly
aha
oh
of course it is
oh yes it is it is like they sent a letter to my friend like that but since he works i mean from six in the morning until four in the afternoon then no he said that he
eh the company's manager said that he was well someone who couldn't this couldn't miss no
exactly
well yes yes yes but i don't know i mean sometimes i think that it would be good because in the more than in the case of the
hello how are you uh this un i think this is good i have never participated in it as jury but i would like to someday i don't know about you
rapes of boys and girls
if you can serve as a juror and if so how is it you realize if the person is guilty
can help to faster justice is done i think it's good idea to be a jury
ah
today shrill
oh ok ok i will not stand it's ugly horrible
you what ah where they sent you this that what state
oh you living in canada oh
i'm here in new york
yes but what i was telling to you of my friend is in arizona because i was living there
oh yeah
so there in canda is the same system you think so
oh look mm oh good good so
i don't know like i said ehm if the day will come well uh yes yes it was but but like you say one must be careful no
oh that means they no uhm
to the but i i imagine that they must do like a meeting or a seccion to tell you to explain the case to you
you are already involved you decided ehm
oh i see i see i see i see
no too late
what which was your name right
petty oh sessy or jessy
no uh you know i sometimes say that this is a bit difficult because more than any compromising
oh besy oh
javier yes yes yes
oh you are already living in canada so then for how long
fifteen years wow
how can you resist the cold
i see
yes
i see
oh
oh
because maybe after you have if you cause a problem this is not how they have your i think they have as your record or your data in court is more safe i do not know
oh i see and in in what state that provinces or states
oh vancouver i see isn't that around washington state
yes and no oh yes yes you know i had plans to go i mean to vancouver because i had some bolivian friends there
but i lost contact with them and didn't go because they tell me the life there is a lot quiet don't know if it's true
oh
yeah yes yes
ah
then yes ah
oh an you're from where you from originally
oh yeah yeas i imagined that i'm from ecuador
yes
yes because i i listened some a little of your accent from salvador yes no good and then i will see some day if i can go because here i tell you
here the justice as right sometimes here also like sometimes right sometimes things aren't right
and and he and he come again
yeah tell me
right
like here in the united states
sure yeah i mean yeah they give you the gas chamber penalty or you know
right
oh right yeah yeah yeah yeah
right
yes yes
sure they they'll hurt her and she'll have a bad time but imagine that ok now a serial killer who has has killed someone and
and right then what to the gas chamber no since they have to punish him yes or no for a few years
yeah right that yes
hmm
yes well no
of course it is over there they are going to abate
what he did i don't know why whey oh why do people do that no
right but you know like i tell you neither
people are crazy
and like i tell you here it it is becoming difficult every time you listen to the comments that that there were in canada everything is more calm
a well a drug dealer or something
yes
oh i don't know medicare or something
yes
yes exactly
and there
more just then
how nice
listen how is the work opportunity there
what type whichever type construction
ya
oh yes yes you have reason no because you can say they are there and
oh
yeah yeah
oh no because
because i was listening to something that that that that this country canada needs a bunch of people right
oh well yeah there is there is there is a program it's on the internet where if you accumulate points like seventy four points and one
it's possible to go to work and the government helps with everything
yes
yes it exists
yeah you can
i'm half interested in doing this huh
alex oh besy
yes and they can have friends say you say that they are guilty and they can have those friends persue that person and kill them or their children
yeah
yeah
me no
oh yes
mmh
aha
no this well the letter they sent me this i i said no but i sent a letter to my doctor
telling him that i couldn't be sitting for a long time because because i have an illness that doesn't allow me to be sitting for a long time or walk for a long time or stand for a long time
and then they said that it was fine that i didn't have to serve in the jury
already and that was last year already
it does already and i imagine that he he asked for a letter
to send to the jury to already for him
oh hello
mmh
now for that yes but but well i would not like at all
no i am very shrill and that's all
no if something happens like violation of childrens i don't know they will put a video of something eh
oh no is very ugly yes
ah i live in canada
yes aha and you
oh aha
ok mhm oh
more or less i think i don't know
not to me i got a letter last year
i see aha
i see one must be careful i see it de depends but they don't tell you what what kind of case until the time when you get there maybe to the to the in front of the judge or or to the
or to where it has to be
yes but that is when you already you already said yes that you are going to do it already
i see to be a juror
i see and if you say or not i'm i don't want to do it now ehm too late
he already said yes already
besy besy i see
no besy with a b
i see aha and yours javier
but this for me to serve as a jury but i said i'd better not
that's it mine is easy
fifteen years already
i see i see
uhm well ehm i lived in a city before where it was super cold in the winter and there was a lot of snow
there was a lot of snow fall
and then my husband and i we decided to move to to make of the beach
in ano in another province
and then here here in the winter is like rain and nothing more
and it doesn't get so frozen
aha it is it is a province it is british columbia it is close to ehm where i live it is close to vancouver i don't know if you have gone to the city aha
mhm
yes yes then more or less yeah aha ya
oh aha
oh yeah is i person that talked to told me that you know you must be living i a paradise and i say why
because you have lots of islands and the sea close and you can go to to united states
with having a passport
you can go alone cross the border and
from here the border is like ten minutes from here
yes from washington yeah
the from el salvador
ah aha
i do not know as i say that jury service is something uh dangerous because well it depends on where you go to serve jury duty
yes yes
yes and there's
uh er sorry
no i there's this what's it called uh that let's say you kill someone and they give him the death penalty
uh there's are there any state there like that
the death the death penalty right
yeah but i i was watching something on the something on the news the other day about this lady uh she killed her three children
she she put them in water and the children drowned
and then my mom told me  no they should kill her drown her and i told her  it's better to throw her in jail because she'll suffer more in jail
while the other inmates know that she did and because she's
or that this is a a
or i mean that they'll tear her apart i think
i see sure something that makes him suffer no because if they just kill him and
suffered mm what ten minutes or whatever and it was but but if they put him in jail oh the other prisoners mm
poor guy
over there yes over there people do suffer i say
hmm over there he is going to over there he is going to pay for what he did already
right
who knows crazy people
hmm
i see here is is somewhat more calm yes
a case where someone has killed someone or or someone uh who sells drugs
because i imagine that the the health care of of the united states is not is that good or or is like the the ehm what is that called
what is a card that they give you for health called i don't know what it's called
yes medicare this
no it's not very good
o yes
ah here is i say it's good because
it's more just even though it's more just than
than there
they are looking for a ton of people to work in construction
of security i believe that it's to make buildings or something
what is your name of the
ya and they ask for other provinces
but if one has if one has the experience of building buildings or of building houses or something like that
i imagine that they can ask for a visa or or something i don't know
aha
at least in the in the province where i am uh this i heard on the news yesterday that they are they need people for
for this is to work in construction
where there
oh really oh that i didn't know
mm
mmhmm
hello hello g hello hello
uh negros and hispanics thinks like that you wanted to know
we all have one
yeah so it's like well it bothers me that something so simple like  you know you're puerto rican and i am dominican
no no no i know but
yea but what kills me is that we're so close in proximity
dominicans republicans santo domingo are what like nimety miles apart we are closer that florida and cuba
and we hate each other just because of where we were born what is that
exactly yeah but i you know
hm mm
it just it make me laught i usually don tell people until i am asked but i never deny my race like people say something and i'll stand and be like oh hold up
hm mm
hm mm
get out of here
oh thank you so much i speak spanish like a white person too
oh l let me find out ok that's another eh that's another things that bother me just because a person is um you waht what does it mean to some white
you know what i'm saying what
hm mm
no absplease i'll tell everybody i don't care
hm mm
aha
no it's not it's not your fault it's not
your fault is not to is you know people act ignorant around me all the time and say stupid things like that and it's like
oy yes they cri they always criticize they criticize if you get married
yes yes you are and you marry a hispanic woman cla
i i am uh of dominican father
so and eh both parents
yes ah well yes my my husband is puerto rican
so ah that was also a problem
with his family of course his don't like dominican people
so however when you look around that has nothing to do with race because even my husband says it if we were going to detail
alo but no it is good uh what is your name where are you from
things in each family if it were a family situation
my family is even there are more professionals in my family we are more educated uh
lamentably in in economical things we are more stable economically however
the one reason that they had for not liking me it was that the last girlfriend was years before he met me she was puerto rican
and i was from dominican parents born there grew up here
uh huh
g
uh huh
uh huh
yes uh i don't explain why the ignorance of
ok my name if jennifer from new york
of yes i have a a wife of my brother is eh um afroamerican she you know
what
uh er manhattan
oh ok so yeah so uh the subject to me uh i understand it having been uh raised here in new york um
i understand it and it's not a big deal for me as long as both people are happy
uh i don't i care little about them being green or yellow or
um um
oh ok oh ok and the funny part is that we're not all equal
because there are dominican persons in my own family that i don't like
i i don't like them
ok let's start this thing to finish fast
yeah
um
yes hm mm
yes but
but eh exactly i like to say to the people i speak to them in my professional life i speak with all types of people and i say
i say from where are you i'm dominican
what from where how could that be i think you are what does that have to do with anything
hm mm
yes
yes
ok so uh the theme is uh uh the interracial marriage
eh
hm mm
pebut that is
his your friend but that is ignorance because
tu sabes
yes
it is butno
exactly
that is don't havethat is i'm sorry that is ignorance
yeah this eh
oh yeah this is this is the theme of today so what do you think of interracial marriage
and still you you knowing that has nothing to do with that
that that doesn't change anything because still
aha
uh huh
there are all kinds of people in all races
well if there's one thing about the dominicans it's that they love to reproduce
to have children
yeah
yeah
well you know about that
hm mm
yeah it makes me want to speak english but i can't we can't
but all this is why my brother is a policeman here in manhattan
in the 23rd y there the ymca he and i worked in an inves uh as an investigator but i mostly work with the police
so in this
so just a second so i always tell you this always oh  where are you from after this they speak with me a bit that i helped they said things sure about the dominicans in front of me
they talked oh yea yes bla bla bla bla they asked me oh  where are you from dominican
oh
right
oh sure right
go on go on
and good i
sure
yes because
you can but that's it the difference is that you can criticize a person and describe him as that dominican stopped there in that corner
ok but yeah
yeah exactly aha
they are known because unfortunately the the worst dominicans the ones that always make stuff painted have a tattoo
they have a shirt they are
yes
oh yeah eh yeah yeah also that but not all of us are like that it is that that is the funny thing because when i was at college that was oh where are you from
new york oh oh what what how what what ethnicity are you oh i'm dominican oh no
but me i also asked what what do you think of uh if it is easier for certain races to marry like whites and chinese
i don't think so
yeah oh no that one that one is unfortunately tha's a a trait we all have but but still it's the whole point of
excuse me the point that um because we are and he have that atribute
no that does not mean that we all are the same
it's because i have female cousins that embarrass me because they are sluts basically
and no no but no no i understand you know it let's you go to the heart of it
they are like this and also other people
you know we are professionals and we do what we do it's said ok my grandma had a nice butt and the whole world hurt her
but
no
hello pardon
i don't believe that it is easier but it is more no no better because like a latin person with a latin but now the same thing depending where you live if you marry if i am latino and i get married to to dark or something
and that's all starts like even in chatrooms in the computers checking out the chatrooms
and that's just like crazy the way that we're fighting
yea well the reason why i part asked you why you are from new york because
like what part of new york because you sound like like white
yeah you sound like white
but no nothing nothing of course not now let the spanish come out
yeah like
like me when i told you i'm from the bronx i thought you were going to hang up because i had three callers i told them i'm from the bronx ad they hang up
they hang up on me
in in florida disney world
in many places maybe many people are going to criticize
it was a line ad we were standig a few excuse me'cause you had the line was moving but they weren't moving
and i had i said bronx new york and they oh honey come one they're from the bronx and they moved and they got off the line like
out embarrassed
i was like oh oh well
yeah
we are yes
yes but all the races what is your race
aha and your mother
both parents are dominican well i am puerto rican
yes
with his
yes
yes
john eh from new york
yes
yes i
yes no i i um i have dominican family
i have many cousins who are married to dominican women
and um he they have left them
divorced and all and they don't have contact and still the girls keep on each time that they see them oh we are that is my cousin or and they have they have lived with us and all
and always they have grown like oh they are my family we have become i have many dominican friends
i have black family too that my cousins have married dark uh
yes d where in new york are you
where in new york
and you oh
oh i'm in the bronx
yeah that's why i think so too i think
yeah
yeah me me too i have dated with girl girls from many different races
they're um i don't know i don't i don't care my first girl was dominican
yeah
yeah yeah just like just like me i have some friends that are dominican
but they don't say they're dominicans they don't tell people they're dominica much because they treat them wrong
because they're dumb and that and he says i have and they don't because their own family say they're dumb
like they tell them they're rude all that stuff and they're
but what is um topic did you hear
they are very um nasty
they themselves getbochonno and i told them that they shouldn't get bochonno because that's present in every race
yeah i know a man ok
no i know a man that is a policeman i am a policeman right
and i he always he has tattoos uhm of the puerto rican banner
and i believe that he has always been puerto rican up until two or three weeks ago that we had a barbecue for no two or more than tree weeks ago to say goodbye to summer
he was speaking there and the wife was speaking there and and he right that and that banner and i didn't know what that was and he said that the right on the banner was not dominican and that and that and he made
sus uhm like how when he became a citizen here
and that he always said he was puerto rican and that he changed his papers and everything to say that he is puerto rican
well he was born herebut he changed everything from the parents and all all that
oh ok because i don't hear very well me
yeah i said but and why did you do then he said because that people do not do not talk to menot him
do not want to know anything dominican i say but i that is not that way because just now there are puerto ricans that do not want to know anything about the puertoricans but
for the life they say oh i am puertorican
never saynever change i don t know why you should change it
and him well noi am i i am american puerorican american and with that i do not do
ah ime being dominican hey i am dominican because i can not change it
not like him that he been paying and payingto change allfor it to come out that he is puertorriy do and and from new york
hm mm
yeah where where where am i working today
there are many dominicans here in the bronx there are there are many puerto ricans but there are also dominicans
it is not important to me after that you're in love with a person
a lot of people say  oh dominicans are ignorant they don't know how to do anything there are a lot there are a lot of dominicans
they all say that there are more dominicans than white people
yes
yeah well and then the puerto ricans don't say anything but as they say the more hispanics the more latinos the better
the little white guys are those who have lots of dominicans and this and that
these puerto ricans want to grab every little thing here
that's right
i know well i'm getting up too
yeah yeah
yea
but you marry whomever you want
yes
yea i i also spoke about the dominicans that way
but in front of them and the same about the puerto ricans in front of them
speaking is one thing talking but there are some that speak about them and they shut up there until there until they win the point
because i i sometimes we are a group speaking and i say look he's a dominican that dirty so and so but i am speaking in a group with
two or three dominicans with two or three puerto ricans
with white guys that how we talk
but
sure because when i see a people in the street that i know that i see are dominicans that have a bandana or something they are dominicans
i ey dominican come here
no im i don't believe that it is important it doesn't have to be important to anyone either
like that yeah
yes like the
yes the women as well
what is from far for something
yes yeah
yeah yeah turn around
yeah
yeah
above sentence is in english yea oh no no i didn't mean it that way i meant it with the back part
yeah
me no

uh huh all right
ah okay
ah no i that work i wish i was working uh i wish i was going to school
but um
here in connecticut i think i spoke to you a week ago
yeah one no no doesn't think so but when one is in school there is where all the friendships are they don't have to go out for for ah you know communicating with their friends
no everyone's there right now in the very center you know
but now when one goes out and has to be at home and has to pay the the the household expenses it's very difficult it's better to stay in school
yeah by force yeah
no no no
oh yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah
of course yeah
eh yeah
yeah well that does not happen
yes it dropped the call dropped no
no no your abilities
in life when already when you are out of school everybody calms down you know they have their family or they get married or you know
you know they have children around there or and and life becomes more difficult no
yeah because because of that if you want to live the their life americans' i am going to say you know
the dream of all americans you know that that they want to buy their house this that
right
yeah
yeah
right yeah
yeah you're more more responsible in life
eh don't know why it drop
but you know but and the from a poors life its more its easier
a poors life has nothing to do with anything you know if you want to work you work if you don't want to work they support you
you know
yeah more or less same thing you know
but eh you have to find a a good woman that does this and that that can help you that that has that has a house or has an appartment that helps you this or that but
no but that's how life is well no you know
live and learn
right
right no but
you tell me the the large companies they are ate they giving you things
oh hi how you doing
don't you see the the large companies they giveaway the cars no money down they give the the things
yes
hello
there is many people don't know there there many calls that they are not processed then i beleived they do not know how many valid calls
have each person then don't know what vwhat they dobecause there are many persons that for example they have reached the twenty five calls
but she knows that there were many calls and it wasn´t that the call got cut then she doesn´t know what to do right
yes they still call her i don´t know two weeks ago yesterday they were calling her but i think they are still doing it i don´t know but
i imagine that it is i imagine that it is but and ah yes is that at the end the thing is that i think is not well organized it surprises me because
they have done it several times the lcd because they did it two years ago or a year and a half ago
but before yes it was eh it was in english but there was too in arabian and in spanish and whatever but yes yes that is an old story they have make it many times then i don´t know or at least one time
and that time of many months i don´t know now because suddenly is something new ah
no
ah i know no no no and it is not that only that the the recorder that was i imagine some some kind of computer or something that they have there ah
hello good night
and that i said it was my theory they said that the text was written in english about what they wanted to say
what what that i hear right
the they went to the car this translator then they entered the text there
from english to spanish and then there from from that they copied it to a computer that that that did i don't know what e e then that there are computers or there are programs that one
enters enteres a text then the computer the computer reads it
yes yes no no then then the translator was something like that kind i can imagine
then what was said
i imagine it was that that was a computer
then no no no it just had a very bad accent but it also everything it said for example when calls ended it said
your time is pointing upwards
good who am i talking to
yes no no no not i i didn't either well i i i didn't even notice until until several times really that i heard it that that that i didn't understand anything really
and then one time there i heard ah yes your time is pointing upwards o for example one time what was it what did they have am the the subject was dating
then
the the translation to spanish was to give the date of a day then that like that how do you like to give the date of a day things like that that are
uh unbelievables but and and they obviously have some people that speak spanish true uh i don't know that is no e
it hasn't been well very very very well organized
mhm mm yes shudong yes but the good is that they pay well in the end one is a bit at at times a bit bothered that way to have to answer and
but no no it isn't that much there and they pay well
mhm
mhm
ah david is joe or joejose
mm mhm
ah a surprise
yes in philedelphia yes yes well well my mother lives in the outskirts i live here eh in in west philly in
iin the university so
i am here i am here close mm
no no university of pennsylvania yes no no yes it is different yes that everybody gets confused with that because there are eh well penn state
it is in in the center of of the state
and it is eh it is it is a public university
and then am it is then the university where i am it is the university of pennsylvania
yes exactly yes it is private and it is in the city it is completely different the other one it is much larger it is public it is in the country
ah good good and where do you live
ah
i don't know eh well i have never gone there i i don't know exactly where it is
but what do i know what is that is downtown well maybe if he at eightyfirst maybe one maybe but but even though eightyfirst i think it is going to
no possibly yes possibly yes because i know that eightyfirst goes i don't know better i better not say anything i
yes my e e e yes yes all i know of of eightyfirst is that because before we used to live in tennessee
and north east
and then there near virginia well they are we lived in virginia then we went to tennessee but over there i took the eightyone that is all that i know
it seems like it's the highway is long i don't know i don't know but yes e but then you but you just you are studying or what or what do you do
mm ah okay
much easier i imagine
aah yes yes yes how are you
yes yes yes yes
yes it's a good but it it the good thing about being in school is that it's one thing that now when one finishes now the expenses of one go up
quite a lot right then it's one now buys a car and and and wants this wants the other then now one has to start to work right for for supporting oneself while one you are a student one lives there
in a little there one i don't know i don't know if you are familiar with ramen noodle soup
no no no those soups of that they sell for of ramen that cost yes twentyfive cents
yes one lives on ramen noodle soup for twentyfive cents the twentyfive cent dinner one then no it's so
un you spend a lot less but it is a life that is more quiet yes it is quiet but also i i think that that when people remember when they were students they forget everything of all the work that you also go through right but
yes yes but also it is a life where you have more freedom more flexibility with time like for example if tonight if i want to spend
every night awake and then i don't know studying and i don't have classes tomorrow it doesn't matter right because i don't have or or if some day i don't want to go to class i don't go to class right
but at work you can not say ah yes i didn't want to go to work today
yes don't know why
just yes no no no it is like that very flexible like that
mm
a lot harder
yes yes yes the problem is that i feel that that when that no that is what you have to to to to be happy with all all that you have and that seems to me that is what
many people don't because you your income rises and with that obviously and the work responsibilities increase right
but at the same time
everything that one consumes its one one goes to buy a better car and one maybe does this and does that and so when one looks money flew away right and one only stays with that's what it looks like to me only with the responsibilities right
then i don't know its like i don't know now im happy as a student for now right but eventually for sure one has to save and buy a house but
i don't know that scares me a lot that of having fixed costs right because its like one works and works works
and one feels that that you're not enjoying your money right but that in part is because one says well one thinks of all the benefits that one gets right but also
ahyes i do not know what they will do with that because also
one has a car to go to work right then one has to have this to then one has to cut the grass i don't know its seems like a lot
too much like that fixed costs is fixed responsibilities its i don't know
yeah definitely
yeah right
yeah yeah that's how it is
your wife supports you
yeah
yes yes
yes
yes no well eh it seems that if there is there is that is why why one has to like this i think careful with with
many calls that that have dropped and foryes looks like
how one wastes money because it is very easy because for example if if you buy one thing then buy another and another and another i one has nothing and one feels that oneself is not not going to enjoy money true
one has to seriously see
what is most important right what what is what i like
and if not it is not that then it is better not to spend money on that right
that is what is seems like
